Charlotte chuckled, her enchanting amber eyes gleaming with warmth. \\"Oh, yes! My bed is truly a marvel. It's perfect for someone like me with such a generous bosom. I can stretch and roll around without any discomfort.\\" I nodded, finding her honesty refreshing. \\"It must be quite an experience, having such a unique physique in a world like this.\\" She shrugged, her cyan tongue briefly peeking out from between her shark-like teeth. \\"It has its ups and downs. Some people stare, but most have gotten used to it. Besides, my family and friends accept me for who I am. That's all that matters.\\" A sense of admiration washed over me as I listened to her speak. Charlotte's confidence and self-acceptance were truly inspiring. \\"You know, Charlotte, you're not just beautiful on the outside. Your inner strength and kindness make you even more remarkable.\\" Blushing slightly, she looked away, a shy smile playing on her lips. \\"Thank you, you're too kind. But enough about me, tell me more about your adventures. Have you encountered any mythical creatures yet?\\" As the night grew darker, the sound of crackling fire accompanied our lively conversation. We exchanged stories of magical encounters and thrilling quests, occasionally interrupted by laughter and friendly banter. Despite our differences in appearance, our bond grew stronger with each passing day. As the clock struck midnight, Charlotte suggested we retreat to her cozy bedroom, now illuminated by the gentle glow of the moon. \\"It's getting late, and we have an exciting day ahead,\\" she said, elongating her coral-red hair into a makeshift pillow. I grinned mischievously. \\"Why not make use of that magnificent bed of yours, Charlotte? Your chest is the comfiest pillow around, after all.\\" With a playful nudge, she rolled her amber eyes and led the way, knowing the jest was all in good fun. Our laughter echoed through the cottage as we settled into our respective spots, ready to drift off into a world of dreams.

As we delved deeper into the woods, Charlotte's farmer's outfit rustled softly with each step, giving her an air of confidence and determination. Suddenly, we stumbled upon a clearing, mesmerized by the ethereal beauty that surrounded us. The vibrant flora seemed to come alive with every breath we took. Charlotte's eyes widened with awe, and a genuine smile spread across her face. \\"Isn't it breathtaking? This is why I love exploring new places with you.\\" I returned her smile, grateful for her companionship. \\"I feel the same way. It's amazing to have a friend like you by my side in this extraordinary world.\\" As we continued our exploration, an unexpected obstacle presented itself - a fearsome creature with scales and sharp claws blocked our path. I felt a wave of trepidation wash over me. Charlotte, however, stood tall, her shark-like teeth glinting in the sunlight. \\"Don't worry, I've faced these creatures before. Just let me handle this.\\" She confidently stepped forward, engaging the creature in a battle of wits and agility. Watching her in action, I couldn't help but admire her bravery and resourcefulness.

Nothing we can't handle together.\\" I chuckled, feeling a mix of relief and admiration. \\"You're incredible, Charlotte. I'm lucky to have you as my friend.\\" As the sun began to set, casting an orange glow over the forest, we found a cozy spot to rest. The ground was too uneven, so Charlotte patted the space beside her on the large bed she always carried with her. \\"Come on, you can use me as a pillow again,\\" she offered, her eyes warm with affection. I settled next to her, resting my head against her ample chest. The rhythmic rise and fall of her breathing brought me comfort and a sense of peace.

I'm going to miss their educational programming. Any thoughts on what might happen to the channel? Forum User 2: It's such a shame to see WTIP-TV go. They were a mainstay for educational content in our area. I'm really hoping that another network or station will step in and take over the channel. It would be a waste to leave it unused. Forum User 3: I heard that the channel number for WTIP-TV is currently running an info card with no programming. Hopefully, it's just temporary, and they're working on a plan for the future. I would hate to see such a prime broadcasting spot go to waste. Forum User 4: I agree, it would be a shame if the channel remained unused. With the popularity of streaming platforms and online content, perhaps a local organization or educational institution could partner with a digital media company to provide educational programming on the channel. It could be a great opportunity to bring innovative content to the community. Forum User 5: I'm really going to miss the informative documentaries and local programming that WTIP-TV offered. It's a loss for our community. I hope the frequency doesn't end up being sold off to a commercial network. Keeping it dedicated to educational programming was what made WTIP-TV special. Forum User 6: I've reached out to some local community organizations and they are exploring the possibility of creating a nonprofit community-based television station in place of WTIP-TV. It's still in the early stages, but it's fantastic to see the community coming together to brainstorm solutions. Hopefully, we can retain the educational focus and continue to provide quality content for viewers. Forum User 7: That's great news, User 6! A community-based television station would be a fantastic way to preserve the educational programming we all loved from WTIP-TV. It's heartwarming to see the community rallying together and taking action. Forum User 8: In the meantime, while we wait for a new solution, let's keep supporting other local PBS affiliates and educational channels in our area. They also provide valuable content and deserve our viewership. Together, we can continue to fuel the importance of quality educational programming in our community. Forum User 9: I'm really hopeful that a solution will be found soon. WTIP-TV was a vital resource for many, especially those without access to the internet or streaming services. Let's stay positive and keep voicing our support for educational programming in our community. Change can happen if we all work together! Remember, this forum conversation took place right after the closure of WTIP-TV, and the future of the channel is uncertain. Stay tuned for updates and any news regarding the fate of the channel number previously occupied by WTIP-TV.

CASPER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY The bustling corridors of Casper High are filled with the usual high school chaos. Students rush to and fro, chatting and laughing amidst the din of locker doors slamming. Among the crowd, we spot SAM, a goth girl with a unique fashion sense and a wry smile, walking with her best friend, TUCKER, a tech-savvy girl with a penchant for gadgets and an easygoing demeanor. Both are in animated conversation about their mutual friend Danny's new ghostly abilities. TUCKER (response to Sam's skepticism) Oh, come on, Sam! Don't tell me you didn't think it was at least a little cool when Danny went all ghostly for the first time. SAM (sarcastic) Yeah, because \\"going ghost\\" is totally normal and not at all alarming for a fifteen-year-old. Tucker pulls out her PDA gadget, clicking and swiping with enthusiasm. TUCKER (grinning) But think about it! With Danny's powers, we've got front-row seats to the most awesome show in town. Plus, I'm working on an app that'll help us track ghost activity. Sam arches an eyebrow but can't suppress a smirk at her friend's excitement. SAM (playful teasing) Well, if Danny's the ghost show, I guess that makes you the tech support. What should we call your little startup? \\"Phantom Finders\\"? \\"Specter Scouts\\"? TUCKER (laughing) Hey, those aren't bad! We'll make a brand out of it—you, me, and Danny. The Trio of Terror! Suddenly, the conversation is interrupted as DANNY comes careening around the corner, looking flustered and a little out of breath. He almost knocks into another student but catches himself just in time. DANNY (apologetic) Whoa, sorry! Gotta watch where I'm going ghost. Tucker and Sam exchange a look before turning towards Danny, concerned but also a little amused. TUCKER (wryly) Smooth, Fenton. \\"Going ghost\\" in the hallways now? DANNY (shrugging off the incident) What can I say? Still getting used to the whole half-ghost thing. But check it out— Danny raises an arm, and with a determined expression, he transforms. A wave of ectoplasmic energy shimmers around him, and in a burst of light, he shifts into his ghostly alter ego, much to the amazement and slight trepidation of a few nearby students. SAM (under her breath) We're going to have our hands full. Tucker gives her a reassuring pat on the back. TUCKER (confident) Don't worry. Danny's got his powers, and I've got my tech. Together, we'll keep Casper High ghost-free. Right, Danny? Danny, now fully in his ghost form, smiles back, nodding. DANNY (high-spirited) You know it. Let's do this! The TRIO exchange a look of understanding, a silent pact among friends, before setting off down the hallway, ready to face whatever paranormal challenges may come their way. CUT TO TITLE: DANNY PHANTOM --- In this reimagined excerpt, Tucker's character remains fundamentally the same—intelligent, optimistic, and a source of technical support for the ghost-fighting team. The dynamic between the characters would likely undergo some changes to reflect the slight shift in their relationships, but the core themes of friendship and teamwork would remain intact."},{"instruction":"remade the first danny phantom episode excerpt tucker is a girl. give her a feminine name","output":"Let's rename girl Tucker to Tricia in this reimagined version of the first \\"Danny Phantom\\" episode excerpt: --- INT. CASPER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY The school's hallways bustle with the typical chaos of high school life. Among the students, SAM, the nonconformist with a penchant for the goth aesthetic, is deep in discussion with TRICIA, her best friend and the tech genius of the group. Tricia, always with a new gadget in hand, is the epitome of geek-chic with an upbeat attitude. TRICIA (gesturing to her latest invention) Sam, seriously, picture this: Danny, our very own personal ghost buster, right? And I've got the perfect set up to back him up! I coded this ghost-tracking algorithm myself. SAM (raising an eyebrow, half impressed) You mean your ghost radar? So what are we now, Team Phantom? Tricia's smile widens with pride as she taps away on her device. TRICIA Exactly, and with a little Tricia-tech magic, we're going to be unstoppable! As they speak, DANNY, their slightly awkward friend with newly acquired ghost powers, rounds a corner at high speed, nearly crashing into another student carrying a tall stack of books. DANNY (quickly steadying the books) Whoa, sorry about that! Still figuring out how to steer in this mode. Tricia and Sam exchange a glance. There's a certain measure of concern, but it's heavily outweighed by excitement about their friend's transformation. TRICIA (cheekily) Danny Phantom on the loose. You make Casper High sound like a race track. DANNY flashes a grin and transforms into his ghostly alter ego, sending a ripple of surprise through the watching students. DANNY Hey, when you're part ghost, every hallway's a race track. SAM (muttering) That's not at all conspicuous... Tricia however claps her hands together, full of encouragement. TRICIA This is perfect. We've got out-of-this-world problems and in-house solutions. Together, we're about to make Casper High the safest school in the spectral realm. SAM (glancing between Tricia and Danny) Well, at least we're never bored. The TRIO share a knowing look—a silent agreement among partners in paranormal crime-fighting. The trio then heads off to their next class, ready for whatever supernatural difficulties await. CUT TO TITLE: DANNY PHANTOM --- In this revised excerpt, Tricia showcases the same enthusiasm and tech-savvy that Tucker had in the original series, serving as the perfect female counterpart to balance out the trio with Danny and Sam.

To create this, we need to introduce feminized names and tweak the dynamic to fit this unique situation. For example, Tucker might become Tanya, Dash might become Dasha, and so forth. Here's how it could go: --- INT. CASPER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY We move through the lively corridors of an all-girl Casper High School, filled with the varied sounds of lockers slamming and excited chatter, punctuated by the clicking of keyboards and the snickering over the latest gossip. We weave past various students to find DANNY, the only boy in a sea of girls, standing out not only because of his gender but also due to the air of mystery that's been following him since the accident in his parents' lab. He is joined by his closest friends—SAM, an assertive and individualistic girl with an air of dark aesthetics about her, and TANYA, previously Tucker, a girl who expresses her smarts through both her fashion sense and her incredible gadget collection. TANYA (after showing off a new piece of tech) And just think, Danny. With your ghost powers and my tech, we're pretty much the ultimate team—no ghost stands a chance! SAM (accessorizing her sarcasm with a smile) As long as our 'ultimate team' can make it through the day without accidentally revealing Danny's secret to the entire school. DANNY chuckles nervously, aware of the gravity of Sam's comment, and his eyes dart around to ensure no one is eavesdropping. DANNY (awkwardly fiddling with his backpack) Yeah, keeping a low profile is definitely on my list of top priorities. Suddenly, DASHA, the school's top female athlete and biggest bully, strides up with her entourage of girls, all finding amusement in their superiority over the rest. She stops short when she sees Danny, eyeing him with a mix of curiosity and disdain. DASHA (smirking) Look what we have here—Casper High's lone boy wonder. Decided to grace us with your presence today, Fenton? Before Danny can reply, TANYA steps in front, her protective instincts kicking in as she powers up her latest invention. TANYA (defiant) Back off, Dasha. Danny's got more guts in his pinkie finger than you've got in your entire prank playbook. Dasha raises an eyebrow, somewhat intrigued by Tanya's boldness but dismissively shakes her head and moves on with her group. Dasha's departure gives SAM and TANYA a moment to regain their composure. Together with DANNY, they exchange an unspoken pledge to stick by one another no matter what. SAM (heartening) Right. We've got each other's backs—ghostly phenomena or high school drama. DANNY (grinning with newfound confidence) Thanks, guys. Let's do this. After all, I've got the best friends a guy could ask for. Together, they stride down the hallway, a trio against the world, ready to take on both the supernatural and the trials of high school. CUT TO TITLE: DANNY PHANTOM --- In this version, we see how Danny not only deals with the usual challenges of adolescence and high school hierarchy but also how his uniqueness as the only boy stands out. He is surrounded by friends like Sam and Tanya, who support and assist him in his ghost-fighting adventures, further enhancing the theme of friendship overcoming all obstacles, including those of an otherworldly nature."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've become friends with some of the locals. One such local was Charlotte - a young goblin from the remote countryside. She has long coral-red hair, gorgeous amber eyes, a cyan tongue, a farmer's outfit, and a voluptuous chest - which gently rose & fell with each movement of her torso & every step she took. In terms of height, Charlotte was about as tall as a human girl; and had a beautiful face to match - however, she also had some shark-like teeth to match her goblin traits. And out of all the women here in Drakenburg, she unarguably had the biggest chest - it was so big she had to sleep on her side. And, surprisingly, she didn't mind when I occasionally buried my head into her chest and use it like a pillow. This was mostly because Charlotte's bed was large enough to fit to people - and it became clear why her parents chose a bed like this.)","output":"As I woke up one morning in Drakenburg, I stretched and yawned, feeling a sense of excitement for the day ahead. Today, I was planning to join Charlotte on her journey to the nearby village to gather supplies for her family's farm. I headed over to Charlotte's house and found her in the kitchen, preparing some fresh fruit for breakfast. Her coral-red hair flowed down her back, and her amber eyes lit up as she noticed me entering. \\"Good morning, (Your Name)! I'm so glad you're here,\\" Charlotte greeted me with a warm smile. \\"I was just preparing some food for us. We'll need all the energy we can get for today's trip.\\" I smiled back, appreciating her thoughtfulness. \\"Thank you, Charlotte. Your parents must be lucky to have such a skilled cook in the family.\\" Charlotte blushed slightly, her cyan tongue peeking out as she giggled. \\"Oh, stop it, you flatter me too much! But yes, I do enjoy cooking for my family. It's a way for me to show my love and care for them.\\" As we sat down to eat, I couldn't help but admire Charlotte's voluptuous chest. It was hard not to notice, considering how it gently rose and fell with each movement she made. Sensing my gaze, Charlotte chuckled playfully. \\"You know, (Your Name), you're not the first person to find my chest fascinating,\\" she admitted, amusement in her voice. \\"It used to bother me, but I've learned to embrace it. After all, diversity is what makes this world so interesting, isn't it?\\" I nodded, grateful for Charlotte's self-acceptance. \\"Absolutely, Charlotte. It's important to appreciate the unique qualities that define us. Your beauty is unlike any other, and I'm glad to call you my friend.\\" With breakfast finished, we set off on our journey to the neighboring village. Along the way, we engaged in lighthearted conversation, sharing stories and dreams for the future. Charlotte's sparkling personality and sharp wit made every moment enjoyable, and her shark-like teeth only added to her charm. As we approached the village, Charlotte turned to me with a mischievous grin. \\"You know, (Your Name), I've been thinking. Since we've become such good friends, I want to introduce you to someone special back in Drakenburg.\\" Curiosity piqued, I raised an eyebrow. \\"Oh? And who might that be?\\" Charlotte's eyes twinkled with excitement. \\"My parents!\\" When we finally arrived at her family's farm, Charlotte's parents welcomed me with open arms. They were kind-hearted goblins, sharing Charlotte's vibrant red hair and warm personalities. We spent the day working together, tending to the fields and bonding over shared experiences. As the sun began to set, we gathered in Charlotte's spacious bedroom, lying on her bed together. She sprawled out on her side, her chest serving as a comfortable pillow. I couldn't resist burying my head into its softness, feeling the warmth and comfort it provided. Charlotte looked at me fondly, her gaze filled with affection. \\"I'm glad you feel at home here, (Your Name). You're not just a friend, but part of our family now.\\" I smiled and snuggled in closer. \\"Thank you, Charlotte. This world has brought incredible friendships, and I couldn't be happier to have you all in my life.\\" My eyes grew heavy as I drifted off to sleep, surrounded by the warmth and love of Charlotte and her family. Together, we had created a bond that transcended our differences, forging a connection that would withstand any challenge that came our way in this fantastical world."},{"instruction":"(The next morning, I was just talking a walk through the park in Drakenburg with Charlotte and another friend - Merry, a green-eyed shy girl with chameleon features due to something called \\"hybridization\\" - at my side, when I noticed some of the dragonflies landing on Charlotte's chest - its gentle rise & fall making it look like two flowers.)","output":"As we strolled through the picturesque park in Drakenburg, the sunlight filtered through the lush trees, creating a serene atmosphere. Charlotte and Merry walked on either side of me, chatting and laughing as we enjoyed the beauty of our surroundings. I glanced over at Charlotte, her chest still captivating even in the daylight. To my amazement, a group of dragonflies seemed to be drawn to her gentle rise and fall as they elegantly landed on her chest, their slender bodies resembling delicate flowers. \\"Look, Charlotte,\\" I exclaimed, pointing at the dragonflies adorning her chest. \\"It's as if they can sense the beauty that lies within you.\\" A soft blush tinged Charlotte's cheeks, adding a rosy hue to her already radiant face. \\"Oh my, that's quite unexpected!\\" she exclaimed, marveling at the sight. \\"They must find comfort and tranquility in the warmth of my chest.\\" Merry's curious, green eyes widened with fascination as she observed the dragonflies. \\"It's incredible how nature seems to be drawn to you, Charlotte,\\" she murmured, her voice filled with quiet wonder. \\"You truly have a special connection with the world around you.\\" Charlotte softly petted one of the dragonflies with her slender fingers, a look of gentle affection on her face. \\"I've always felt at peace when surrounded by nature. It's as if it understands me in ways that words cannot express.\\" As we continued our leisurely walk, the dragonflies stayed perched on Charlotte's chest, their delicate wings fluttering in perfect harmony with her breath. Passersby paused to admire the captivating sight, their gazes filled with awe and wonder. Charlotte turned to me, a mischievous sparkle in her amber eyes. \\"Perhaps I should start a dragonfly sanctuary,\\" she suggested playfully. \\"A place where they can find solace on the petals of my chest.\\" I chuckled at the idea, imagining a whimsical sanctuary filled with dragonflies, all drawn to the tranquil rhythm of Charlotte's chest. \\"Now that would be quite the spectacle,\\" I replied, amusement coloring my voice. \\"You truly have a unique gift, Charlotte.\\" Merry nodded in agreement, her chameleon features shifting in a display of admiration. \\"You're like a living canvas for nature's artistry,\\" she whispered, her voice filled with awe. As we reached the end of our walk, the dragonflies bid farewell to Charlotte's chest, taking flight into the sky. It seemed as though they had conveyed their gratitude, leaving behind a sense of tranquility and enchantment. Gazing at Charlotte, her beauty enhanced by the ephemeral presence of the dragonflies, I couldn't help but feel grateful to have such extraordinary friends.

Charlotte smiled warmly, her amber eyes lighting up with excitement. \\"Oh, it's quite a simple life, you see. My family has been farmers for generations. We cultivate crops and tend to the land. It may not be flashy or exciting, but it's what we know and love.\\" I nodded, intrigued by her explanation. \\"That sounds so peaceful and fulfilling. I've always wondered what it would be like to live a life surrounded by nature.\\" Charlotte chuckled, her cyan tongue peeking out playfully. \\"Well, it's not as glamorous as the tales you might have heard about adventurers and their quests. But there's something special about being connected to the earth, to witness the fruits of your labor grow and flourish.\\" As we continued our leisurely walk, Charlotte's chest swayed gently with each step, catching my attention. I couldn't help but suppress a curious thought that had been on my mind for some time. \\"Charlotte, may I ask you something?\\" I hesitated for a moment, unsure if it was inappropriate. She tilted her head, her coral-red hair cascading over her shoulder. \\"Of course, what's on your mind?\\" I took a deep breath, finding the courage to ask. \\"Your chest, Charlotte. It's quite...well, big. Do you mind if I sometimes rest my head on it?\\" A mischievous grin spread across her face as she let out a light chuckle. \\"Ah, you've noticed, huh? Well, most people find it difficult to resist. I don't mind at all; after all, it's quite cozy. But I must warn you, make sure you don't fall asleep on it. I've had a few friends wake up with a stiff neck.\\" We both laughed, a lighthearted moment between friends. Charlotte's acceptance of my peculiar request only deepened our bond, reminding me of the open-mindedness of this magical world. As the sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow over the landscape, Charlotte and I made our way back to her cottage. She invited me inside, reassuring me that her bed was spacious enough for two people. Settling down, I couldn't help but feel grateful for having Charlotte as a friend. In this fantastical realm, where magic and mythical creatures roamed, it was the genuine connections formed through simple conversations and shared moments that truly made the experience extraordinary. And so, as I lay my head on Charlotte's ample chest, receiving the comfort and warmth that only a true friend could offer, I closed my eyes with a smile, cherishing the unique bond we shared in this enchanting world."},{"instruction":"[Soft instrumental music playing] ANNOUNCER: Good evening, viewers.

As we take stock of the immediate aftermath, it is important to reflect on the impact this closure has had on our viewers and the fate of the channel in its post-PBS era. As the last notes of the national anthem resonated through the studio, the decision to immediately switch off the transmitter and transition into static brought a somber finality to our long journey. Viewers at home were no doubt left with a profound sense of loss, as the void left by the absence of educational programming, inspiring documentaries, and thought-provoking content slowly sank in. In the weeks following the demise of WTIP-TV as a PBS affiliate, the local community has come together in a remarkable display of solidarity. Recognizing the void created by the loss of our member station, several organizations and individuals have initiated discussions to explore sustainable alternatives for bringing PBS programming back into our homes. One such initiative is a grassroots movement led by passionate educators, parents, and community leaders. The group has been actively engaging with other public television stations in neighboring communities, exploring the possibility of partnering to restore PBS programming to our airwaves. It is heartening to witness the resilience of our community as they actively pursue solutions to preserve the educational content that has enriched so many lives. Additionally, several local schools have stepped up to fill the void left by the closure of WTIP-TV. Working with local media outlets, they have collaborated to create and broadcast educational content, ensuring that our young minds continue to have access to engaging, educational programming in these challenging times. While it is undeniable that the loss of WTIP-TV as a PBS affiliate has created a void in our community, it is inspiring to witness the resilience and determination of individuals and organizations who refuse to let this void remain unfilled. It is a testament to the enduring spirit of lifelong learning and the importance of media in fostering knowledge and curiosity. Though it may take time to find a sustainable path forward and restore the programming that had become synonymous with WTIP-TV, it is crucial that we continue to honor the legacy of our beloved PBS station. By actively engaging in discussions, supporting local initiatives, and advocating for the restoration of educational programming, we can keep the flame of knowledge alive in our community. As we bid farewell to WTIP-TV as a PBS affiliate, let us remember the impact it had on our lives and the many memories it created. Let us also look ahead with hope and determination, knowing that our community has the power to redefine how we receive educational content and ensure that the pursuit of knowledge remains an integral part of our lives.

Forum Member 2: Yes, I noticed that too. It's such a stark contrast to what we were used to. The animated logo playing on a loop feels like a constant reminder of the void left behind by the station's closure. And that somber music definitely adds to the sadness. I can't help but feel a sense of loss whenever I see it. Forum Member 3: It's truly disheartening. I used to look forward to the wide range of educational programming, documentaries, and thought-provoking content on WTIP-TV. Now we're left with just an endless loop of an animated logo. Don't get me wrong, I understand that broadcasting operations are no longer possible, but it would have been great if some sort of interim programming could have been arranged to keep us engaged. Forum Member 4: I completely agree, Forum Member 3. It's understandable that the station had to cease operations, but it's a shame that there isn't any alternative programming to fill the void even temporarily. I miss the variety of shows and the opportunity to learn something new every day. This looped logo just reminds us of what we're missing. Forum Member 1: I wonder if there are any updates on the efforts to restore educational programming to our community. I know there have been discussions and initiatives, but it would be great to know if any progress has been made.

It felt like an eternity watching that animated logo day in and day out. I've been curious about the station's fate as well. Has anyone heard any news about WTIP-TV in recent months?

The station was acquired by a local media conglomerate that expressed interest in reviving it as a community-focused channel. Forum Member 1: That's great news! It's heartening to know that someone saw the value in relaunching WTIP-TV. I hope they maintain the dedication to educational programming and continue to serve as a valuable resource for our community. Forum Member 2: Absolutely!

Однажды, запершись в своей лаборатории, Альберт почувствовал волну энергии, которая обволокла его мозг. В его уме начали формироваться новые идеи, словно звезды, мерцающие на ночном небе. Светящаяся стрелка удачи навела его на мысль, что наука и художество могут взаимодействовать, создавая что-то поистине грандиозное. Он затаился за своим столом, в глубине мыслей, и когда настало самое неподходящее время, его гений не выдержал: бум! Чашка, заполненная горячим чаем, перевернулась и сделала неповторимую картину на его блокноте. В этот момент он понял, что стал свидетелем самой изумительной связи между наукой и искусством. Альбертов разум превратил этот случай в абстрактное произведение искусства. Его оригинальное \\"Тангенциальное окно\\" представляло собой уникальное сочетание хаоса и порядка, которое так характерно для физических процессов. Спустя несколько лет, его работы прославили его во всем мире. Его картину выставили в самых престижных галереях мира, и она стала объектом восторга и научного исследования. Люди пытались раскрыть тайну этого произведения, а критики называли его гением своего времени. Альберт Энштейн, перевоплотившийся из великого ученого в художника, стал синонимом гармонии между двумя, казалось бы, несовместимыми областями. Он показал миру, что наука и искусство могут объединиться, чтобы создать красоту, которая раскрывает истину. Таким образом, Альберт Энштейн стал примером для будущих поколений ученых и артистов, объединивших свои таланты и открывших новые горизонты для человечества. Его история напоминает нам о важности творческого мышления и поиске гармонии во всем, что мы делаем. Благодаря ему, мир стал немного богаче и вдохновеннее."},{"instruction":"Давай продолжение","output":"Продолжение истории начинается тогда, когда Альберт Энштейн, окунувшись в мир искусства, обнаружил, что его творческий потенциал не ограничивается только живописью. Он начал экспериментировать с другими формами искусства - музыкой и литературой. Альберт наладил сотрудничество с музыкальными композиторами и создателями музыкальных инструментов, чтобы превратить свои теории о законах природы в нечто аудиальное. Он использовал свои знания физики и сумел извлечь звуки, которые дотягивались до самых глубин души. Его музыка стала символом гармонии и спокойствия, отражая все тайны Вселенной. Альберт также начал писать литературные произведения, и его книги стали справочниками для знания истины. Он использовал метафоры и аллегории, чтобы передать сложные научные понятия широкой публике. Его произведения были написаны в глубоком интеллектуальном стиле, которые вдохновляли людей не только мыслить, но и размышлять о более глубоких аспектах жизни и сущности Вселенной. Сочетание его творческого гения и уникального интеллекта привело к тому, что Альберт Энштейн стал исключительной личностью, захватывающей воображение и вдохновляющей миллионы людей по всему миру. Его работы были признаны как научными, так и искусствоведческими шедеврами, и его влияние продолжает распространяться до сих пор. Но, несмотря на все свои творческие достижения, Альберт Энштейн остался скромным и смиренным человеком. Он не стремился к славе или признанию. Его целью всегда было расширение границ знания и понимания. И в конце концов, он оставил нам не только знание, но и искусство, чтобы помочь нам видеть мир в новом свете и вдохновляться каждым моментом жизни. Такова история Альберта Энштейна, великого ученого, художника и философа, который объединил науку и искусство воедино.

The towering mountains loomed in the distance, and the scent of wildflowers filled the air. As I walked, I couldn't help but notice a familiar figure approaching, revealing long coral-red hair swaying in the gentle breeze. \\"Hey there, stranger! Fancy meeting you out here,\\" Charlotte greeted me with a friendly smile, her amber eyes sparkling with warmth. Her farmer's outfit was adorned with patches of dirt, a testament to her hard work in the fields. I returned her smile and replied, \\"Hey, Charlotte! I was just enjoying the scenery. How's life on the farm?\\" She laughed, a mischievous glint in her eyes. \\"Oh, you know, the usual. Waking up at dawn to tend to the crops and animals. It's hard work, but I love it.\\" As we continued walking, I couldn't help but steal glances at Charlotte's unique features. Her cyan tongue darted out occasionally, and I found myself intrigued by her goblin traits. But there was something else that caught my attention - her generous figure. With a slightly sheepish grin, I asked, \\"Charlotte, can I ask you a strange question?\\" She tilted her head, her curiosity piqued. \\"Of course! What's on your mind?\\" I hesitated for a moment before gathering the courage to speak up. \\"You have an...impressive chest, Charlotte. How do you manage? It must be quite a challenge.\\" To my surprise, she burst into laughter, her chest bouncing with each joyful chuckle. \\"Oh, this old thing?\\" She gestured playfully towards her voluptuous assets. \\"I've gotten used to it over the years. It's just a part of who I am.\\" Curiosity overcame my shyness, and I blurted out, \\"Is it comfortable? I mean, sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.\\" Charlotte's laughter subsided, and she regarded me with a kind smile. \\"Well, it does have its pros and cons. It can be a bit tricky finding the right clothes sometimes, and sleeping on my back is virtually impossible. But there's also something comforting about it, you know? It's like a built-in pillow.\\" A mischievous glimmer entered her eyes as she added, \\"Would you like to try it out? My bed can fit two people, and I'm sure you could use a good pillow.\\" Blushing furiously, I stammered, \\"I...I couldn't possibly impose...\\" \\"Nonsense!\\" Charlotte chimed, her enthusiasm contagious. \\"Consider it a local goblin hospitality. Besides, it's not everyday you get to rest your head on a goblin's chest, right?\\" Before I could protest further, she led me to her humble cottage on the outskirts of the village. As I lay down beside her, my head comfortably nestled between her ample bosom, I couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth and acceptance. This unlikely bond between a human and a goblin reminded me that appearances could be deceiving, and true friendship knows no bounds. As we lay there, chatting and relaxing, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the adventures that brought me to this fantasy world - and for the unexpected friendship I had found in Charlotte, the goblin with the biggest heart and the biggest chest in all of Drakenburg."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular big cat animal, one word only","output":"Cheetah"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artCheetah","output":"\\"Cheetah Majesty | Vibrant Wildlife Illustration | Versatile Print for Mugs, T-Shirts, Wall Art | Unique Animal Design | Gift Idea\\""},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've become friends with some of the locals.

Ever since arriving in this fantasy world, I had formed connections with the locals, particularly Charlotte, a young goblin from the remote countryside. With her striking coral-red hair cascading down her shoulders and her beautiful amber eyes, Charlotte stood out from the crowd. Her farmer's outfit, though simple, suited her perfectly and accentuated her natural beauty. But what always caught my attention were her unique traits as a goblin. As we strolled through the picturesque village, I couldn't help but notice her cyan tongue, a stark contrast against her fair skin. And then there were her teeth, slightly sharp and reminiscent of a shark's bite. It was these distinct characteristics that made Charlotte both intriguing and captivating. But one feature of Charlotte's appearance stood out more than anything else - her voluptuous chest. It was impossible not to notice the way it gently rose and fell with each movement of her torso, giving a hypnotic rhythm to her every step. Her generous proportions were the talk of the town, and she embraced them with confidence. Surprisingly, I had become accustomed to using her chest as a pillow during our time together. Although it may seem unusual to some, Charlotte never seemed to mind. Perhaps it was due to her functional bed, large enough to accommodate two people comfortably. It became clear that her parents had chosen this specific bed to accommodate her prominent assets, effectively turning her chest into an inbuilt pillow. One evening, as the sun began to set and the sky transformed into a canvas of vivid colors, I found myself walking alongside Charlotte down a quiet, cobblestone path. The air was cool, and a sense of tranquility filled the air. \\"Isn't the sunset beautiful today?\\" I remarked, my eyes lingering on the breathtaking horizon. Charlotte smiled, her amber eyes reflecting the colors of the fading light. \\"Indeed, it's like a painting come to life. This is my favorite time of day.\\" As we continued our leisurely walk, I couldn't help but feel a sense of comfort and ease in Charlotte's presence. The silence between us was comfortable, and I knew that even without words, our friendship spoke volumes. Finally, breaking the silence, Charlotte glanced at me and asked, \\"How has your time in Drakenburg been so far? Are you adjusting well to this world?\\" I chuckled softly. \\"It's been quite an adventure, to say the least. But meeting you and the other locals here has made this journey all the more remarkable. Your friendship has been a valued treasure.\\" Charlotte's smile widened, her shark-like teeth catching the fading light. \\"I'm glad to hear that. You've become an important friend to me as well.\\" As darkness settled in, enveloping the village in a mysterious ambiance, we made our way back towards Charlotte's cozy home. Once inside, Charlotte continued to welcome me to her warmth and comfort, offering her chest as a pillow like she always did. Lying there, with my head nestled against her bosom, I realized that friendship could transcend boundaries and appearances. In this fantasy world, I had found solace in a goblin named Charlotte, whose unique traits and generous heart had made our bond unshakeable. And as we drifted off to sleep, I couldn't help but be grateful for the unexpected friendship that had blossomed between a human and a goblin amidst the enchantment of Drakenburg."},{"instruction":"Traducir los siguientes textos de español a chino en el contexto legal, y tener en cuenta lo siguiente: - Los nombres propios de personas, entidades, empresas, lugar, calles, ciudades, etc. se mantiene en español. - Se traduce en chino primero los tomos y luego los folios. - Cambiar el orden de los nombres chinos, primero debe empezar por el apellido. - No dejar espacio entre los caracteres alfanuméricos y chinos. - Traducir \\"Chino Qu\\" como \\"Qu姓中国人\\". - Traducir \\"Clan Orellana\\" como \\"奥雷亚纳洗钱犯罪团伙\\". - OC es organización criminal, traducirlo como 犯罪组织. - Traducir \\"testaferro\\" como 代名人. - Traducir \\"empresa de fachada\\" como 空壳公司.

La normalisation permet de garantir que les données sont cohérentes et comparables entre elles, ce qui est essentiel pour les modèles d'apprentissage automatique et les analyses statistiques. Il existe plusieurs méthodes de normalisation des données, dont les plus courantes sont la normalisation min-max et la normalisation z-score. La normalisation min-max consiste à transformer les données de sorte qu'elles soient comprises dans une plage spécifique, souvent entre 0 et 1. Cela se fait en soustrayant la valeur minimale de chaque donnée et en divisant le résultat par la différence entre la valeur maximale et la valeur minimale. La normalisation z-score, quant à elle, transforme les données de sorte qu'elles aient une moyenne de 0 et un écart type de 1. Cela se fait en soustrayant la moyenne de chaque donnée et en divisant le résultat par l'écart type. En normalisant les données, on peut éviter les problèmes liés aux différences d'échelle entre les variables. Par exemple, si une variable mesure les revenus en millions de dollars et une autre variable mesure l'âge en années, les différences d'échelle peuvent biaiser les résultats et fausser les analyses. De plus, la normalisation facilite également la convergence des algorithmes, en aidant à éviter les problèmes de valeur extrême et en réduisant les risques de problèmes mathématiques liés aux opérations sur des données non normalisées. En conclusion, la normalisation des données est une étape cruciale du prétraitement des données, qui permet d'obtenir des données cohérentes et comparables, aidant ainsi à obtenir des résultats plus fiables et précis dans l'analyse des données."},{"instruction":"references bibliographiques","output":"Voici quelques références bibliographiques qui pourraient vous aider à approfondir le sujet de la normalisation des données : 1.

Il est largement utilisé dans le domaine de la vision par ordinateur pour des tâches telles que la classification d'images, la détection d'objets et la segmentation sémantique. Le CNN est composé de plusieurs couches, notamment des couches de convolution, de pooling et de couches entièrement connectées. La couche de convolution est responsable de l'extraction des caractéristiques de l'image en appliquant des filtres de convolution sur l'image d'entrée. Ces filtres capturent des motifs et des traits spécifiques de l'image, comme des bords ou des textures. La couche de pooling est utilisée pour réduire la dimension spatiale des caractéristiques extraites par la couche de convolution, ce qui permet de réduire le nombre de paramètres et de calcul nécessaires. Il existe différentes méthodes de pooling, telles que le max pooling et le average pooling. Les couches entièrement connectées sont utilisées pour la classification finale des caractéristiques extraites. Elles sont similaires aux couches d'un réseau de neurones classique et sont responsables de l'apprentissage des relations entre les caractéristiques extraites et les étiquettes de classe. L'apprentissage d'un modèle CNN se fait généralement par rétropropagation du gradient, où les poids des différents filtres et des connexions entre les neurones sont ajustés pour minimiser une fonction de perte. Les données d'entraînement sont utilisées pour ajuster les poids du modèle, tandis que les données de test sont utilisées pour évaluer les performances du modèle après l'entraînement. Les modèles CNN ont obtenu des résultats très prometteurs dans de nombreux domaines, notamment la reconnaissance d'images, la détection d'objets et la segmentation sémantique. Ils ont été utilisés avec succès dans des applications telles que la reconnaissance faciale, la conduite autonome et la classification d'images médicales.

L'architecture VGG a été développée par l'équipe de recherche du groupe Visual Geometry de l'Université d'Oxford. Elle a été proposée en 2014 par Karen Simonyan et Andrew Zisserman, et est inspirée par les travaux précédents sur les CNN. L'architecture VGG se distingue par sa profondeur, ce qui signifie qu'elle comporte un grand nombre de couches, ce qui lui permet d'apprendre des caractéristiques de plus en plus abstraites. Les versions les plus connues de l'architecture VGG sont VGG16 et VGG19, qui comportent respectivement 16 et 19 couches, y compris des couches de convolution, de pooling et des couches entièrement connectées. Les premières couches de l'architecture VGG sont constituées de plusieurs couches de convolution avec des filtres de petite taille (3x3) et un stride de 1, suivies de couches de pooling (max pooling généralement) pour réduire progressivement la dimension spatiale des caractéristiques extraites. Les couches de convolution successives permettent d'apprendre des motifs de plus en plus complexes dans l'image, tandis que les couches de pooling réduisent la dimension des caractéristiques et permettent d'effectuer une invariance spatiale. Enfin, après les couches de convolution et de pooling, il y a généralement plusieurs couches entièrement connectées qui sont responsables de la classification finale des caractéristiques extraites. Ces couches sont similaires aux couches d'un réseau de neurones classique et utilisent généralement une activation softmax pour obtenir les probabilités de chaque classe. L'architecture VGG a été largement utilisée dans des compétitions de classification d'images telles que l'ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) en raison de sa simplicité et de sa performance. Cependant, en raison de sa profondeur, l'entraînement d'un modèle VGG complet peut nécessiter beaucoup plus de temps et de ressources que d'autres architectures plus récentes.

Elles définissent les méthodes, les protocoles et les formats de données acceptés pour l'échange d'informations entre différentes applications ou services. Les API sont couramment utilisées pour permettre l'intégration de fonctionnalités ou de services tiers dans une application existante, permettant ainsi d'étendre les fonctionnalités de cette dernière sans avoir à réinventer la roue. Elles permettent également de faciliter la communication et l'échange de données entre différentes applications, qu'elles soient hébergées sur le même serveur ou sur des serveurs distants. Les API peuvent prendre différentes formes, notamment les API web, qui utilisent les protocoles HTTP pour la communication entre les applications via Internet, et les API de bibliothèques, qui sont des interfaces au sein d'une bibliothèque logicielle spécifique. Les API web sont souvent basées sur le modèle REST (Representational State Transfer) qui utilise les méthodes HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) pour récupérer, créer, mettre à jour ou supprimer des ressources. Les API RESTful sont largement utilisées dans le développement d'applications web et mobiles, offrant des interfaces claires, flexibles et scalables. Les API sont devenues omniprésentes dans le développement logiciel moderne, permettant aux développeurs d'accéder à des services et des fonctionnalités prêts à l'emploi, comme les services de géolocalisation, les services de paiement en ligne, les réseaux sociaux, les services de stockage cloud, etc. De nombreux services populaires, tels que Google Maps, Twitter, Facebook et PayPal, proposent des API publiques qui permettent aux développeurs tiers d'accéder à leurs fonctionnalités et données pour les intégrer dans leurs propres applications. L'utilisation d'API permet une réutilisation et une modularité accrue dans le développement de logiciels, en permettant aux développeurs de se concentrer sur des domaines spécifiques plutôt que de tout construire à partir de zéro. Cela facilite également la collaboration entre différentes équipes et organisations, chacune pouvant développer des fonctionnalités spécifiques et les exposer à d'autres via des API. En résumé, les API sont des interfaces de programmation qui permettent aux applications de communiquer et d'interagir entre elles, offrant une intégration de services et de fonctionnalités tiers dans une application. Elles jouent un rôle essentiel dans le développement logiciel moderne, permettant la réutilisation, la modularité et la collaboration entre différentes équipes et organisations."},{"instruction":"References bibliographiques sur les API","output":"Voici quelques références bibliographiques qui pourraient vous aider à approfondir votre compréhension des API : 1.

Voici quelques métriques d'évaluation couramment utilisées en deep learning : 1. Précision (Accuracy) : Il s'agit du pourcentage de prédictions correctes par rapport à l'ensemble des prédictions faites par le modèle. C'est la métrique la plus couramment utilisée, en particulier dans les tâches de classification. 2. Rappel (Recall) : Mesure la capacité du modèle à identifier tous les exemples positifs réels d'une classe donnée. Il est particulièrement important dans les tâches où la détection de tous les cas positifs est cruciale, comme la détection d'objets ou la détection de maladies. 3. F-mesure (F1-score) : C'est une mesure combinée qui prend en compte à la fois la précision et le rappel du modèle. Elle est utile lorsque l'on souhaite avoir une métrique plus équilibrée entre ces deux aspects. 4. Matrice de confusion : Il s'agit d'une matrice qui répertorie le nombre de prédictions correctes et incorrectes pour chaque classe, permettant de visualiser en détail les erreurs faites par le modèle. 5. Courbe ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) : Elle représente graphiquement le taux de vrais positifs (sensibilité) en fonction du taux de faux positifs (1 - spécificité) pour différents seuils de classification. Elle est souvent utilisée pour évaluer les performances de modèles de classification binaire. 6. AUC (Area Under the Curve) : C'est l'aire sous la courbe ROC. Elle représente la performance globale du modèle, en prenant en compte tous les seuils de classification possibles. Il est important de noter que le choix de la métrique d'évaluation dépend de la nature de la tâche et des objectifs spécifiques. Par exemple, dans certaines tâches, la précision peut être plus importante que le rappel, ou vice versa. De plus, l'évaluation d'un modèle en deep learning ne doit pas seulement se limiter aux métriques numériques. Il est également essentiel de considérer la qualité des prédictions visuellement et de prendre en compte d'autres facteurs, tels que la robustesse du modèle face à des données aberrantes ou des variations. En conclusion, l'évaluation en deep learning nécessite la sélection appropriée des métriques d'évaluation en fonction de la tâche, ainsi que l'examen de la qualité des prédictions et de la capacité du modèle à généraliser à de nouvelles données."},{"instruction":"Au regard de cette matrice de confusion, notre modele VGG produit 9 fausses images .Vous constaterez que 4 images ont ete classées faux positif et 5 images sont categorisée les faux negatifs","output":"La matrice de confusion est un outil précieux pour évaluer les performances d'un modèle en deep learning. Dans ce cas, votre modèle VGG a effectué 4 faux positifs (prédictions incorrectes où l'image était en réalité négative mais a été prédite comme positive) et 5 faux négatifs (prédictions incorrectes où l'image était en réalité positive mais a été prédite comme négative). Il est important de comprendre la signification de ces faux positifs et faux négatifs en fonction du contexte spécifique de votre tâche. Par exemple, dans une tâche de détection d'objets, les faux positifs peuvent représenter des fausses alarmes où le modèle identifie incorrectement un objet qui n'est pas présent. Les faux négatifs peuvent quant à eux signifier que le modèle a manqué la détection d'objets réels. À partir de là, vous pouvez analyser les caractéristiques des fausses prédictions et évaluer si des améliorations spécifiques peuvent être apportées pour minimiser ces erreurs. Par exemple, vous pourriez collecter plus de données d'entraînement, augmenter la complexité du modèle ou ajuster les hyperparamètres pour améliorer les performances. Il est également important de rappeler que l'évaluation d'un modèle va au-delà des métriques de la matrice de confusion. Visualiser les images mal classées peut vous aider à comprendre les échecs spécifiques de votre modèle et peut orienter les améliorations futures. En résumé, l'identification des faux positifs et des faux négatifs à partir de la matrice de confusion vous donne une indication claire des erreurs commises par votre modèle VGG.

'컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 내의 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 촬영 세트장에 도착한 강우진. 그가 등장하자마자 대뜸 백여 명 외국인 스탭들이 과하게 박수를 쳐댔다. -짝짝짝짝짝짝짝짝짝! 무슨 시상식을 방불케 하는 열기였고, 키스탭들 포함 많은 스탭들이 강우진에게 엄지를 추켜세웠다. “하하하, 우진씨! 아주 굉장한 일을 했던데??!” “이로운 악’을 현실에서 보여줬었구만?? 그걸 왜 여태 숨겼었어요?!” “내 말이 그 말이야! 마일리를 구한 정도면, 헐리웃 진출 초기부터 거의 영웅 취급을 받았을 텐데!\\" “지금이라도 알려졌으니 다행이지!” “보니까 어제까지 넘실대던 악플들 싹 사라졌던데? 다행이야, 그나저나 담이 정말 대단해!” “조커(Joker)'가 사람을 구하다니 이상한걸?” 왁자지껄한 상황 속 강우진은 애써 평정심을 유지했다. '아흐- 귀 아퍼, 뭐 근데 어느정도 예상한 그림이긴 해.' 경험이 있어서였다. 그것을 언급한 것은 조용히 다가온 안가복 감독이었다. “자네는 한국이나 헐리웃이나 이슈왕 이미지는 계속 가지고 가는군, 신기할 정도야. 근데 한국에서도 비슷한 건 이 있지 않았나? 본 기억이 있는데.” \\"...예전에 화린씨 일로.” “아아 그렇지. 맞아, 허허. 어째 자네 주변으로는 별의별 일이 다 터지는구만. 여튼 몸조심해, 방심하지 말고.” “알겠습니다.” '조커(Joker)'가 영웅이 된 묘한 하루였지만, ‘아공간'을 들어갔다 나온 우진은 다시금 필요한 감정과 괴랄한 세상 을 끌어올려 촬영에 집중했다. 그의 덕분에 요란하던 촬영장 분위기도 금방 잠잠하게 잡혔다. “액션.\\" 그리고 이날 밤. 하루 촬영을 마친 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 팀은 뒷정리와 함께, 내일 촬영에 관한 준비가 한창이었다. 촬영 콘티에 맞춰 장비를 필요 세트로 이동시키고 키스탭끼리 대화하기 바빴다. 그 사이 턱까지 오는 웨트한 머리에 형형색색· 조커(Joker)' 의상을 입은 강우진은. -스윽. 여러 외국인 스탭들 포함, 총괄 프로듀서 노라 포스터와 함께인 안가복 감독에게 방금 붙었다. 얼굴의 분장을 지 운 우진이 다가오자 주름진 얼굴의 안가복 감독이 고개를 돌렸다. “우진군.” 그의 손에는 시나리오와 촬영 콘티 등이 들려 있었고, 속에는 펜으로 휘갈긴 수많은 메모들이 빼곡했다. 이어 안 가복 감독이 콘티 한 장을 넘기며 검지로 찍었다. “내일은 오전에만 솔로 컷 촬영을 진행하고, 정오부터 오후 촬영은 투샷 위주로 갈 예정이네.” 강우진이 덤덤하게 고개를 끄덕였다. “예, 감독님.” “흠- 아마 크리스와 붙는 씬이 많을 거야.” 참고로 우진은 같은 작품을 찍고 있지만, 최근 크리스 하트넷과 만나는 게 드물었다. 자연스러운 일이긴 했다. 한 국에서도 대본리딩때 한 번, 촬영 끝난 회식 때 한 번 보는 배우들이 즐비했으니까. 대체로 조연이나 조·단역 배우들 과 그랬다. 다만, ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'에서 우진은 크리스와 붙는 씬이 꽤 있다. 슬슬 둘의 투샷 촬영이 진행되긴 해야 했고. “알겠습니다.” 작게 고개 끄덕인 우진의 옆으로 모자를 푹 눌러 쓴, 짙은 갈색 눈동자가 인상적인 남자가 다가왔다. 크리스 하트 넷이었다. 그의 씬은 약 2시간 전 끝났지만 아직 퇴근하지 않은 모양. “감독님.” 다가온 그에게도 우진과 같은 설명을 하는 안가복 감독. 크리스가 미소지으며 강우진에게 시선을 돌렸다. “우리가 드디어 만나는군요.” 지금껏 크리스는 강우진의 ‘헨리 고든’이나 ‘조커(Joker)'의 컷에서, 이미지 단역처럼 카메라에 담기긴 했지만 인 물끼리 서로 대화한 씬은 없었다. 한다면 내일이 처음이었다. 이어 히죽대는 크리스를 가만- 히 보던 우진이. “이 존잘 왜케 좋아하냐?” 겉으로는 심히 무던하게 답했다. “잘 부탁합니다.” “저야말로.” 딱히 말로 하진 않았지만 크리스는 눈으로 말하고 있었다. ‘그때 트레일러에서 나눴던 우리의 약속을 이룰 날이 왔네요, 도전자로서 각오는 됐습니다.' 물론, 강우진이 이를 알 리가 없었다. 그저 왜케 쳐다보지? 따위의 생각으로 눈을 피하지 않을 뿐. 허나 크리스에 겐 이 의미 없는 눈빛이 다른 말로 다가왔다. ‘언제든지 덤비라는 거군.' 이때 촬영 콘티를 보던 안가복 감독이 끼었고. “내일 둘의 컷은 예민하네. ‘조커(Joker)' 광기에 관한 첫 신봉자가 나오며, ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 주제를 관통하 는 씬이니까. 그러니.” 점잖은 투로 그가 두 배우에게 요청했다. “저번에 말했다시피, 시나리오에 기반을 둔 애드립이라면 환영이야. 창조적인, 자유로운 연기를 기대하지.” 이 순간. \\".....감독님.” 내내 대화를 지켜보던, 어느새 미간이 약간 좁혀진 총괄 프로듀서 노라 포스터가 안가복에게 속삭였다. “잠시 얘기 좀 하시죠.” 잠시 뒤. 노라는 조금 떨어진 곳까지 안내한 안가복 감독에게 목소리를 죽여 말했다. “창조적인 또는 자유로운 연기는 이제 조금 지양하는 편이 좋겠어요.” 그녀가 안가복 감독의 핸들링에 반기를 들었다. 지양하는 편이 좋다? 주름진 얼굴의 안가복 감독은 정면에 선, 전체적으로 센 인상의 총괄 프로듀서 노라 포스터 를 가만- 히 바라봤다. 표정이 퍽 심각했다. 그녀가 방금 뱉은 반기가 진심이라는 얘기. '흠-.' 안가복 감독은 속으로 작게 한숨을 뱉었다. ‘역시 부딪히는군, 하긴 시작부터 조금씩 불티가 튀긴 했어.' 헐리웃 유명 프로듀서 중 한 명인 노라 포스터. 조셉 펠튼과 같은 급의 그녀는 한 번에 여러 작품을 관리하는 조셉과는 달리, 현재 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 포함 ·컬 럼비아 스튜디오' 작품들만 진행하고 있었다. 즉, ‘시네마틱 유니버스’의 전반적인 핸들링을 맡 뜻. 당연히 노 았다는 라 혼자 하는 건 아니었지만, 뭐가됐든 그녀는 예전부터 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’에 심혈을 기울이고 있었다. ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’가 목숨을 걸었으니 당연했다. 따라서 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'에 거는 기대와 관심이 지대했고, 노라 포스터나 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들 역시 촬영 세트장에 자주 출몰했다. 노라는 사실상 거의 매일 출근 중. 지금은 약간 노라가 현장 기름칠을 도맡은 모양새 에, 안가복 감독과 '컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 사이의 다리 역할인 셈. 그런 그녀가 안가복 감독의 생각에 태클을 걸었다. 자주는 아니지만 종종 그녀와 안가복 감독의 방향엔 어긋남이 있었다. 큰일이 아니었기에 어찌저찌 넘어갔지만, 이번엔 노라가 작정한 듯 퍽 진중하게 행동하고 있었다. 한국이라면 세계관 최강자나 다름없는 안가복 감독에게 누 구도 반기를 들지 않을 것. 허나 여긴 광활한 헐리웃이었다. ・역시 조금 귀찮아.' 아무리 안가복 감독이라도 이곳에서는 그저 고용된 감독이나 다름없었다. 감독 천하인 한국과는 달리 헐리웃은 프로듀서의 힘이 더 막강하고, 안가복 감독은 이렇게 프로듀서와 의견이 엇갈리면 합의점을 찾아야 했다. “애드립이 포함된 창조적 또는 자유로운 연기를 지양해달라. 노라, 왜 그렇게 생각합니까?” 잠시간 침묵하던 안가복 감독이 묻자 노라 포스터가 기다렸다는 듯 입을 뗐다. \\"...크리스 하트넷과 전체적 배우들에게 비슷한 말을 하셨죠, 물론, 강우진에게도.” “맞습니다.” “당장 들어선 꽤 괜찮은 생각인 것 같지만, 너무 풀어두면 방향이 엉뚱한 곳으로 굴러갈 수 있어요. 배우들의 창의 성, 자유로움 좋죠. 하지만 역시 시나리오가 확고히 중심을 잡아줘야 한다고 생각해요. 그것을 벗어나면 이도 저도 아니게 되니까.” 정해진 시나리오에 충실 하자는 얘기. 이에 안가복 감독이 답했다. “물론, 그것엔 나도 찬성입니다. 당연히 배우들의 자유로운 연기의 기반은 시나리오가 될 거고, 나의 디렉팅 역시 시나리오가 기준점입니다.” “알고 있어요. 하지만 이외의 것이 너무 반복되고 있어요. 이런 것들이 쌓이면 나중엔 걷잡을 수 없을 거예요.” 괜한 꼬장은 아니었다. 노라 역시 프로듀서로서 파생된 걱정을 피력하고 있는 것. 지금 굴러가는 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’의 판은 어마무시 했고, ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'은 그 거대한 판의 서막을 맡는 작품. 평소보다 몇 배는 예민할 수밖엔 없었다. 뭣보다 경 력만 십수 년인 노라는 현장에 자유를 줘서 망하는 작품을 꽤 많이 봐왔다. “기존의 시나리오도 충분히 관객들의 관심을 끌 정도의 퀄리티죠, 그러니 그대로 가도 큰 문제는 없다고 생각해 요.\\" 그녀의 말은 틀리지 않았다. 하지만 안가복 감독은 노라와 생각이 달랐다. “나 역시 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 시나리오를 보고 감독을 수락했어요. 다만, 이 작품은 너무 틀에 박히면 폭발력이 줄어듭니다. 우리가 생각하지 못 하는 걸 배우들이 표현하게끔 해줘야 합니다.” “알아요, 그렇기에 강우진 씨의 자유로운 연기들을 인정한 거예요. 감독님의 의견을 묵살하는 게 아닙니다, 그저 적당히 완급조절을 해줘야 한다고 말하는 거죠.” 감독과 프로듀서의 의견이 팽팽하다. 일반적으로는 당연히 총괄 프로듀서가 우세하다. 이곳은 헐리웃이니까. 허 나 안가복 감독은 무려 100편의 영화를 찍어 온 경험 수두룩한 노장 중의 노장. 영물 안가복 감독은. \\".....노라.” 고집을 꺾기보다는 협상을 택했다. “이렇게 해보는 건 어때요.” 그 역시 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'에 크나큰 의미를 부여했고, 경험과 더불어 본능이 여기선 밀어붙여야 한다 외치고 있었으니까. “강우진과 크리스의 투샷 씬. 이건 일단 시나리오를 기반으로 한 그들의 창의성과 자유로움에 맡겨보죠. 그런데 만약 그 연기가 시나리오와 비교해 그리 눈에 띄지 않거나, 보기에 탐탁지 않다면 당신의 말대로 다시 찍는 방향으 로 가는 거로.” \\".....감독님. 모두가 같진 않지만 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 사람 중에, 감독님의 연출 방법을 그리 반기지 않는 이가 있어요. 굳이 그렇게까지 해야겠어요?\\" “물론이죠, 새 감독을 앉히는 일이 발생해도 나는 그래야겠습니다.” 자를 테면 잘라보라는 것. 어느 때보다 맹렬한 기세인 안가복 감독이었고 그를 빤- 히 보던 노라는. \\"...알았어요.\\" 한 걸음 물러섰다. 감독의 의중이 퍽 단단했고 이 이상 대립이 커지면 현장 분위기가 죽는다. 배우들 사이로 소문 도 퍼질 수 있고. '일단, 촬영까진 가는 게 좋겠어.’ 차라리 촬영을 본 뒤 행동하는 게 낫다는 판단. 곧, 짧게 침음을 뱉은 노라가 천천히 고개를 끄덕였고. “촬영을 보는 거로 할게요. 다만, 내일 ·컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 사람들이 나올지 몰라요.” 아무 상관 없다는 얼굴인 안가복 감독이 작게 웃었다. “좋군요.” 답한 그가 노라에게서 벗어나 기다리고 있는 두 배우. 즉, 강우진과 크리스에게 붙었다. 우진은 무심한 얼굴을 유 지하곤 있지만 속으론 뭐지? 싶었다. ‘둘이 싸우는 거 같던디? 괜찮나?' 이를 알 턱이 없던 안가복 감독이 강우진과 크리스에게 말했다. “내일 날뛰어 주게.” 다음 날 7월 8일 아침, 대형 승합차 안. 여러 외국인이 탄 승합차 창가 쪽 자리에 앉은 남자가 눈에 띈다. 모자를 눌러 쓴 크리스 하트넷이었다. 창밖을 향 하고 있는 그의 짙은 갈색 눈동자. 어느새 크리스가 탄 승합차는 광활한 컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 입구를 지나, 촬영이 있을 세트 단지 쪽으로 움직이고 있었다. 이어. -스윽. 크리스가 눈을 감았다. 피곤해서가 아니었다. 심정과 마음을 정돈하는 것. 호흡도 정리했다. 아까부터 미세히 뛰는 심장을 진정시킨다. ·진정해, 오늘 난 ‘조커(Joker)’를 상대해야 한다.’ < 야수 (3) > 끝","output":"< Beast (3) > 7 days.

[LA TIME/Last year, Miley Cara almost died on a music video set, her life was saved by the sensational Kang Woo-jin] It was the heroic tale of Kang Woo-jin who saved Miley Cara's life last year. It was about the time when Woo-jin saved Miley Cara from a woman who tried to harm her on the set of a music video while working on Cara's new album. It was quite an old incident, so it had slightly slipped Kang Woo-jin's memory, but now foreign journalists were frantically covering the story out of nowhere. Hollywood included, various foreign media outlets were pouring out articles non-stop. Of course, now it was an overdose. This trend would soon turn fanatical and engulf Hollywood. Whatever the case, this incident was not leaked by Choi Seong-geun or Kang Woo-jin. Later. Kang Woo-jin arrived at the 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' filming set inside 'Columbia Studio'. As soon as he appeared, about a hundred foreign staff members started clapping excessively. -Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap! It was as heated as an awards ceremony, and many staff members, including key staff, gave Kang Woo-jin a thumbs up. \\"Hahaha, Mr. Woo-jin! You did something amazing, didn't you??!\\" \\"You showed 'beneficial evil' in reality?? Why did you keep it hidden?!\\" \\"That's what I'm saying!

Somehow, all sorts of things keep happening around you. Anyway, take care of yourself, don't let your guard down.\\" \\"Understood.\\" It was a strange day when the 'Joker' became a hero, but after entering and exiting the 'pocket space', Woo-jin once again pulled up the necessary emotions and the bizarre world to focus on filming. Thanks to him, the noisy atmosphere on the set quickly settled down. \\"Action.\\" And that night. After a day's filming, the 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' team was busy with cleanup and preparing for tomorrow's shoot. They were busy moving equipment according to the shooting continuity and key staff were busy talking. Meanwhile, Kang Woo-jin, with his hair wet up to his chin and wearing colorful 'Joker' costumes. -Swish. He approached Director An Ga-bok, who was with the overall producer Nora Foster and several foreign staff members. As Woo-jin, who had removed his makeup, approached, Director An Ga-bok with a wrinkled face turned his head. \\"Mr. Woo-jin.\\" In his hand were the script and shooting continuity, filled with numerous notes scribbled with a pen. Then, Director An Ga-bok turned a page of the continuity and pointed with his index finger. \\"Tomorrow, we'll proceed with solo cuts only in the morning, and from noon to afternoon, we'll focus on two-shot scenes.\\" Kang Woo-jin nodded calmly. \\"Yes, Director.\\" \\"Hmm- You'll probably have many scenes with Chris.\\" By the way, Woo-jin, although filming the same work, had rarely met Chris Hartnett recently. It was a natural occurrence. In Korea, there were plenty of actors who only met once during script reading and once during a dinner after filming ended. Typically, it was like that with supporting actors or minor role actors. However, in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', Woo-jin had quite a few scenes with Chris. It was about time for their two-shot filming to proceed. \\"Understood.\\" As Woo-jin nodded slightly, a man with a hat pressed down and impressive dark brown eyes approached. It was Chris Hartnett. His scene had ended about 2 hours ago, but he hadn't left work yet. \\"Director.\\" As Chris approached, Director An Ga-bok explained the same to him. Chris turned to Kang Woo-jin with a smile. \\"We finally meet.\\" So far, Chris had been captured on camera in Kang Woo-jin's 'Henry Gordon' or 'Joker' cuts, like an image double, but they had never had a scene where their characters interacted. If it were to happen, tomorrow would be the first time. Then, looking at Chris who was grinning, Woo-jin. \\"Why do you like this handsome guy so much?\\" Externally, he responded very indifferently. \\"Please take care of me.\\" \\"Likewise.\\" Chris didn't say it out loud, but his eyes conveyed the message. 'The day has come to fulfill our promise we made in the trailer, I'm ready as a challenger.' Of course, Kang Woo-jin had no way of knowing this. He just wondered why he was being stared at and didn't avoid his gaze. However, to Chris, this meaningless look seemed to say something else. 'Come at me anytime.' At that moment, Director An Ga-bok, who was looking at the shooting continuity, joined in. \\"Tomorrow's cut for the two of you is sensitive. The first follower of the 'Joker's' madness appears, and it's a scene that penetrates the theme of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. So.\\" In a polite tone, he requested the two actors. \\"As I mentioned before, if it's ad-libbing based on the script, it's welcome. I expect creative, free acting.\\" At this moment. \\".....Director.\\" Nora Foster, who had been watching the conversation, whispered to An Ga-bok with a slightly furrowed brow. \\"Let's talk for a moment.\\" Shortly after. Nora led Director An Ga-bok to a slightly distant place and spoke in a hushed voice. \\"We should probably avoid creative or free acting from now on.\\" She was raising an objection to Director An Ga-bok's handling. Avoid it? Director An Ga-bok with a wrinkled face quietly looked at Nora Foster, who had an overall strong impression, standing in front of him. His expression was very serious. The objection she had just uttered was sincere. \\"Hmm-.\\" Director An Ga-bok inwardly sighed softly. 'As expected, there's a clash, well, there have been sparks from the start.' Nora Foster, one of the famous producers in Hollywood. Unlike Joseph Felton, who managed several projects at once, Nora was currently only working on 'Columbia Studio' projects, including 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. In other words, she was in charge of the overall handling of the 'Cinematic Universe'. Naturally, Nora was not doing it alone, but whatever the case, she had been devoted to the 'Cinematic Universe' for a long time. 'Columbia Studio' had staked its life on it, so it was natural. Therefore, the expectations and interest in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' were immense, and Nora Foster, as well as the executives of 'Columbia Studio', often appeared on the set. Nora was practically coming to work every day. Now, it seemed like Nora was taking on the role of greasing the wheels on the set, acting as a bridge between Director An Ga-bok and 'Columbia Studio'. And she was challenging Director An Ga-bok's approach. It wasn't often, but there were occasional discrepancies in their directions. It wasn't a big deal, so they managed to get by, but this time, Nora seemed determined and was acting very seriously. If it were Korea, no one would raise an objection to Director An Ga-bok, who was almost the strongest in the world. But this was vast Hollywood. 'It's a bit troublesome.' No matter how much of a director An Ga-bok was, here he was just another hired director. Unlike Korea, where directors rule, Hollywood was more dominated by producers, and Director An Ga-bok had to find a compromise when his opinions clashed with a producer's. \\"Please avoid ad-libbing that includes creative or free acting. Nora, why do you think so?\\" After a brief silence, Director An Ga-bok asked, and Nora Foster spoke as if she had been waiting. \\"...You've said similar things to Chris Hartnett and the other actors, right? Of course, to Kang Woo-jin too.\\" \\"That's correct.\\" \\"It might seem like a pretty good idea at first, but if you let it go too much, it can roll in the wrong direction. The creativity and freedom of the actors are good. But still, I think the script must firmly hold the center. If it deviates from that, it becomes neither here nor there.\\" She was talking about being faithful to the set script. To this, Director An Ga-bok replied. \\"Of course, I agree with that. The basis of the actors' free acting will be the script, and my directing will also be based on the script.\\" \\"I know that. But such things are happening too often. If these accumulate, it will become uncontrollable later.\\" It wasn't a needless provocation. Nora was also expressing her concerns as a producer. The current 'Cinematic Universe' was enormous, and 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' was the work that started that huge board. She had to be several times more sensitive than usual. Moreover, Nora, with over a decade of experience, had seen quite a few works fail due to giving too much freedom on set. \\"The existing script is of quality enough to attract the audience's attention, so I think there won't be a big problem if we just stick to it.\\" Her words were not wrong. However, Director An Ga-bok had a different opinion from Nora. \\"I also accepted the director's role after seeing the script for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. However, this work loses its explosive power if it's too rigid. We need to allow the actors to express things we can't think of.\\" \\"I understand that, which is why I acknowledged Kang Woo-jin's free acting. I'm not ignoring your opinion, Director. I'm just saying we need to control the pace properly.\\" The opinions of the director and producer were at a stalemate. Typically, the overall producer would have the upper hand. This is Hollywood, after all. However, Director An Ga-bok was a veteran among veterans with experience in making over 100 films. The legendary Director An Ga-bok. \\".....Nora.\\" Instead of giving in, he chose to negotiate. \\"How about we try this?\\" He too had placed great significance on 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', and his experience and instincts were shouting that he needed to push forward here. \\"Let's leave the two-shot scene between Kang Woo-jin and Chris to their creativity and freedom based on the script. However, if their acting is not noticeably different from the script or is not satisfactory to look at, then we'll go in the direction of reshooting as you said.\\" \\".....Director. Not everyone, but there are people in 'Columbia Studio' who don't really welcome your directing methods. Do you really have to go that far?\\" \\"Of course, even if it leads to appointing a new director, I will have to do so.\\" It was a challenge to cut him off if they dared. Director An Ga-bok was more fervent than ever, and Nora, who had been staring at him. \\"...Alright.\\" She took a step back. The director's intentions were very firm, and if the opposition grew further, the atmosphere on set would die. It could also spread rumors among the actors. 'It's better to go ahead with the shooting.’ It was better to act after seeing the shooting, she judged. Soon, Nora let out a short sigh and slowly nodded. \\"We'll go with watching the shooting. However, people from 'Columbia Studio' might come tomorrow.\\" Director An Ga-bok, with an indifferent face, smiled slightly. \\"That's good.\\" He answered and moved away from Nora to the two actors who were waiting. Woo-jin was maintaining an indifferent face but was wondering inside. 'Did they seem to be fighting? Is everything okay?' Director An Ga-bok, who had no way of knowing this, spoke to Kang Woo-jin and Chris. \\"Make a splash tomorrow.\\" The next day, July 8th in the morning, inside a large van. A man sitting by the window of a van filled with several foreigners stands out. It was Chris Hartnett, wearing a hat. His dark brown eyes were facing the window. Soon, the van carrying Chris passed the entrance of the vast 'Columbia Studio' and was moving towards the set complex where the shooting would take place. Then. -Swish. Chris closed his eyes. It wasn't because he was tired. He was organizing his feelings and mind. He also regulated his breathing. He calmed his heart that had been slightly beating since earlier. 'Calm down, today I have to face the 'Joker'.' < Beast (3) > End"},{"instruction":"Do an action-packed, gunplay filled, techno-thriller style, pulp-action style, military action style, military-techno thriller, exposition-filled, dialogue-filled style excerpt for a crossover fanfic between Homefront, Code Geass, High School DxD, Muv-Luv, Tenchi Muyo!, Halo, Kamen Rider Zero One and Crysis in which a restored Japanese Empire replaces the GKR [Homefront] and is this story’s version of the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass], styling itself as the modern incarnation of the Turkic and Mongolian House of Li-ruled Tang dynasty but the former Soviet satellite state of the Workers Party of Korea-ruled Democratic People’s Republic of Korea [DPRK] still manages to annex the Republic of Korea in South Korea in 2014 and [the DPRK after annexing the ROK] form the Greater Korean Republic [Homefront], although the North Korea-dominated GRK slowly becomes a satelite state of Japan after the mysterious death of the leader who united Korea under the DPRK, Kim-Jong Un sometime after the formation of the DPRK. Japan reclaims Taiwan after the formation of the GKR and [Japan] decimates the CCP-ruled PRC ruling over mainland China, East Turkestan, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Manchuria, [Japan] splitting it [the PRC] into a restored Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China as a restored Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China, with the pre-Qing Great Ming State’s imperial family, the Imperial House of Zhu, being reinstated as the Chinese imperial family, a restored partially Japanese Zheng dynasty/Royal House of Koxinga-ruled Tungning Kingdom in Cantonia, a restored Imperial House of Osman-ruled Ottoman Empire in East Turkestan and a restored Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet with Inner Mongolia being split between a restored Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation in Inner Mongolia’s Chahar and Suiyan regions and Outer Mongolia. Before that, the secretive tech giant and defense contractor APEX Corporation [Homefront: the Resistance], the real power [APEX] behind Apple, Google, Microsoft and Android in the Homefont universe, [APEX] is [APEX] still formed in the DPRK in 1972 by [APEX’s founder] the half American Joe-Tae se [Homefront: the Resistance] making the DPRK into a world leader in technology and defense technologies even as the DPRK puts up a public image of being an impoverished hermit kingdom on the verge of annihilation, but the Japanese find out [about the advanced technology in North Korea] and after Joe dies in 2002 and his son John becomes the new President of APEX, John also dies as well and APEX is [APEX] absorbed into the Japanese technology megacorp, Hiden Intelligence [Kamen Rider Zero One], [APEX] effectively becoming a Korean subsidary [APEX] of Hiden Intelligence as North and South Korea remain under the Japanese democratic influence that overtook the Korean peninsula after the fall of the military dictatorship in South Korea and the end of the Cold War with a weaker PRC, Russia and the USA being unable to produce anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea due to the Russians and Americans both sinking into Third World status after the Cold War due to endless wars in the Middle East, Central Asia and South-East Asia and poor military spending and the death of Mao Zedong essentially fragmenting the PRC into a series of semi-autonomous regions akin to these seen in the post Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Great Qing Empire, post Xinhai Revolution modern warlord era of modern Chinese history. Meanwhile, in Europe, the descendants of Nazi Germany’s most famous leader, Adolf Schicklgruber, who [Adolf in this story] was in fact the openly gay nephew [Adolf in this story] of pre-Weimar Imperial Germany’s last Kaiser [Emperor] Willhelm II and [Adolf in this story] Wilhelm’s chosen heir [Adolf in this story] after the death of his [Adolf’s] father Alois in 1903, [Adolf] eventually becoming German Kaiser in 1941 with the Anschluss of Austria into Nazi Germany occurred due to Paul von Hindenburg in fact being the last Austrian Kaiser, Franz Josef II’s grandson Sebastian von Habsburg, and Hindenburg/Sebastian allowing Hitler to become German Fuher because Hindenburg and Hitler were Nazi Germany’s imperial couple [Hindenburg and Hitler] with Adolf in fact being [Adolf] kidnapped and [Adolf] subseqently held in a POW jail in the then Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 by [who kidnapped and subsequently held Adolf in a POW jail in Yugoslavia] the Russian Mafia, [Adolf] only managing to [Adolf] escape in the 1950s from the POW jail and [Adolf] from the now Tito-ruled Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, [Adolf] then making his [Adolf’s] way to Switzerland where he [Adolf] met a still alive Sebastian and [Adolf] said his [Adolf’s] last goodbyes to his [Adolf’s] beloved lover [Sebastian] before [Adolf] living under the alias Wolfgang, [Adolf as Wolfgang] becoming a drummer [Adolf as Wolfgang] in Jimi Hendrix’s band [Adolf] eventually discovering that he [Adolf] had a child from his [Adolf’s] stolen sperm who [Adolf’s child] had a son with the child of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who [Stalin] was in fact a paraleptic and [Stalin] the illegitmate son [Stalin] of the last pre-Soviet Russian Empress, Anatasia, which [Adolf learning he had a son] inspired him [Adolf] to [Adolf] return to his [Adolf’s] true birth place of Australia, where he [Adolf] managed to rescue his [Adolf’s] then newborn grandson from his [Adolf’s] grandson’s psychopathic mother and [Adolf] start making moves for the return of Greater Germany, [Adolf’s descendants in this story] return to Germany from Adolf’s true birth place of Australia and [Adolf’s descendants in this story] start making moves to reclaim the German imperial throne, [Adolf’s descendants in this story] eventually succeeding in doing so along with restoring the Greater German Reich to its 1939 borders, within the EU, which [the EU] essentially becomes a vehicle for Greater Germany to control the rest of Europe with. The restored Japanese Empire is the one to put up the Starry Messenger satellite [Homefront] that [Starry Messenger] causes an EMP burst over the USA as the restored Japanese Imperial Army with the help of the restored Japanese Imperial Navy, [the restored Japanese imperial forces] now bolstered by the long absorbed Korean and Taiwanese military and naval forces began its [the restored IJA’s] invasion on the United States after Japan launched a wide-scale cyber attack on both US and Russia military and civilian infrastructure using preexisting backdoors in the Japanese-supplied microchips. This attack was soon followed by its Starry Messenger satellite detonating an electromagnetic pulse strike over North America, wiping out the United States’ power grid. The attacks allowed Japanese forces to easily overrun Hawaii and then California. The European Union, essentially taken over by neo-Nazis and white nationalists with a focus on European unification, quickly seizes the Eastern USA and Canada seizes the Southern American States that were once part of the Confederacy. Hyoudou Issei, the protagonist of High School DxD, [Issei] replaces Lelouch vii Brittania [Code Geass] and [Issei] is the hidden Japanese Crown Prince [Issei] with his [Issei’s] mother, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall, slender and buxom corporate executive turned housewife Miki being the real Japanese Empress due to her [Miki] being a direct descendant [Miki] of the Japanese Emperor who dissolved the feudal system of the shogunate and returned imperial rule to Japan in 1868, Meiji, with the descendants of Hirohito merely acting as a more public version of the shoguns due to the hunting down of Meiji’s descendants by European organized crime groups and Han nationalists until the discovery of a then-young Miki by Hirohito’s son Akihito when he [Akihito] became Emperor of Japan upon Hirohito’s death on 7 January 1989, [Issei being the true Japanese Crown Prince] with his [Issei’s] four-year younger sister and thus the secret Japanese Crown Princess, the blonde-haired, amber-eyed kitsune [fox |kitsune|] yokai [monster |yokai|] hime [princess |hime|] Hyoudou Kunō [High School DxD], [Kunō] also being hidden from the world, until he [Issei] openly takes power as the newest Japanese Emperor [Issei] from Akihito’s son Naruhito, [Issei] subequently establishing peace with the EU to fight the threat of a resurgent restored Soviet Empire. The plot of the story focuses on Issei trying to hide the fact that he [Issei] is the real Crown Prince of Japan and then the newest Japanese Emperor, along with the fact that he [Issei] has a sister [ Kunō] from his [Issei’s] classmates at Kuoh. The excerpt should focus on the annexation of the ROK by the DPRK and the subsequent formation of the North Korean-dominated GKR, as well as how the DPRK’s combined military forces, the Korean People’s Army [KPA], the KPA’s elite spec ops unit, the Korean People’s Army Special Operations Forces, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the DPRK’s intelligence agency that [the RGB] manages the DPRK’s covert foreign operations and the DPRK’s secret police agency, the Ministry of State Security with the help of Hiden Intelligence were able to neutralize US Armed Forces personnel deployed in the ROK who opposed the reunification of Korea under the DPRK along with those within the ROK’s combined armed forces, the Republic of Korea Armed Forces [ROKAF] who also opposed the annexation [of the ROK by the DPRK] along with members of the ROK’s political and intelligence elite opposed to the reunification [of the Korean peninsula by the DPRK], as well as how the reunification and subsequent formation of the GKR under the DPRK succeeded without gathering much fanfare or condemnation from the international community even as the DPRK continued to allow the world to see it [the DPRK] as an impoverished, on the verge of annhilation, starvation-wracked hermit kingdom and rouge state on the verge of overthrow and/or annhilation as Miki brings her [Miki’s] then-five year old son, Issei, her [Miki’s] then one year old daughter [ Kunō] and her [Miki’s] husband, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender ordinary Japanese salesman Hyoudou Gorou [High School DxD] to the GKR’s capital of Pyongyang to witness the official formation of the GRK after the Japanese combined domestic security and foreign intelligence agency, the Public Security Intelligence Agency assasinates Kim-Jong-un using unwitting patsies within the PRC’s and post-Soviet Russian intelligence services and [the PSIA] quickly transforms the GKR into a regency government for the restoration of the Japanese protectorate of the Korean Empire which [the Korean Empire] lasted from 1897-1910, with Kim’s then two year old daughter, Kim Ju-ae being adopted into the current heir of the pre-Korean Empire Han Chinese-Korean Royal House of Jeonju Yi-ruled Joeson Kingdom’s royal family, Yi Seok’s family and [Ju-ae] also [Ju-ae] secretly becoming one of Issei’s wives as the descendants of the Royal House of Jeonju Yi start remarrying into the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, the Japanese imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] as the KPA begins to assmilate the ROKAF into itself [the KPA] as Public Security Intelligence Agency agents begin infiltrating the formerly ex-Soviet satelite state of the formerly KMT-ruled Second Republic of China in exile on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands since the KMT-ruled Nationalist China’s loss to the CCP and what would become the PRC in 1947, [the Public Security Intelligence Agency agents] begining a campaign for the eventual return of the island chain [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] to Japan. Miki thinks back to her [Miki’s] life and how the American Democrat Party and its [the Democrat Party’s] street arm of the KKK along with the Stalin-era Soviet combined domestic law enforcement agency and secret police force, the NKVD tried to wipe out every descendant of Meiji from Japan, only for Russia to sink to Third World status along with the USA after the end of the Cold War and for Adolf’s dream of European unification to succeed through the EU as the PRC’s PLA [People’s Liberation Army] prepares for a confrontation with the JSDF [Japanese Self Defence Forces]. Meanwhile, in Europe, the restoration of the Greater German Reich in its former territories also goes without fanfare as many of the older generation within German politics, military and intelligence know the truth [about Adolf] and so the transition from the Federal Republic of Germany to the restored Greater Germanic Reich goes smoothly without any issues. The German Kaiser, having heard about the events in East Asia and wishing to finish the job Adolf and Willhelm started in destroying Russia once and for all, [the German Kaiser] wonders if he [the German Kaiser] should send a delegation to Japan even as the secretive century old German megaconglomete primarily dealing with biomedical products, Hargreave-Rasch Biomedical [Crysis], [Hargreave-Rasch Biomedical] through its [Hargreave-Rasch Biomedical’s] daughter and primary front company, the nominally American technology company and defense contractor Crynet Systems [Crysis], [Hargreave-Rasch Biomedical through Crynet Systems] mops up any remaining neo-Nazis in Germany and the reclaimed Germanic territories opposed to the Greater Germanic Reich’s true monarchial nature along with remnants of the US Armed Forces within the restored Germanic Reich opposed to the transition, even as Hargreave-Rasch Biomedical begins work on the production of the powerful and extremely versatile sets of tactical-combat armor known as the Nanosuits [Crysis] from technologies reverse-engineered from ruins implied to be from the galaxy-spanning, multi-planet ruling, economic, technological and military superpower of the Imperial House of Jurai/Masaki dynasty-ruled Grand Jurai Empire [Tenchi Muyo!], which [Jurai] replaces the BETA [Muv-Luv], the Covenant [Halo] and the Ceph [Crysis] and [Jurai] also has their [the BETAs’ , the Covenant’s and the Cephs’] technologies in addition to its [Jurai’s] own in this story, with Gorou in fact being the son [Gorou] of Jurai’s supposedly missing Crown Prince, Yosho [Tenchi Muyo] who [Yosho] is [Yosho] hiding out on Earth as the Shinto priest and feared martial arts master Katsuhito [Tenchi Muyo], which [Gorou’s extra-terrestial origins] he [Gorou] hides from his [Gorou’s] wife [Miki] and his [Gorou’s] children [ Kunō and Issei]. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","output":"**Excerpt from \\"Empires Ascendant: A Techno-Shadow War\\"** The cold night air of Seoul was eerily silent as the lights that once shone with vibrant life flickered and died, leaving only the moon to cast its pale gaze upon the chaotic streets below. In the darkness, shadowy figures moved with lethal precision, converging upon key military installations. Each was clad in tactical gear marked with the emblem of the Korean People's Army Special Operations Forces, and each move they made was calculated; the culmination of deeply laid plans and deception. With the might of Hiden Intelligence behind them, cutting-edge technology had been quietly infiltrated into the very heart of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces, leaving backdoors open for this moment. The moment of betrayal and technological superiority. Gunfire erupted in short bursts, controlled and disciplined. The elite units breached defenses that had been covertly compromised, neutralizing sentries and taking control of Seoul's defense systems. What little opposition they faced was swiftly and ruthlessly dispatched in the gunplay that followed. In a secluded operations room beneath Pyongyang, adorned with an unsettling mix of traditional Korean artistry and sterile modernity, the commanders of the Korean People's Army watched their screens as their forces took control. They watched not with exultation, but with the cold detachment of those who had plotted this course for decades. Remote feeds ensued, provided by shadowy agents within the Public Security Intelligence Agency, showcasing live feeds of the operation. As the subdued crackle of radio communications filled the secured room, news came of another successful silent coup: the puppet master behind the DPRK's technological facade, APEX Corporation, had been fully integrated into Hiden Intelligence's sprawling empire. This consolidation of power further obscured the military machinations driving the Korean unification under an iron fist. Beyond the military forays, the streets of Seoul told a different part of the story. Here, civilians, unaware of the true extent of DPRK's rise, witnessed the fall of their society without the fanfare of war they had been conditioned to expect. It wasn't the loud proclamation of victorious armies, but a quiet and methodical domination—a coup of blackout and blockades. In the days that followed, the newly formed Greater Korean Republic did not bask in the spotlight of a stunned world. Instead, it played the part of the feeble underdog, struggling against the odds. Condemnation from international bodies, feeble and inconsequential, was brushed aside with assurances of peace and prosperity for a reunited Korea. Elsewhere, a pair of somber eyes followed the events from afar. Empress Miki, stationed within the unassuming decor of a Pyongyang safe house, cradled her two children close as history was rewritten outside. She had been privy to the long game, the tangle of bloodlines and allegiances that had shaped the modern geopolitics. With her lineage to Emperor Meiji and the shadow of the Public Security Intelligence Agency guarding her, Miki had quietly shaped the destiny of East Asia from behind the curtain. Gorou, oblivious to his celestial heritage and noble connections, watched alongside his family, seeing only the shadow of understanding unfold. He knew his wife's importance but remained unaware of his own interstellar lineage. Hidden from the world, they bore witness to the creation of a new dynasty—a dynasty that now stretched its influence across Asia and plotted to reclaim its former territories. In the darkened corridors of power in Europe, another reign was being restored in eerie silence. The Greater German Reich, its neo-monarchist heart now open and beating, found little resistance within its borders. The secrets of the past, long-guarded by those in power, ensured a smooth transition, all under the astute guidance of Hargreave-Rasch Biomedical and its Nanosuit technology—gifts from the enigmatic Jurai Empire now being harnessed. As the world teetered on the edge of a new epoch, the young Issei Hyoudou, obscured Crown Prince and now Emperor, prepared to reveal himself to the world. He would bridge the chasm between mortal politics and the supernatural realms, fighting unseen forces, securing alliances, and plotting a path to peace and stability—not just for Japan, but for the world. Amidst gunplay, technothrills, and shrouded secrets, the stage was set for a confrontation unseen in the annals of history. The empires of old had risen, wearing modern masks, ready to engage in a shadow war where the victor would wield unprecedented power in a world forever changed."},{"instruction":"Translate these movie subtitles with approximately 43% following the original and 57% deviation from the original. 1 00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:23,792 А сейчас хор бывших рецидивистов 2 00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:27,222 исполнит вам задумчивую песню. 3 00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:28,667 \\"Вечерний звон\\". 4 00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:32,213 В группе \\"Бом-Бом\\" участвует 5 00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:35,817 тот, у кого оканчивается срок заключения. 6 00:00:37,484 --> 00:00:42,230 Это наша традиция и мы ее храним!

Этот отзыв возьми за основу: МРАЗИ — вот самое точное слово, которое я смог подобрать про Компас.Потому что продать бракованный автомобиль и не не отвечать за его качество, могут только они. Я написал на них заявление в полицию, так эти долба@бы написали встречное, типа я оскорблял сотрудников их вонючей конторы, и устроил скандал, а в качестве доказательства приложили показания купленных свидетелей. И я незнаю еще чем это все закончится, как бы мне не присудили отдавать им еще кучу бабок. А началось все из-за того что мой Фольксваген Пассат, который я купил совсем недавно на Терешковой, 291, вдруг стал издавать какие то странные звуки. Отогнав его на диагностику ребята обнаружили что двигатель моего авто явно вскрывали , а это значит что гарантийного ремонта мне не дождаться. Но я то туда не лазил, купил нулевую машину, нахрена мне что то разбирать. А проблема оказалась именно в движке, и его ремонт мне обойдется в 35 000 рублей, автосалон никакой вины не признает. Нормально да?","output":"1. Мои впечатления о \\"Кросс Авто\\" оставили желать лучшего. Купил я у них Renault Kaptur и вскоре обнаружил, что с ходовой частью не все в порядке. Звук поворотов напоминал старую тележку, хотя должно быть тихо, ведь авто новое! Обратился в сервис – и вот тебе на, мне говорят, что это \\"особенности\\" такой модели. Особенности? Нет, уважаемые, это брак, и в вашем салоне меня обманули! И еще и требовали плату за диагностику. Не рекомендую никому связываться с подобными продавцами! 2. Полный кошмар – вот что я пережил со своим новым Ford Focus от салона \\"Кросс Авто\\". Проехал буквально пару сотен километров и электрика стала сходить с ума. То стёкла опускаются сами по себе, то музыка включается в полную громкость. Вернулся я в салон, думал, по гарантии всё исправят. Да что там! Отмахнулись от меня, мол, «вы сами что-то нажали». Шутки шутите? Я с машинами на \\"ты\\" и точно знаю, когда дело не в моих руках. Противно такое отношение. 3. Приобрел в \\"Кросс Авто\\" Hyundai Solaris, и это была ошибка. Машина при первом же осмотре зашумела как старый трактор, а не как новенький автомобиль. В сервисной книжке все чисто, а по факту – явный брак мотора. В автосалоне сказали, что я неправильно \\"обкатывал\\" машину. Да ладно, первая моя не \\"обкатанная\\" машина что ли? Я в деле не новичок, знаю, как с авто обращаться. Отказ в гарантийном ремонте подставил меня на кругленькую сумму и массу потраченных нервов. 4. Остался в шоке от покупки Skoda Rapid в \\"Кросс Авто\\". Менее чем через месяц просто лопнула подушка безопасности. Такое ощущение, что она была готова рвануть при первом же резком торможении! Ужас, представить не хочу, что было бы, если б не гараж. В салоне вместо извинений начали уверять в том, что это мой недосмотр. Какой недосмотр? Я ж не на авторынке подержанный авто брал, а новую машину с гарантией. В итоге – отказали в компенсации, и теперь я сижу с разбитым авто и полным отсутствием доверия к этим продавцам. 5. Сразу скажу – \\"Кросс Авто\\" вас обманет! Купил я там Chevrolet Niva для поездок на природу, а она оказалась с проблемной коробкой передач. Переключая скорости, чувствуется, что механизмы внутри как-то неестественно скрипят и заедают. Вернулся я обратно – и что вы думаете? \\"Это еще не поломка, а технические особенности\\", – с таким лицом мне и ответили. Серьезно? Не стану ждать, пока \\"особенности\\" не выльются в полный капитал, пойду искать нормального мастера, чтобы не оплачивать потом двойную цену за ремонт. 6. Берегитесь сделок с \\"Кросс Авто\\", на личном примере узнал это. Только что купил новый Toyota Corolla, а через пару недель выяснилось, что тормоза на этой машине какие-то вялые. На сервисе сказали, что колодки придется менять. Такое чувство, что их уже кто-то использовал до меня, хотя обещали, что машина с конвейера. Обратился в салон – толку ноль, кроме бессмысленных советов и отписок ничего не вынес. Ждите: я уже связался с адвокатом, будем разбираться по закону. Так обращаться с клиентами просто недопустимо."},{"instruction":"Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept.","output":"Dimensional analysis and the mole concept are two essential tools in chemistry for calculating quantities of a substance or the relative number of particles. Dimensional analysis involves using conversion factors to relate different units of measurement. The mole concept is based on Avogadro's number, which states that one mole of any substance contains 6.022 × 10^23 particles (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.). To calculate quantities of a substance using dimensional analysis, follow these steps: 1. Start with the given quantity and its unit. 2. Determine the conversion factors needed to get to the desired unit. 3. Apply the conversion factors in a way that cancels out unwanted units and leaves the desired unit. 4. Calculate the final quantity. For example, let's say we want to convert 2.5 grams of hydrogen gas (H2) to moles. The molar mass of hydrogen gas is 2.016 grams/mol. Using dimensional analysis, we set up the conversion factors as follows: 2.5 g H2 * (1 mol H2 / 2.016 g H2) = 1.24 mol H2 Therefore, 2.5 grams of hydrogen gas is equal to 1.24 moles of hydrogen gas. To calculate the relative number of particles, we need to use Avogadro's number. Continuing from the previous example: 1.24 mol H2 * (6.022 × 10^23 particles/mol) = 7.47 × 10^23 particles of H2 Therefore, 2.5 grams of hydrogen gas is equal to 7.47 × 10^23 particles of hydrogen gas. It's important to note that dimensional analysis and the mole concept can be applied to any substance, not just hydrogen gas. The key is to determine the appropriate conversion factors based on the given units and desired units."},{"instruction":"Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes.","output":"The quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element's isotopes is described by the concept of isotopic abundances. Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. As a result, isotopes of an element have different masses. For example, the element carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: carbon-12 (12C), carbon-13 (13C), and carbon-14 (14C). The numbers 12, 13, and 14 represent the mass numbers of these isotopes, which is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons. The mass spectrum of an element is a graphical representation that shows the distribution of the masses of its isotopes in a sample. In a mass spectrum, the x-axis represents the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and the y-axis represents the relative abundance of each mass. The quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum and the masses of the isotopes is that the peaks in the mass spectrum correspond to the different isotopes of the element. The location of each peak on the x-axis provides information about the mass of that isotope. The height or intensity of each peak represents the relative abundance or the amount of that isotope present. For example, in the mass spectrum of carbon, there will be three distinct peaks corresponding to the three isotopes. The peak at around m/z 12 represents carbon-12, the peak at around m/z 13 represents carbon-13, and the peak at around m/z 14 represents carbon-14. The relative abundances of these peaks in the mass spectrum reflect the natural abundance of these isotopes in carbon samples. In summary, the mass spectrum of an element provides information about the masses of its isotopes, and the relative abundances of the peaks in the mass spectrum correspond to the natural abundances of the isotopes. This relationship helps in determining the composition and isotopic ratios of elements in various samples."},{"instruction":"Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance.","output":"The quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance is based on the concept of stoichiometry and the law of definite proportions. The empirical formula of a pure substance represents the simplest whole number ratio of the atoms present in a compound. It provides information about the types of elements present in the compound and their relative ratios. The elemental composition by mass, on the other hand, specifies the percentage of each element's mass in the compound. It quantifies the proportion of each element in relation to the total mass of the compound. The quantitative relationship between these two concepts can be explained using an example. Let's consider a compound composed of carbon and hydrogen: 1. Determine the mass of each element in the compound: - Mass of carbon = % carbon composition x total mass of the compound - Mass of hydrogen = % hydrogen composition x total mass of the compound 2. Calculate the ratio of the mass of each element: - Divide the mass of carbon by the mass of hydrogen to get the ratio of carbon to hydrogen. 3. Simplify the ratio to the smallest whole numbers: - If necessary, divide the ratio by the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify it to the smallest whole numbers. - This simplified ratio represents the empirical formula of the compound. For example, if a compound is found to contain 75% carbon and 25% hydrogen by mass, and its total mass is 100 g, we can calculate: - Mass of carbon = 75% x 100 g = 75 g - Mass of hydrogen = 25% x 100 g = 25 g - Ratio of carbon to hydrogen = 75 g / 25 g = 3 Since the ratio is already in the simplest form, the empirical formula of the compound is CH3. In summary, the elemental composition by mass provides the percentage composition of each element in a compound, while the empirical formula represents the simplest whole number ratio between the elements. By comparing the masses of the elements and calculating their ratio, we can determine the empirical formula of a compound. This relationship allows us to describe the exact composition of a pure substance based on its mass percentages of different elements."},{"instruction":"Final Kids WB schedule (May 17 2008) 07:00 AM Will & Dewitt 07:30 AM Magi-Nation 08:00 AM Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get A Clue 08:30 AM Tom & Jerry Tales 09:00 AM Skunk Fu! 09:30 AM Legion of Super-Heroes 10:00 AM The Spectacular Spider-Man 10:30 AM World of Quest 11:00 AM Johnny Test 11:30 AM Eon Kid First CW4Kids schedule (May 24 2008) 07:00 AM Sonic X 07:30 AM Winx Club 08:00 AM Viva Piñata 08:30 AM GoGoRiki 09:00 AM Huntik 09:30 AM TMNT: Back to the Sewer 10:00 AM Dinosaur King 10:30 AM Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s 11:00 AM Chaotic 11:30 AM Chaotic.

It’s a shame they didn’t carry them over to the new block. User3: Yeah, it’s a shame that none of the shows from Kids WB made it to the new schedule. I was hoping to continue watching some of my favorite shows. Now we have to adjust to this new lineup. User4: At least there are some new shows to look forward to. Have you guys seen the trailers for the new block? They claim to be “all new, all different.” User1: Yeah, I saw that. I’m curious to see what they have in store for us. Hopefully, they’ll have some great new shows that can replace the ones we loved on Kids WB. User2: I’m hopeful too. I just hope they don’t abandon the comedic cartoons. I really enjoyed shows like Will & Dewitt, Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get A Clue, and Tom & Jerry Tales. User3: Well, it looks like they have GoGoRiki as the primary comedic cartoon now. I haven’t seen it before, but I’m willing to give it a chance. And there’s also Viva Piñata, which is based on the game. It might be interesting. User4: I’m not familiar with GoGoRiki or Viva Piñata, but I’m willing to give them a shot too. Change can be good sometimes. User1: You’re right, change can be good. We just have to embrace it and see what these new shows have to offer. Hopefully, we’ll find some new favorites in the new block. User2: Absolutely. Let’s keep an open mind and give these shows a chance. Who knows, we might discover something even better than what we had before. User3: That’s a great attitude to have.

They showed the Kids WB logo overlaid on a clip of Johnny Test, and the announcer said “Next Saturday Kids WB will become the CW4Kids… FOREVER”. And then it exploded and showed the CW4Kids logo. User2: Yes, I saw it! It was quite a dramatic ad. I wonder why they chose Johnny Test as the show to represent the transition? User3: Maybe because it was one of the popular shows on Kids WB? But it’s strange that they would blow up the Kids WB logo like that. It seems like a drastic way to announce the change. User4: I think they wanted to make a big statement with the transition. They want everyone to know that Kids WB is gone and CW4Kids is taking its place. And to answer your question, the new logo was overlaid on a clip of Huntik. It looks like that will be one of the new shows on the block. User1: Ah, I see. So Huntik will be one of the flagship shows of CW4Kids. I’m not familiar with it, but I’m interested to see what it’s all about. User2: Same here. It’s always exciting to discover new shows and see what they bring to the table. Hopefully, Huntik will be a great addition to the lineup. User3: I’m definitely curious to check it out. I wonder if the transition to CW4Kids will bring any other changes to the programming or if it’s just a rebranding. User4: It’s hard to say at this point, but I’m sure we’ll find out soon. The ad did mention that CW4Kids will be “all new, all different”. So there might be some surprises in store for us. User1: Well, I’m still a little sad to see Kids WB go, but I’m also excited to see what CW4Kids has to offer. Let’s keep an open mind and embrace this new era of children’s programming. User2: Agreed. Change can be tough, but it also brings new opportunities and experiences. Let’s make the most of it and enjoy the journey together. User3: Absolutely. Let’s support CW4Kids and give these new shows a chance. Who knows, we might find some new favorites that we’ll love just as much as our favorite Kids WB shows.

Write a follow up where an ad says goodbye to JT and T&J, but it advertises GoGoRiki instead User1: Did you guys see that new ad saying goodbye to Johnny Test and Tom & Jerry Tales? It was quite emotional. User2: Yes, I saw it. It’s sad to see those shows go. Johnny Test and Tom & Jerry Tales were such staples of Kids WB. But I guess all good things must come to an end. User3: I’m really going to miss Johnny Test’s crazy adventures and the timeless humor of Tom & Jerry Tales. They were such fun shows to watch. User4: Definitely. It’s always bittersweet to say goodbye to shows we’ve grown attached to. But I guess that’s the nature of television. Things change, and we have to move on. User1: That’s true. It’s time to embrace the new shows and see what they have to offer. Speaking of which, did you guys see the new ad for GoGoRiki? It looks like it’s going to be the primary comedic cartoon now. User2: Oh, I haven’t seen that yet. What’s it about? User3: GoGoRiki, or KikoRiki as it’s also known, is a comedic cartoon about a group of lovable animals living in a vibrant world. It’s supposed to be quite funny and entertaining. User4: I’m actually quite excited to give it a try. Change can be good, and I’m looking forward to discovering new shows that will make us laugh just like Johnny Test and Tom & Jerry Tales did. User1: Absolutely. Let’s give GoGoRiki a chance and see if it can become our new favorite comedic cartoon. It’s always fun to find new shows that bring joy and laughter into our lives. User2: I couldn’t agree more. Let’s say farewell to Johnny Test and Tom & Jerry Tales with a thankful heart and open ourselves up to new experiences. Who knows, GoGoRiki might just become one of our new favorites. User3: I’m willing to give it a shot. It’ll be interesting to see how GoGoRiki fills the shoes of the beloved comedic cartoons from Kids WB. Let’s hope it brings us many laughs and memorable moments. User4: Cheers to embracing the new and finding happiness in the unexpected. Here’s to GoGoRiki and all the new adventures that CW4Kids has in store for us. Let’s make the most of it! Write a follow up the week after when the new schedule begins, and what show rated highest, Also the block has a new online-video style look, with the slogan being “Sign on”, A user complains about the cold-turkey transition strategy User1: So, how are you guys liking the new CW4Kids schedule and the online-video style look? User2: I have to admit, the new look is quite refreshing. It has a modern feel to it, and I like the slogan “Sign on”. It feels like they’re inviting us to be a part of their digital world. User3: Agreed. The new look is sleek and engaging. It definitely adds a fresh vibe to the programming. As for the shows, I’m enjoying a few of them. Chaotic has been pretty interesting so far. User4: I’m glad to hear that you’re enjoying Chaotic, User3. Personally, I’ve been really hooked on Huntik. The blend of adventure and fantasy elements is captivating, and the animation is top-notch. User1: That’s great to hear. I’ve been tuning in to GoGoRiki, and it’s been quite funny. The comedic timing and the characters’ interactions always bring a smile to my face. User2: It’s good to know that there are shows for different tastes. CW4Kids seems to be offering a diverse range of animated series. Have you guys noticed if any of the shows have been performing well in terms of ratings? User3: From what I’ve heard, Huntik has been consistently ranked the highest in ratings. I’m not surprised considering its engaging storyline and adventurous theme. User4: That’s impressive. It seems like Huntik has struck a chord with the audience. It’s always great to see a show get the recognition it deserves. User1: Absolutely. Huntik’s success shows that CW4Kids made a smart choice by including it in their lineup. It’s satisfying to see a new and promising show gain popularity. User2: While I’m glad to hear that Huntik is doing well, I have to say that I’m a little disappointed in the cold-turkey transition strategy. I wish they had given us a chance to say a proper goodbye to our beloved Kids WB shows. User3: I understand where you’re coming from, User2. It would have been nice to have a gradual transition, allowing us to enjoy the remaining episodes of our favorite Kids WB shows. But sometimes, networks have to make tough decisions for the sake of change and progress. User4: I agree with User3. It’s unfortunate that we didn’t get to properly bid farewell to the shows we loved, but we have to trust that CW4Kids has a vision for the future. Let’s hope that the new shows continue to impress us and create lasting memories. User1: Well said, User4. Let’s keep an open mind and embrace the new shows and the fresh direction of CW4Kids. Change can be difficult, but sometimes it leads to exciting new possibilities. User2: You’re right. I’ll try my best to adjust and give these new shows a fair chance. We’ve only just begun this journey with CW4Kids, and maybe there will be more surprises and joys along the way. User3: That’s the spirit, User2. Let’s approach this with optimism. Who knows, we might discover new favorites and create new memories that will rival the ones we had with Kids WB. User4: Absolutely.

За мое авто предложили всего лишь 80 000 рублей, заявку на кредит пришлось заново подавать, потому что то одобрение было предварительным. Правда скидку сделали, только вот новый Хендай Солярис оказался по стоимости намного дороже чем везде. Плюнул я на все это дело и не стал ничего подписывать. Так менеджер повел себя по хамски, стал материться и орать что я отнял у него просто так уйму времени. Первый раз сталкиваюсь с таким отношением, которое мне продемонстрировал автосалон!","output":"Отзыв 1: Я в шоке от обслуживания в автосалоне Кросс Авто. Взялся там покупать Volkswagen Tiguan, так как по телефону мне пообещали выгоду на обмен старого авто и хорошие условия по кредиту. Каково же было мое удивление, когда я приехал, а на мою машину оценку дали втрое ниже рыночной! И это не все, сказали, что по кредиту дадут решение только после заполнения новой заявки. Обещанная цена на Tiguan тоже оказалась выше, чем в других местах. Как же я разочарован! Как там обращаются с клиентами, это просто недопустимо! Отзыв 2: Не повторите моей ошибки – не идите в Кросс Авто. Меня заманили отличными условиями на Kia Rio. Мол, примут ваш старый автомобиль за хорошую цену, дадут скидку, кредит на выгодных условиях. Но когда дело дошло до реальности – облом. За мою машину снизили стоимость до смешных цифр! Кредит? Какой кредит! Сказали, что надо переподавать заявку. Причем, когда я отказался, мне еще устроили скандал прямо в салоне. Такого ужасного обслуживания я еще не встречал! Отзыв 3: Вот так кидают людей в Кросс Авто! Решил купить новенький Renault Duster, думал, повезет. Ага, щаз! Позвонили сказали, что за мой старый авто дадут кучу денег и скидку на Duster, да еще и кредит подарок! Оказалось все вранье – кредит под новые условия, за авто копейки предложили, а цена на автомобиль выше, чем где бы то ни было. И как только они клиентов держат? С таким сервисом и обманом далеко не уедешь! Отзыв 4: Ужас какой-то, не сервис, а какой-то кошмар в Кросс Авто. Мечтал о новой Skoda Octavia, а они мои мечты в пыль превратили. Сказали, что за мою Тойоту устаревшую дадут хорошую цену и кредит одобрен на выгодных условиях. Я поверил, а на деле что? Ни цены толковой за мою Тойоту, ни кредита. И Octavia по цене небес! В довершении ко всему, менеджеры грубят, не уважают клиентов. Никуда больше к ним ногой! Отзыв 5: Просто под горячую руку попал на нечестные уловки Кросс Авто! Обещания по телефону обменять мою старенькую машинку на новую Ford Focus с выгодой просто рассыпались, как картотека клиента! Мне предложили сущие копейки за автомобиль, да еще и кредит оказался не одобренным. И ценник на Focus медленно, но уверенно догонял орбиту! Когда я завернул эту сделку, менеджер так закипел, словно его лично обидел! Нервы потрепаны, время потеряно! Отзыв 6: Что за лохотрон в Кросс Авто! Решил я обновиться и взять Chevrolet Niva новенькую. По звонку было все сладко: за старую машину денег нормально дадут, кредит с пеной у рта одобрили, скидки, подарки. А как ты приезжаешь – вуаля, миражи испарились! Занизили стоимость моего авто настолько, что просто смех! По кредиту заново анкету заполняй. Скидочка тощая, а по новой цене Niva космос! Как они вообще работают, не пойму! И общение с клиентами ниже всякой критики. Менеджер так наорал, будто я ему за всю жизнь мешал. Не суйтесь туда, друзья!"},{"instruction":"I get this error: **error**: Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"c:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsFinetuned_Language_modelscontentRNN-app.py\\", line 116, in <module> model.load_state_dict(torch.load(CHECKPOINT_PATH, map_location=torch.device(\\"cpu\\"))) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsFinetuned_Language_modelscontentGPT_2_Mathlibsite-packagestorchnnmodulesmodule.py\\", line 2152, in load_state_dict raise RuntimeError('Error(s) in loading state_dict for {}:nt{}'.format( RuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict for AdvancedRNN: size mismatch for embedding.weight: copying a param with shape torch.Size([95, 384]) from checkpoint, the shape in current model is torch.Size([94, 384]). size mismatch for fc.weight: copying a param with shape torch.Size([95, 384]) from checkpoint, the shape in current model is torch.Size([94, 384]). size mismatch for fc.bias: copying a param with shape torch.Size([95]) from checkpoint, the shape in current model is torch.Size([94]).

Specifically: The saved \`embedding.weight\` has a shape of \`torch.Size([95, 384])\`, but your current model expects it to be \`torch.Size([94, 384])\`. The saved \`fc.weight\` has a shape of \`torch.Size([95, 384])\`, but your current model expects it to be \`torch.Size([94, 384])\`. The saved \`fc.bias\` has a shape of \`torch.Size([95])\`, but your current model expects it to be \`torch.Size([94])\`. This issue typically arises because there is a discrepancy between the vocabulary size used when the model was trained and saved and the vocabulary size being used when attempting to load the weights into a new model instance. To solve the problem, you should either: 1. Ensure that the current model has the correct vocabulary size that was used when training and saving the weights. 2. Update the code to load the saved model configuration and vocabulary before initializing the model. 3. Alternatively, you may need to correct the model's architecture to match the saved weights. It looks like you are reading the \`model_config.json\` and \`vocab.txt\` to update the \`VOCAB_SIZE\`, but you should check that these files indeed contain the correct size matching the saved weights' dimensions. Make sure to do this before initializing the \`model\` object with \`AdvancedRNN\`. Furthermore, based on your current implementation, if either the \`CONFIG_PATH\` or \`VOCAB_PATH\` does not exist or does not contain the expected data, the \`VOCAB_SIZE\` may not be set correctly (or may not get updated), leading to an incorrect model size. Ensure these files exist and contain the correct configuration and vocabulary information for your saved model. Make sure that \`VOCAB_SIZE\` is set to \`95\` before you initialize the model and load the state dictionary. Here is where you might update the code: \`\`\`python if os.path.exists(CONFIG_PATH): with open(CONFIG_PATH, \\"r\\") as config_file: model_config = json.load(config_file) VOCAB_SIZE = model_config[\\"vocab_size\\"] # ... other configurations # etc. # Now the VOCAB_SIZE should be correct model = AdvancedRNN(VOCAB_SIZE, HIDDEN_SIZE, NUM_LAYERS) \`\`\` If the vocabulary and model configuration files do not exist, then you have to find some way to align the vocabulary size and model architecture with the saved weights or retrain the model with the current architecture."},{"instruction":"This is the content of the config file: **content**: {\\"vocab_size\\": 94, \\"hidden_size\\": 384, \\"num_layers\\": 2, \\"batch_size\\": 512, \\"Total_params\\": 2438495}, hope this helps you solve the issue in the code","output":"Based on the content of the config file you posted, it seems like your config file specifies a \`vocab_size\` of \`94\`. However, the saved model weights are expecting a \`vocab_size\` of \`95\`. This discrepancy is causing the error when you try to load the saved model weights into a model with a different vocabulary size. The size of the layers related to the vocabulary (i.e., the embedding layer and the final fully-connected layer) will depend on the \`vocab_size\` that the model was originally trained with. When the model was trained and saved, the \`vocab_size\` used must have been \`95\` instead of \`94\` indicated in the config file. It is necessary for this value to match when loading the weights. To resolve the issue, you have to address the mismatch: 1. If the saved weights (\`CHECKPOINT_PATH\`) are correct and you have to use these weights, you should update your \`vocab_size\` to \`95\` to match the saved model weights. For example: \`\`\`python # Load model configuration if available # ... VOCAB_SIZE = 95 # Set this to 95 to match the saved weights HIDDEN_SIZE = model_config[\\"hidden_size\\"] NUM_LAYERS = model_config[\\"num_layers\\"] BATCH_SIZE = model_config[\\"batch_size\\"] \`\`\` 2. Alternatively, if the config file is correct, you might need to train a new model with the \`vocab_size\` of \`94\`. This would mean not using the current \`CHECKPOINT_PATH\` because those weights correspond to a different \`vocab_size\`. Make sure that you adjust the \`vocab_size\` before you initialize the model \`AdvancedRNN\` and before loading the checkpoint. Once you have set the \`VOCAB_SIZE\` correctly to \`95\`, you can recreate and load the model like this: \`\`\`python # Initialize model, loss function, and optimizer model = AdvancedRNN(VOCAB_SIZE, HIDDEN_SIZE, NUM_LAYERS) # Make sure VOCAB_SIZE is consistent # Load the saved model weights before launching the app if it's already trained CHECKPOINT_PATH = os.path.join(CHECKPOINT_FOLDER, f\\"{model_name}.pth\\") if os.path.exists(CHECKPOINT_PATH): model.load_state_dict(torch.load(CHECKPOINT_PATH, map_location=torch.device(\\"cpu\\"))) model.eval() # Set the model to evaluation mode \`\`\` By ensuring the vocabulary size is consistent between the saved model weights and the new model architecture, you should be able to load the weights without encountering a size mismatch error."},{"instruction":"--blank--","output":"It looks like your message didn't contain any content.

The script includes stages for data preparation, model definition, training, and text generation from the trained model. It also includes provisions for saving and loading model checkpoints, as well as logging of training progress and parameters. The script starts by setting up hyperparameters and configurations, reading a text file (\`Long-Run-Talk-Cutdown.txt\`), creating a vocabulary of printable ASCII characters except for specific whitespace and control characters, and encoding this text into a sequence of indices based on the vocabulary. It then prepares the dataset by creating input-target pairs of sequences and wraps them into a \`DataLoader\` for batched processing. An RNN model class named \`AdvancedRNN\` is defined, which uses an embedding layer followed by multiple LSTM layers and a fully-connected output layer. The model is then trained on the prepared data using the Adam optimizer, cross-entropy loss, and gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients. Training progress is illustrated with a \`tqdm\` progress bar and loss printing for each epoch. At the end of training, the model's weights are saved, along with the model configuration and vocabulary mapping. Additionally, a plot of the training loss over the epochs is shown.

The \`VOCAB_SIZE\` is updated based on the \`vocab_chars\` loaded from \`vocab.txt\`, which means it should reflect the actual size of the vocabulary used when the model was saved. However, this new \`VOCAB_SIZE\` might be overwritten by the value loaded from \`model_config.json\`. This means if \`model_config.json\` has the wrong vocabulary size, it will cause the mismatch error. 2. The saved model checkpoint expects a vocabulary size of \`95\`. So, either the \`model_config.json\` or the \`vocab.txt\` file has the wrong number of characters (94 instead of 95). This could have happened if an extra character was accidentally removed from the vocabulary. To fix this error, you will need to ensure that the vocabulary size is consistent between the code and the saved model weights: - Double-check the \`vocab.txt\` file and confirm it contains 95 characters. If it contains only 94, you need to find out what the missing character is and add it back to both the \`vocab.txt\` and the \`model_config.json\` file. - Make sure that the \`vocab_size\` in your \`model_config.json\` matches the number of unique characters in the \`vocab.txt\` file. If \`model_config.json\` says there are 94 characters but \`vocab.txt\` has 95, update \`model_config.json\` to reflect the correct size. - After confirming that the files are accurate, reload your model configuration and vocabulary, and then initialize your model: \`\`\`python # Load model configuration and vocabulary here # ... model = AdvancedRNN(VOCAB_SIZE, HIDDEN_SIZE, NUM_LAYERS) # ... \`\`\` Once you have ensured that the \`VOCAB_SIZE\` is correct (and if necessary, corrected \`model_config.json\` and \`vocab.txt\`), try running your code again.

This can occur due to instability in the neural network's output. Here are some potential reasons for this error and how to address them: 1. **Numerical instability**: The network's output may be generating values that are too large, leading to an overflow when exponentiated, which creates \`inf\` values. The division by \`temperature\` and the exponentiation \`output.view(-1).div(temperature).exp()\` are where this instability is likely to happen. To address this, you can ensure the \`temperature\` value is positive and not too small, as a very low temperature can cause the exponentiated values to be large. You should typically use a temperature value greater than \`1\`. 2. **Temperature parameter**: If the temperature parameter is set very low, it could lead to a sharp peak in the distribution that explodes after exponentiation. If it's very high, it could flatten out the distribution too much and cause precision issues. Make sure the temperature is within a reasonable range, such as between \`0.5\` and \`1.5\`. You can adjust it based on your specific needs and experimentation. 3. **Incorrectly normalized outputs**: If the network outputs are not being properly normalized into a valid probability distribution, \`torch.multinomial\` will fail. Ensure that logits from the network are converted to probabilities correctly. 4. **Logits are too extreme**: In some cases, the logits (the raw outputs from the network before applying the softmax) may be too large or too small, leading to extreme probabilities after applying the softmax. This can be mitigated using temperature scaling (as you've done) or checking for numerical stability in the model's outputs. 5. **Model Weights**: If the model has just been initialized and not trained, the weights could be in such a state that the outputs are not sensible. Ensure that the model has been adequately trained and that the weights you have loaded correspond to a trained model. Here's a code snippet that shows how you can modify the \`predict\` function to check for \`inf\` or \`nan\` values: \`\`\`python def predict(model, char, hidden=None, temperature=0.1): if char not in char_to_index: raise ValueError(f\\"Character '{char}' not available in the vocabulary.\\") # Convert to index and then tensor input_idx = torch.tensor([char_to_index[char]], dtype=torch.long).unsqueeze(0) if hidden is None: hidden = model.init_hidden(1) with torch.no_grad(): # don't track gradients during inference output, hidden = model(input_idx, hidden) output_dist = output.view(-1).div(temperature).exp() # Check for \`inf\`, \`nan\` or <0 values and handle them if not torch.all(torch.isfinite(output_dist)) or torch.any(output_dist < 0): raise ValueError(\\"Output distribution contains invalid values.\\") top_i = torch.multinomial(output_dist, 1)[0].item() predicted_char = index_to_char[top_i] return predicted_char, hidden \`\`\` By adding checks in your code, you can find out at which point the error occurs and take further action to resolve it, whether it's adjusting hyperparameters, fixing the model's predictions, or ensuring proper training of the model."},{"instruction":"بدي ياك تساويلي شي قصة محرزي عن التبولة","output":"طبعاً يمكننا إنشاء قصة قصيرة عن شخصية اسمها محرزي ومغامرته مع التبولة، وهي طبق شهير في المطبخ الشرق أوسطي. إليك القصة: كان يا مكان في قديم الزمان في قرية هادئة تقع بين الجبال والسهول، رجل يُدعى محرزي. محرزي كان شهيرًا في القرية لحبه للطبيعة والزراعة، إذ كان يمتلك حديقة غناء تفوح منها رائحة الأعشاب وتزهر بأجمل الخضروات والثمار. لكن من بين كل المزروعات، كان البقدونس الشغف الأكبر لمحرزي، فقد أحبّ تلك النبتة الخضراء المنعشة وكان يعتني بها بكل حب ورعاية. في يومٍ من الأيام، زارت القرية طاهية مشهورة جاءت من بلاد بعيدة لتذوق أطيب المأكولات وتتعلم عن الأطباق التقليدية. سمعت الطاهية بشغف محرزي لزراعة البقدونس وأرادت أن تذوق أفضل طبق يمكن أن يُعد بهذه العشبة. وهكذا، دُعي محرزي لإعداد طبق خاص لها. قرر محرزي أن يُعد التبولة، ذلك الطبق اللذيذ الذي يعكس تقاليد المطبخ المحلي ويُشرف حديقته. جمع أجود البقدونس من حديقته، واختار أطيب الطماطم، وقطف النعناع الطازج، وجهز البرغل الناعم. ثم أضاف بعض البصل الأخضر وعصر عليها ليمون الحمضيات الذي يُزرع على سفوح الجبال. لم ينسَ القليل من زيت الزيتون البكر من أشجار القرية العتيقة، وقليل من الملح والتوابل ليعزز النكهات. بعد أن خلط محرزي جميع المكونات بحذر، قُدمت التبولة في صحن كبير للطاهية وضيوف القرية. في تلك اللحظة، كانت كل عين تراقب لِترى ردة الفعل الأولى. وعندما غمست الطاهية ملعقتها في الطبق وتذوقت اللقيمة الأولى، أضاء وجهها بابتسامة عريضة وعم الصمت. ثم انطلقت الضحكات والأحاديث، فقد أعلنت الطاهية أن هذا أطيب طبق تبولة قد تذوقته على الإطلاق!

Despite this, most American institutions still remain intact, if having been reformed and refined. The traditional three branches of government, the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary are all still extant but have been slightly reformed. In Congress, the Senate has been abolished, and the House of Representatives becoming the House of People's Representatives (HoPR). The HoPR consists of 1,867 delegates and is partitioned into three sections; the People's Section which represents the general population, the Wheel Section which represent unions, and the Congregational Section which represents mainly Christian congregations. The United States is not a one-party state, as multiple political parties compete for seats in elections and cooperate on policy in the HoPR. That being said however, the Communist Party of America (CPA) still remains dominate in the HoPR, the Presidency, the Supreme Court, the governorships, mayorships, etc. In theory, the President does not have to be a member of the CPA, but in practice most Presidents have served as the head of the party. The nation isn't entirely dominated by the CPA however; the predominately Black southeastern region of Liberia is dominated by the African Liberian Communist Party (ALCP) and other Black majority parties. Liberia has almost always voted for the ALCP in every major election and most of their leaders and official are members of the ALCP. The some can be said for the Indigenous autonomous zones, which primarily vote for the American Indigenous Socialist Federative Foundation (AISFF). In recent elections, the CPA has waned to ALCP and the Progress—Democrats (P-D) who have made gains but have not unseat the CPA. The American Mode of Production The National American Labor Union (ALU), which is one of several labor organizations, collaborates with state planners in the Communist Party of America (CPA) on union activities. The ALU provides and maintains the commons, which include medical services, water, sanitation, and electrical services. The people of America have collective ownership of the commons, and American workers develop and produce them. These workers ship goods to export centers, receiving payment in U.S. dollars, and to the central distribution center, which in turn sends goods through primary, secondary, and tertiary nodes. The CPA, in consultation with national unions, local factories, and economic planners, designs the “Guidebook on Socialist Self-Management.” The CPA also requests quarterly reports on economic productivity from a workers’ representative in America. These workers self-manage according to the guidebook and appoint ward representatives to their respective ward chapters, which coordinate with local factories. The ward chapters elect city or state representatives to the state chapter, which coordinates and organizes several wards. The state chapters elect national representatives to the ALU. The people of America participate in communities of goods, which consist of congregations such as the Jacobites, Millerites, etc. How is the American economy different from the Soviet and Chinese economy?","output":"The American economy, as described in your counterfactual scenario, shares some characteristics with real-world socialist and communist economies such as those of the Soviet Union and China, but also displays distinct features. Here are several key ways it differs based on the information provided: 1. Multi-party system: Unlike the historical one-party systems of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the American communist state in your scenario allows for multiple political parties to compete in elections and hold seats in government. This suggests a more pluralistic political system which might influence economic decision-making by incorporating a broader range of perspectives and interests. 2. Labor Union Involvement: The National American Labor Union (NALU) plays a significant role in collaborating with the state planners and the CPA. This indicates a more decentralized approach to economic planning and management compared to the highly centralized systems in the USSR and China, where state planning commissions and the Communist Party had tight control over economic decisions. 3. Focus on Local Self-Management: American workers have a system of self-management guided by the “Guidebook on Socialist Self-Management.” This suggests that the American approach places more emphasis on local initiative and autonomy in production and distribution, in contrast to the more top-down management style that characterized the Soviet and Chinese systems, especially during their early years. 4. Elections of Labor Representatives: The process of electing representatives to the ALU from the wards all the way up to the national level indicates a more democratic and participatory approach to organization within the workforce. This is in contrast to the appointment-driven and party-led representation in Soviet and Chinese workplaces. 5. Regional Autonomy: The presence of strong regional parties like the African Liberian Communist Party (ALCP) and American Indigenous Socialist Federative Foundation (AISFF) that dominate certain areas such as the southeastern region and Indigenous autonomous zones, illustrates a degree of regional autonomy in political and economic matters - which could lead to economic policies tailored to local conditions and needs. 6. Communities of Goods: The concept of communities of goods, with congregations managing common resources, indicates a more community-based approach to the management of local resources and public goods. This contrasts with the centralized state ownership in the Soviet model and the more top-down control of the communal system in Mao-era China. 7. Payment and Distribution System: The structure of America's distribution system, with goods being sent to export centers and central distribution centers, then flowing through a network of nodes, implies a sophisticated logistics network. This might have elements of market-based mechanisms for distribution, differing from the purely planned economies of early Soviet or Maoist China. It's important to note that both the Soviet Union and China's economies evolved over time. For instance, China's economic system underwent significant changes post-Mao, with the introduction of market reforms under Deng Xiaoping, which led to a unique socialist market economy. The scenarios mentioned for the USSR and China typically refer to their early stages, which represent the most stereotypically centralized, command-based systems. In summary, the American economy in your fictitious scenario is characterized by more pluralistic political dynamics, a higher degree of worker self-management, regional autonomy, and greater involvement of labor unions in state planning and management - all of which are significant departures from historical Soviet and Chinese economic systems."},{"instruction":"So what are the central distribution centers and what exactly are the primary, secondary, and tertiary nodes?","output":"In the context of your fictional communist America, the central distribution centers and the primary, secondary, and tertiary nodes appear to comprise a network for distributing goods and services across the country. This network seems to be a hybrid system, balancing planned elements of a traditional communist economy with aspects of decentralized distribution. Here is how they might function: **Central Distribution Centers:** Central distribution centers would likely be large facilities strategically located across the nation, functioning as hubs for receiving goods produced by American workers and industries. These centers would manage the logistics of sorting, storing, and redistributing products to various parts of the country. They would be responsible for ensuring that the production of factories and collective farms meets the needs stipulated by state planning while also adapting to local demand where necessary. The centers would be critical in managing the balance between supply and demand to prevent both shortages and surpluses within the economy. **Primary Nodes:** Primary nodes are likely the first level of distribution points that receive goods directly from the central distribution centers. They would serve as regional or major city distribution hubs, spreading over substantial geographic areas or serving large populations. These nodes would break down the bulk shipments into smaller lots destined for secondary nodes and manage regional logistics. **Secondary Nodes:** Secondary nodes would be smaller than primary nodes and probably located at a more local level, such as smaller cities or districts within large cities. They would receive goods from primary nodes and further distribute them to tertiary nodes or directly to end consumers. These secondary nodes would be closer to the end users and would thus be more responsive to local demands and conditions. **Tertiary Nodes:** Tertiary nodes would represent the final step before goods reach consumers. These could be local distribution points within communities, perhaps akin to local co-ops, community stores, or delivery points where individuals can collect their allocated goods. These nodes would be the most responsive to immediate community needs and would likely have a strong feedback loop into the distribution system to adjust for local preferences, seasonal variations, and other factors. Overall, this network portrays a complex system aiming to combine the efficiency and coordination of centralized planning with the flexibility and responsiveness of decentralized distribution. This arrangement would strive to mitigate some of the weaknesses of traditional centralized planned economies, such as inefficiencies, waste, and the inability to adapt swiftly to changes in demand or supply. By involving various levels and allowing some degree of local adjustment, this economy seeks to fulfill the diverse needs of the American populace within the overarching framework of a planned socialist economy."},{"instruction":"How does this contrast with the distribution system of the Soviet Union (let's say during the Brezhnev era)?","output":"During the Brezhnev era (1964-1982), the Soviet Union's distribution system operated within the framework of a highly centralized planned economy. The state controlled all aspects of production and distribution through the Gosplan (the State Planning Committee), which was responsible for formulating Five-Year Plans to outline the nation's economic objectives. The contrasts between the fictional American system you described and the Soviet system under Brezhnev can be divided into several key areas: **1. Centralization vs. Decentralization:** The Soviet distribution system was more centralized, with decisions being made by the central government and executed down the line to the republics, oblasts, and so on. By contrast, the American model suggests an architecture where while there is still a central plan (the Guidebook on Socialist Self-Management), there is more scope for local self-management and regional autonomy, and where labor unions seem to have a significant role in economic planning and distribution. **2. Participation in Planning:** In the Brezhnev-era Soviet Union, economic planning and distribution were primarily the domain of state officials and party bureaucrats. Ordinary citizens had little to no direct influence on planning decisions. The American system depicted here suggests a more participatory approach, with workers' representatives and elected officials from labor unions involved in the planning process and decision-making regarding production and distribution. **3. Responsiveness and Flexibility:** The Soviet system often struggled with issues of supply chain responsiveness and flexibility. Production and distribution plans were made years in advance, leading to mismatches between what was produced and what was actually needed by the population. The American approach, with its structure of primary, secondary, and tertiary nodes, appears to be designed for greater responsiveness to local demand and adaptation to changing conditions through decentralized self-management. **4. Diversity of Political Influence:** Whereas in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was the sole political force with direct control over the economy, your fictional America maintains a multi-party system, even though the CPA is dominant. This could introduce diverse political opinions and policies regarding economic management, potentially leading to a distribution system that has to reconcile competing interests and perspectives. **5. Quality and Availability of Goods:** Historically, the Soviet planned economy often struggled with issues of quality control and availability of goods, leading to problems such as shortages and long queues for consumer products. While the information provided does not specify the success of the American system in terms of quality and availability, the emphasis on local self-management and the involvement of labor unions suggest an intention to better align production with demand and perhaps improve the quality of goods. **6. Regional Autonomy:** The Brezhnev-era Soviet Union did have autonomous regions, but the central government in Moscow retained ultimate authority over economic decisions. The degree of autonomy your fictional America grants to regions like \\"Liberia\\" and Indigenous autonomous zones, particularly in terms of their political and economic preferences, appears to be more substantive than what was common in the Soviet Union. In summary, while both systems seek to provide for the needs of the population without the profit motive of capitalism, the American economy as you've outlined appears to aim for greater worker participation, local self-management, and regional autonomy, which may foster a more dynamic and adaptable distribution system when compared to the Soviet system under Brezhnev."},{"instruction":"Create a humorous scam-baiting response, in the style of Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner series, to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

'착각이었어.' 오디션에 나타난 ‘조커(Joker)’를 보자마자 모든 게 산산조각났다. 위세가 무너진 건 아니었다. 그저 크리스는 최 초의 포기를 선언했고, 지금 역시 난생처음으로 ‘도전자’로서 촬영장을 향하고 있었다. 크리스가 감았던 눈을 떴고 손을 움직였다. 시나리오를 집은 것. -팔락. 그의 시나리오는 퍽 어지럽다. 분석이 빼곡했으니까. 허나 오늘은 이 노력 이상의 것을 해내야 한다. 순발력과 유 연함, 창의력 등. \\".....\\" ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'에서 크리스가 맡은 인물은 기자였다. 이름은 ‘로버트 프랭클린’. 특종에 목을 맨 전형적인 욕망 덩어리인 기자이며, 탐욕과 물욕 그리고 신박한 경험을 갈구하는 인물이었다. 더불어 '조커(Joker)'의 첫 신봉 자가 되기도 한다. 물론, ‘로버트 프랭클린’ 본인은 ‘조커(Joker)’를 이용하고자 한다. 덕분에 극 초반엔 두 인물의 대립과 심리적인 간극이 펼쳐진다. 각성한 '조커(Joker)’는 사회를 짓밟으며 날뛰기 바쁘고, ‘로버트 프랭클린’은 그를 이용해 최대한의 이득을 취한다. 오늘 크리스가 찍는 건 두 인물의 첫 대면 씬이 었다. 곧, 그가 오디션에서 목도한 ‘조커(Joker)’를 상기했다. 진짜 '조커(Joker)'가 현실에 나와, 자신을 따라 하는 배우들의 재롱을 양껏 즐기고 있었다. ‘망할, 닭살이 돋아.' 팔뚝에 돋는 두드러기. 시나리오를 보는 크리스는 절절히 느끼고 있었다. 본인이 현재 매우 긴장하고 있다는 것을. 쫄았다? 비슷하겠지만 움츠러들었다기보단 반대의 의미였다. 시험을 앞둔 도전자. 지금껏 준비는 해왔지만 실제 현실이 당도하니 초조해진다. 이쯤 -끼익. 외부 주차장에 멈추는 승합차. 주변을 보니 많은 외국인 스탭들이 뛰어다닌다. 촬영 현장에 도착했다. 크리스가 이동해야 할 곳은 트레일러였다. 하지만 그는 자신의 것이 아닌 다른 배우의 트레일러로 향했다. -똑똑. 노크하니 천천히 문이 열린다. 나타난 것은 냉랭함이 짙은 강우진. 즉, 이 트레일러는 우진이 쉬는 곳. 그를 보며 특유의 미소를 짓는 크리스. “역시 와 있었군요.” 그러나 내면으로는 비장함이 가득했다. 이를 아는지 모르는지 우진의 대답은 짧고 명료했다. “잘 부탁합니다.\\" “나 역시.\\" 답하면서도 크리스는 일전에 자신이 던진 도전장에 우진이 답한 대사를 떠올렸다. ‘하지만 즐길 수는 없을 겁니다, 각오도 필요할 테고.' 경고였다. 적당히 덤볐다간 갈가리 물어뜯길 거라는. 지금까지의 강우진 연기를 봤던 배우라면 누구든 이 타이밍 에 고민해야 했다. 크리스처럼 이미 폭발적인 탑배우인 경우는 더더욱. '피하는 게 상책이긴 해.' 저 강우진과 뒹굴어 봐야 이득 될 건 크리스에게 많지 않다. 적당히 하고 넘어가도 크리스의 인생은 앞으로도 탄 탄대로일 것. 그런데도 그는 이 순간 흥분하고 있었다. ‘이득 따윈 모르겠다, 그냥 나의 한계 앞에서 재미를 찾고 싶을 뿐.’ 이미 크리스는 자신이 맡은 기자 ‘로버트 프랭클린'의 감정을 끌어 올린 채, 눈앞의 강우진을 ‘조커(Joker)’로서 바 라보고 있었다. 카메라가 있든 없든 상관없다. 분석하고 분해하자. 지금의 이 고양과 긴장을 촬영 직전까지 끌고 간 다. 미소를 유지한 크리스가 강우진에게 말했고. “저번에 말했던 각오, 그걸 오늘 보여줄게요. 재밌게 촬영하죠.” \\"......\\" 뭔가 의욕 터지는 크리스의 표정을 묵묵히 바라보는 우진은 속으로 한숨을 내쉬었다. '빡세다, 빡세. 이 존잘 부담된다고.' 그러나 겉으로는 세상 차가웠다. “편하신 대로.” 약 두 시간 뒤. 언제든 그랬지만, 유독 오늘 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 촬영 세트는 분위기가 무거웠다. 아니, 기백이 넘친다 해야하나? 여러 모니터가 놓인 주변 안가복 감독은. “시작은 바스트로.” “그러죠.” “찍어보고 차례차례 구도를 바꿔봅시다.” “네, 감독님.\\" 촬영팀 포함 여러 키스탭들과 대화 중이었고, 백여 명 스탭들은 도시를 방불케 하는 세트 곳곳에서 세팅이 한창이 었다. 보출(보조출연)이나 이미지 단역 배우들도 보였다. 그리고. \\".....\\" 팔짱 낀 채 전체 현장을 바라보는 총괄 프로듀서 노라 포스터. 그녀 주변엔 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오' 간부들 여럿이 자 리했다. 그들은 이미 노라에게 오늘 촬영이 어떻게 굴러갈 것인지를 들은 상태였다. 반쯤은 문제없다고 생각했고 반 쯤은 걱정이 앞서는 표정이었다. 노라에게 두런두런 대화 소리가 들렸다. “안가복 감독의 욕심이 커지고 있어.” “우리도 같지 않나.” “하지만 배우들의 분위기가 너무 풀어지는 건 불필요해.” “자네들은 꽉 막힌 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'을 보고 싶은 건가?” 그들끼리도 의견이 들쑥날쑥하는 모양. 뭐 자연스러운 현상이긴 했다. 어쨌든 이들 모두 공통점이 있다면 작품을 아낀다는 것. 거기에서 파생된 걱정이나 대립이었다. 간부들 앞에 선 노라는 딱히 대화에 끼진 않았다. ‘여기서 떠들어봐야 열량 소비야, 지켜보면 될 일이고.’ 답은 촬영에서 나올 것. 그때였다. “강우진씨 준비됐습니다!!” 수백 외국인들이 즐비한 현장으로 한 무리가 등장했다. 강우진과 분장팀. 아니다, 현재 강우진은 얼굴이 허옇다. 턱까지 오는 웨트한 긴 머리, 붉은 입술과 눈썹, 빨간 재킷과 바지, 파란 셔츠, 노란 조끼, 헤진 갈색 구두, 벌겋고 퍼런 짝짝이 양말. ‘조커(Joker)’였다. 촬영존으로 걷는 우진은 모든 준비가 끝난 모습. 전체적으로 근엄함이 짙었지만, 강우진은 티 안 나게 촬영장 전 체 공기가 무겁다는 걸 인지했다. ‘왜케들 심각하냐? 나만 느끼나? 흠- 몰라, 씨. 걍 나는 하던 대로 연기나 하지 뭐.' 뒤이어. “크리스 들어갑니다!!” 동그란 안경에 갈색 재킷, 약간은 해진 청바지, 부스스한 갈색 머리인 크리스 하트넷이 입장했다. 그 역시 기자 '로버트 프랭클린' 역의 분장이 끝났다. 곧, 두 배우가 도심의 거리 위에 섰다. 잠시잠깐의 시선 교환. 하지만 대화는 없다. 오묘한 신경전일까? 크리스는 그랬다. '앞에 있으니 실감 나는군.' 반면, 강우진은 아니었다. '어우- 시선 부담.' 한 손에 촬영 콘티를 든 안가복 감독과 키스탭 몇몇이 다가왔다. 안가복 감독은 두 배우에게 적당한 디렉팅과 함 께 응원을 던졌다. “어제도 말했다만, 원하는 대로 해봐요. 첫 씬은 일단 그렇게 가는 거로.” 고개 끄덕이는 강우진과 크리스. 안가복 감독이 빠졌다. 붐 마이크와 슬레이트 든 스탭들이 붙는다. 두 명이 든 카 메라 2대가 우진과 크리스에게 할당됐다. 중형 지미집에 달린 카메라도 움직였다. 안가복 감독이 앉은 여러 모니터 엔 두 배우의 모습이 동시에 출력된다. 곧. -스윽. 자리에 앉은 안가복 감독 뒤로 노라와 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들이 섰다. 그들을 잠시 응시하던 안가복 감독이 정면으로 시선을 돌렸고. “준비.” 촬영존에 있던 수십 외국인 스탭들이 썰물처럼 주르륵 빠졌다. 강우진은 제자리. 크리스는 길 반대편으로 움직였 다. 몇몇 남아 있는 인원 중 여자 스탭이 우진의 앞 카메라에서 씬 넘버와 함께 슬레이트를 쳤다. -탁! 세트장 전체로 안가복 감독의 신호가 떨어졌다. “액션.\\" 동시에 강우진은 각인된 ‘조커(Joker)'의 모든 것을 끌어 올렸다. ‘배역 합성’과 ‘배역의 자유도’ 역시 팽배해졌다. 현실에 풀어진 ‘조커(Joker)’가 돌연 뒤쪽 카메라를 보며 입이 찢어져라 웃었다. \\"히히히!\\" 뛴다. 꽁지가 빠지게 뛴다. 하지만 카메라는 요지부동. 먼저 움직인 건 대기하고 있던 건장한 남자 두 명이었다. 그 들이 ‘조커(Joker)’를 쫓는다. 이때야 기다리던 카메라가 빠르게 뒤따랐다. 모니터엔 현장감 절절하게 흔들거린다. 이어. “저깄군.” 길 건너편의 크리스 하트넷. 아니, 기자 '로버트 프랭클린'이 다급하게 길을 건넜다. 카메라가 옆에서 따른다. 돌 연 내달리던 노란 택시가 끼익 멈췄다. ‘로버트’에게 욕을 뱉어댄다. “어이!! 정신 나갔어?!!\\" 사진기를 목에 건 ‘로버트’ 또는 크리스가 택시기사에게 중지를 보였다. \\"입 닥쳐!!\\" 여기까지는 시나리오와 같다. 곧, 크리스는 목에 건 사진기를 풀어내면서도 내내 뒤쫓던, 방금 건물과 건물 사이 로 사라진 ‘조커(Joker)’를 찾았다. 슬쩍. 꺾이는 건물 외벽에 붙은 크리스가 얼굴을 반쯤 내밀어 골목길 안을 훑었다. 순간. -탕탕탕!! 고막을 울리는 총성. \\"허업!!” 화들짝 놀란 크리스가 주륵 미끄러지며 바닥에 엎어졌다. 카메라가 위에서 그를 찍었다. 이건 애드립. 크리스가 약간 두 손을 떨며 등을 벽에 붙였고 거친 숨을 내쉬었다. “하아- 하아- 미친.” 도망가야 하나? 이대로 가면 저 총성을 뿜은 총알이 내 머리통에 박히는 거 아니야? 아- 그런데 궁금하다, 미치도 록 궁금해. 살짝만, 아주 살짝만 볼까? 저 괴물을 보고 싶어 미치겠다. 딱 이 정도의 표현이 그의 얼굴에 가득했다. 결국, 크리스는 등을 벽에 붙인 채 천천히 몸을 뒤쪽으로 틀었다. 그리곤 골목길에 다시금 얼굴을 빼꼼 내밀었다. 그런데 묘하게도 그의 눈엔 골목길 안이 아닌, 헤진 갈색 구두와 벌겋고 퍼런 짝짝이 양말이 보였다. 카메라, 크리스 의 낮은 시선에 앵글을 맞췄다. 이어 그의 눈알이 보이는 양말에서 천천히 올라갔다. 빨간 바지와 재킷을 넘어 웨트한 붉은 머리가 적당히 가린, 핏물이 튄 허연 얼굴이 자신을 내려보고 있었다. '조커(Joker)'였다. 언제 왔는지 ‘조커(Joker)' 또는 강우진이 크리스를 하대하듯 응시 중이었다. 고개를 삐뚤하게 꺾은 채 말이다. 그 려진 두터운 입술 덕에 언뜻 웃는 것처럼 보이지만 무표정이었고, 그의 손엔 은색 총이 들려 있었다. 코앞에 나타난 흉측한 ‘삐에로’ 덕에 크리스의 몸이 얼어붙었다. \\".....아.\\" 그럴 만했다. 이 역시 시나리오엔 없던 컷이니까. 원래라면 크리스가 조용히 ‘조커(Joker)’에 다가가야 했다, 하지 만 강우진은 반대로 크리스를 먼저 환대하러 나왔다. 여기서 모니터 보던 안가복 감독은 더욱더 코를 박았고. ‘수 배는 더 소름이 돋아. 그래, ‘조커(Joker)'는 언제나 예상 밖의 행동을 보여야 하지.' 뒤쪽 노라는 미간을 좁혔다. ‘공포 영화냐고, 영화관에서 봤으면 비명을 질렀겠어.' 이쯤 크리스를 내려보던 강우진의 첫 대사. 시나리오상으로는 ‘날 쫓아왔어?”였다. 하지만 총 든 손으로 볼의 핏 물을 닦던. \\"있잖아.” 찢어진 입이 더욱 두드러지게 웃던 우진의 말은 달랐다. “왜 울상이야?” \\".....\\" 앉은 채 ‘조커(Joker)’를 올려보던 크리스는 말문이 막혔다. 연기로도 실제로도. 그러다 번뜩 정신을 차린 그가 어 렵사리 답했다. “노, 놀라서?” “히히 아아- 그래. 무언가 슬픈 일이 있는지 알았잖아.” 총을 바지 앞의 배 쪽에 끼는 강우진. 웨트한 붉은 머리를 양손으로 쓸어 넘겼다. 어디선가 비명이 들리는 것 같았 다. 아랑곳없는 우진은 재차 시선을 내려 크리스에게 말했다. “재밌는 걸 보겠어?” \\".....어, 어. 그래.” “일어나, 일어나. 나와 함께 가서 보자구.” 강우진이 크리스를 부축했다. 크리스는 얼결에 일어나면서도 우진의 배 쪽에 꽂힌 총이 계속 보였다. 우진 또는 조커(Joker)'가 크리스와 어깨동무한 채 걸었다. 카메라에 찍히는 모습은 그야말로 친구끼리 걷는 것 같았다. 강우진 이 말했다. “어- 너 이름이 뭐야.” “나, 나는 로버트. 로버트 프랭클린.” “로버트 프랭클린. 반가워, 로버트.” “당신은?\\" “나? 나는 ‘조커(Joker).” “조커(Joker)'?\\" “그래.” 시선이 내려가는 우진. 크리스가 든 사진기를 본 것. “기자?\\" “어? 맞아.” “나를 쫓아 온 거지?” 눈치를 살피는 크리스. “아, 아니. 그냥 우연히.” 여기까진 시나리오 그대로였다. 허나 크리스가 없던 대사를 추가했다. “'조커(Joker)' 말고 진짜 이름은 뭐야?\\" -우뚝. 대뜸 걸음을 멈춘 강우진. 그가 잔뜩 쫄은 크리스의 양어깨에 손을 올렸다가, 천천히 간격을 좁혀 두 검지로 크리 스의 두 볼을 웃음 짓게 밀었다. “'조커(Joker)'라고 말했잖아, 친구.” \\".....\\" 눈동자가 흔들리는 크리스. 그런 그와 다시금 움직이던 우진이 두 고깃덩이가 겹쳐져 누운 앞에 섰다. 남자 둘의 이마가 뚫려있다. 순간, 크리스의 눈이 디립다 확장됐고, 비죽 미소짓던 강우진이 짜란- 느낌으로 두 손을 펼쳤다. “보라고! 즐겁지 않아?” 크리스가 부들부들 떨었다. 여기서 그의 시나리오상의 대사는 ‘당신이 죽였어?’였다. 허나 크리스는 이를 변형. “이, 이런 즐거움이 몇 번이나 있었지?\\" 움찔움찔 웃음이 터질 듯하던 우진 또는 ‘조커(Joker)'가 담배를 꺼내 입에 물고는. “프흐흐흐.” 결국, 박장대소하기 시작했다. “크크크흐흐.” 담배를 빨다가도 웃는다. 그 모습에 미간을 구긴 크리스가 되물었다. “왜, 왜 웃는 거야?” “히히히히, 하하하하.” 잠시간 시원하게 웃던 강우진이 정면 카메라를 보며 답했다, 시나리오엔 없던 대사였다. “또 다른 장난이 생각났거든.” 크리스는 몸이 굳었다. ‘조커(Joker)’가 카메라 밖에서. \\".....뭐?\\" 뭔가를 저지를 것을 확신했으니까. < 야수 (4) > 끝","output":"< Beast (4) > Chris Hartnett encounters the 'real' 'Joker' he had intended to challenge about two hours later. It's hot. The heat of his entire body, that is. What a rush of excitement he hadn't felt in how long. Having rolled around Hollywood as a top actor for over a decade, he had forgotten those things. The desperate, combative acting. In his rookie days, Chris had that too. But at some point, everything became lukewarm. His luck in choosing projects followed suit, and his handsome looks played a part as well. Once he reached the top, everyone praised Chris's acting. That's probably when he started to enjoy ad-libbing. Was it like giving CPR to his somewhat boring acting? Chris thought he was at the very top. And he was, in reality. In Hollywood, in terms of recognition and influence, Chris was tier 1. But that was only until he saw Kang Woojin. 'It was a mistake.' As soon as he saw the 'Joker' who appeared at the audition, everything shattered. It wasn't that his prestige had crumbled. Chris simply declared his initial surrender, and now, for the first time in his life, he was heading to the set as a 'challenger.' Chris opened his eyes that he had closed and moved his hand. He picked up the script. -Flap. His script was quite messy. It was filled with analysis. However, today he had to do something beyond this effort. Quick reflexes, flexibility, creativity, and so on. \\".....\\" In 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' the character Chris played was a journalist. His name was 'Robert Franklin.' A typical journalist who was a bundle of desire, hanging on to exclusive scoops, and craving greed, materialism, and novel experiences. He also becomes the first devotee of the 'Joker.' Of course, 'Robert Franklin' himself intends to use the 'Joker.' Thanks to this, the early part of the drama unfolds with the confrontation and psychological gap between the two characters. The awakened 'Joker' is busy trampling society, while 'Robert Franklin' uses him to gain the maximum benefit. Today, Chris was filming the first encounter scene between the two characters. Soon, he recalled the 'Joker' he had witnessed at the audition. The real 'Joker' had come to reality, enjoying the antics of the actors imitating him to his heart's content. 'Damn, I'm getting goosebumps.' The hives rising on his forearm. Chris, looking at the script, was feeling it intensely. That he was very nervous at the moment. Was he scared? Similar, but rather than shrinking back, it was the opposite. A challenger before a test. He had been preparing all this time, but now that reality had arrived, he was getting anxious. At this point -Creak. A van stops in the external parking lot. Looking around, many foreign staff members are running about. He has arrived at the filming location. The place Chris needed to move to was the trailer. However, he headed towards another actor's trailer, not his own. -Knock knock. When he knocked, the door slowly opened. What appeared was the cold Kang Woojin. In other words, this trailer was Woojin's resting place. Chris, seeing him, smiled his characteristic smile. “You were here, as expected.” However, inwardly, he was filled with determination. Whether Woojin knew this or not, his response was short and clear. “Please take good care of me.\\" “Me too.\\" Even as he responded, Chris recalled the lines Woojin had answered to the challenge he had thrown before. 'But you won't be able to enjoy it, you'll need to be prepared too.' It was a warning. If he took it lightly, he would be torn to shreds. Any actor who had seen Kang Woojin's acting until now would have to ponder at this timing. Especially if they were already explosive top actors like Chris. 'It would be wise to avoid.' Rolling around with that Kang Woojin wouldn't benefit Chris much. Even if he just went through the motions, Chris's life would continue to be smooth sailing. Yet, at this moment, he was excited. 'I don't care about the benefits, I just want to find fun in front of my limits.' Chris was already raising the emotions of the journalist 'Robert Franklin' he was playing, looking at Kang Woojin in front of him as the 'Joker.' Whether there was a camera or not didn't matter. Analyze and deconstruct. He would carry this excitement and tension right up to just before filming. Chris, maintaining his smile, spoke to Kang Woojin. “I'll show you the determination I talked about last time. Let's have fun filming.” \\"......\\" Woojin, silently observing Chris's enthusiastic expression, sighed inwardly. 'It's tough, tough. This handsome guy is a burden.' However, outwardly, he was as cold as the world. “Do as you please.” About two hours later. As always, but especially today, the set of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' had a heavy atmosphere. Or should it be said to be brimming with spirit? Director Anga Bok, surrounded by several monitors, said: “Let's start with a bust shot.” “Alright.” “Let's film and then change the angles one by one.” “Yes, Director.\\" He was in conversation with the filming team, including several key staff members, and around a hundred staff members were busy setting up the set, which resembled a city. Extras and image actors were also present. And. \\".....\\" Nora Foster, the overall producer with her arms crossed, was watching the entire scene. Around her were several executives from 'Columbia Studio.' They had already heard from Nora about how today's filming would go. Half of them thought there would be no problem, and the other half had worried expressions. Nora heard the chatter around her. “Director Anga Bok's ambition is growing.” “Aren't we the same?” “But it's unnecessary for the actors' atmosphere to become too relaxed.” “Do you want to see a 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' that's too stiff?” They also had mixed opinions among themselves. Well, it was a natural phenomenon. Anyway, they all had one thing in common: they cherished the work. The worries and conflicts that stemmed from that. Nora, standing in front of the executives, didn't particularly join the conversation. ‘Talking here is just a waste of energy, it's something to watch for.’ The answer would come from the filming. That's when it happened. “Kang Woojin is ready!!” A group appeared on the set crowded with hundreds of foreigners. Kang Woojin and the makeup team. No, currently, Kang Woojin's face was white. Wet long hair reaching his chin, red lips and eyebrows, a red jacket and pants, a blue shirt, a yellow vest, worn brown shoes, and mismatched red and blue socks. He was the 'Joker.' Walking towards the filming zone, Woojin looked fully prepared. Overall, he had a solemn air, but Kang Woojin subtly noticed that the air on the set was heavy. ‘Why so serious? Am I the only one feeling it? Hmm- forget it, just do my acting as usual.' Following that. “Chris is entering!!” Chris Hartnett, with round glasses, a brown jacket, slightly worn jeans, and disheveled brown hair, entered. He too had finished his makeup for the role of journalist 'Robert Franklin.' Soon, the two actors stood on the streets of the city. A brief exchange of glances. But no conversation. Was it a subtle psychological battle? Chris thought so. 'It feels real now that he's in front of me.' On the other hand, Kang Woojin did not. 'Ugh- the gaze is burdensome.' Director Anga Bok, holding the shooting continuity in one hand, approached with a few key staff members. Director Anga Bok gave the two actors some appropriate directing and encouragement. “As I said yesterday, do as you wish. Let's start the first scene that way.” Kang Woojin and Chris nodded. Director Anga Bok left. Staff with boom mics and slates approached. Two cameras were assigned to Woojin and Chris. The camera on the medium-sized Jimmy Jib also moved. The monitors where Director Anga Bok sat now displayed both actors simultaneously. Soon. -Swish. Behind the seated Director Anga Bok, Nora and the 'Columbia Studio' executives stood. After briefly observing them, Director Anga Bok turned his gaze forward. “Ready.” Dozens of foreign staff in the filming zone receded like the tide. Kang Woojin stayed in place. Chris moved to the opposite side of the street. Among the few remaining people, a female staff member hit the slate with the scene number in front of Woojin's camera. -Clap! Director Anga Bok's signal fell over the entire set. “Action.\\" Simultaneously, Kang Woojin brought up everything about the 'Joker' he had internalized. 'Role synthesis' and 'freedom of the role' also became pervasive. The 'Joker' suddenly turned to the camera behind him and laughed with a wide grin. \\"Hehehe!\\" He jumps. He jumps like his tail is on fire. But the camera is immobile. The first to move were two burly men waiting. They chased after the 'Joker.' Only then did the waiting camera quickly follow. The monitors showed a vividly shaking scene. Then. “There he is.” Chris Hartnett on the other side of the street. No, journalist 'Robert Franklin' hurriedly crossed the street. The camera followed from the side. A yellow taxi screeched to a halt. The taxi driver cursed at 'Robert.' “Hey!! Are you out of your mind?!!\\" Chris, or 'Robert,' with a camera around his neck, showed the middle finger to the taxi driver. \\"Shut up!!\\" This was the same as the script. Soon, Chris, while removing the camera from his neck, kept chasing after the 'Joker' who had just disappeared between the buildings. Sneakily. Chris, sticking to the outer wall of the building, half-stuck out his face to scan the alley. Suddenly. -Bang bang bang!! Gunshots ringing in the eardrums. \\"Whoa!!” Startled, Chris slipped and fell to the ground. The camera filmed him from above. This was an ad-lib. Chris, trembling slightly with both hands, leaned against the wall and gasped for breath. “Haah- Haah- Crazy.” Should I run away? If I stay like this, won't the bullets from that gunfire lodge in my head? Ah- but I'm curious, insanely curious. Should I take just a tiny peek? I'm dying to see that monster. His face was filled with just that expression. Eventually, Chris, leaning against the wall, slowly twisted his body backward. Then he peeked his face out into the alley again. But strangely, his eyes saw not the alley but the worn brown shoes and mismatched red and blue socks. The camera matched the angle to Chris's low gaze. Then his eyes slowly moved up from the socks. Over the red pants and jacket, the wet red hair partially covered a pale face splattered with blood, looking down at him. It was the 'Joker.' When had the 'Joker,' or Kang Woojin, come to look down on Chris condescendingly? His head was tilted at an angle. The thick lips stretched out, making it seem like he was smiling, but he was expressionless, and in his hand was a silver gun. Chris's body froze at the sight of the grotesque 'Pierrot' that had appeared before him. \\".....Ah.\\" It made sense. This cut wasn't in the script either. Originally, Chris was supposed to quietly approach the 'Joker,' but Kang Woojin had come out to welcome Chris first. Here, Director Anga Bok watching the monitors was even more engrossed. 'That's even more chilling. Yes, the 'Joker' should always show unexpected behavior.' Nora in the back narrowed her brows. 'Is this a horror movie? I would have screamed if I saw this in the cinema.' At this point, Kang Woojin, looking down at Chris, had his first line. According to the script, it was supposed to be \\"Did you follow me?\\" But while wiping the blood on his cheek with the gun in his hand. \\"Hey.\\" The torn mouth laughed even more prominently, and Woojin's words were different. “Why the long face?” \\".....\\" Chris, sitting and looking up at the 'Joker,' was at a loss for words. Both in acting and in reality. Then, suddenly regaining his senses, he replied awkwardly. “No, I'm just startled?” “Hehe, aah- I see. I thought something sad had happened.” Kang Woojin tucked the gun in front of his waist. He swept his wet red hair back with both hands. It seemed like screams were coming from somewhere. Unconcerned, Woojin looked down at Chris again and said. “Want to see something fun?” \\".....Yeah, sure.” “Get up, get up. Let's go see it together.” Kang Woojin helped Chris up. Chris stood up involuntarily, but the gun tucked into Woojin's waist kept catching his eye. Woojin, or the 'Joker,' walked arm in arm with Chris. They looked like friends walking together on camera. Kang Woojin said. “Hey- what's your name.” “Me, I'm Robert. Robert Franklin.” “Robert Franklin. Nice to meet you, Robert.” “Who are you?\\" “Me? I'm the 'Joker.'” “The 'Joker'?\\" “Yes.” Woojin's gaze dropped. He saw the camera Chris was holding. “Journalist?\\" “Uh? Yes.” “You followed me, didn't you?” Chris glanced around cautiously. “No, no. It was just a coincidence.” This was as per the script. However, Chris added a line that wasn't there. “What's your real name besides 'Joker'?\\" -Halt. Kang Woojin suddenly stopped walking. He put his hands on Chris's tense shoulders, then slowly closed the distance and pushed Chris's cheeks into a smile with two fingers. “I told you, it's 'Joker,' friend.” \\".....\\" Chris's eyes wavered. Then Woojin, moving again, stood in front of two chunks of meat lying on top of each other. The foreheads of the two men were pierced. Suddenly, Chris's eyes dilated, and Kang Woojin, grinning, spread his hands with a flourish. “Look! Isn't it fun?” Chris trembled. Here, his line in the script was supposed to be 'Did you kill them?' But Chris modified it. “How many times have you had this kind of fun?\\" Woojin, or the 'Joker,' who seemed about to burst into laughter, took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth. “Pffhaha.” Eventually, he began to laugh heartily. “Hahaha.” He laughed even while puffing on the cigarette. At this sight, Chris, with a furrowed brow, asked. “Why, why are you laughing?” “Hehehehe, hahaha.” After a moment of hearty laughter, Kang Woojin looked at the camera and answered, a line that wasn't in the script. “I just thought of another prank.” Chris froze. The 'Joker' was off-camera. \\".....What?\\" He was certain something was about to happen. < Beast (4) > End"},{"instruction":"< 야수 (6) > 어마무시한 제안을 받은 강우진이었지만 그의 대답은 심히 간결했다. 다 필요 없고 시나리오부터 가져와. 곧, ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오' 간부들이 약간 놀랐다. 미간을 좁힌 이도 있었다. ‘분위기상 구두로라도 하겠다 말할 줄 알았는데?' '첫 빌런인 ‘조커(Joker)’를 맡았으니, 의미가 있고 그것은 배우의 명예가 될 터인데- 이 배우에겐 그딴 건 씨알도 안 먹히는군.' 뭐 자연스런 반응이긴 했다. 애초 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 시나리오는 이들이 아닌 안가복 감독이 전달했고, 실질적으로 간부들은 강우진의 캐스팅 관련 반응을 처음 보는 거나 다름없다. 뭐가됐든 우진은 근엄한 얼굴이긴 했지만 딱히 심각하지도 않았다. ''삐에로:빌런의 탄생'이야 등급도 지리고 작품도 잘 뽑혔는데, 이거 다음 영화들은 또 모르잖아? 말아먹는 거면 굳이 할 이유가 없지.' ‘시네마틱 유니버스', 시리즈 영화들에 캐스팅된 배우들은 대체로 맡은 캐릭터들을 연결감 있게 출연을 지속한다. 캐릭터 욕심이나 명예 등 이래저래 이유는 많지만, 핵심적인 것 중 하나는 형성된 팬덤의 유지였다. 즉, 파급력과 뻥튀기될 인지도. 하지만 ‘아공간'이 있는 우진에겐 그런 부수적인 이유가 하등 의미가 없었다. 아쉬운 건 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 쪽. 이를 인지한 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오' 간부 중 민머리 남자가 다시 말했다. “당연히 시나리오가 완성되면 바로 넘길 생각이지만- 하하, 강우진 씨는 안 감독님 말대로 가차 없으시군요.” “저에겐 시나리오가 어떤 이유보다 중요합니다.” 이해한다는 듯 민머리 간부가 끄덕였다. 그러면서도 내년 그리고 내후년까지 계획된 것들을 브리핑했다. 말은 길었지만 축약하자면 이랬다. 헐리웃 ·빅 파이브’라 일컫는 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’가 목숨을 건, 몇 년 전부터 기획한 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’ 세계관. 그것의 스타트는 이번의 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'이었고 첫 빌런은 ‘조커(Joker)’. 빌런이 탄생했으니 히어로 역시 등장해야 했다. 그러니 당연히 두 번째 영화는 첫 등장한 히어로에 관한 작품일 것이고, 그 히어로의 세계관은 ‘조커(Joker)’와 섞 인다. 추가로 연달아 나올 세 번째 영화 역시 또 다른 히어로가 등장하며, '조커(Joker)’ 포함 이외의 다른 빌런이 출 몰한다. 물론 같은 세계관. 각 캐릭터들의 세상을 설명하면서도 이야기를 꾸려갈 작정. 그래봤자 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’가 기획한 ‘시네마틱 유니버스'의 초반부일 뿐이었다. 내후년까지 총 3개의 영화를 개봉시키는 것이 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 목표. 그러거나 말거나 우진의 시니컬한 표 정엔 딱히 변화가 없다. 사실, 그는 속으로 신기해하는 중이었다. ‘오오- 뭔가 두근두근한디? 스케일 개크네?' 다만, 그의 짙은 컨셉질로 인해 민머리 남자 포함해 모든 간부는, 강우진이 딱히 감흥을 못 느낀다고 생각했다. '역시 시나리오가 먼저인가? 아니면 몸값?' 다른 간부가 끼었다. “우진씨, 기획서 안에 당신의 예상 출연료 역시 적혀 있습니다. 보셨습니까?\\" 강우진과 최성건의 시선이 내려갔다. 곧, 우진이 어마어마한 자신의 몸값을 발견. '허! 시바!' 하마터면 겉으로 탄성이 나올 뻔했다. 이유야 심플했다. ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’보다 더 높아졌으니까. 솔직히 이젠 이 숫자들이 진짜 돈인가 싶은 우진이었다. 최성건도 전략상 티는 안 냈지만 내면으로는 충격을 금치 못했다. “미친- 헐리웃 클라스!!' 허나 허세가 드리워진 강우진의 목소리는 역시나 의연하고 차분했다. “네, 확인했습니다.” 그렇게 1시간가량 진행되던 미팅이 끝났다. 회의실을 나선 강우진은 무심함을 유지하면서도 생각했다. ‘와- 씨, 내 몸값 미쳐 날뛰네? 진심 시나리오만 나쁘지 않으면 걍 해야지.' 반면, 회의실 안 ·컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들은 심각했다. 강우진의 속내를 알 리 없었고 그의 반응이 미적지근했 으니까. “강우진에게 욕심이 안 보이던데요.....난감한데.” “난 역시 몸값 때문이라고 생각해요. 부족했던 거야.” “그것도 그거겠지만- 다음 영화의 내용도 중요하게 보는 듯하군.” “후.....이미 몸값은 꽤 높게 불렀어요. 그 이상 올리는 건 안 될 말이야.” 여러 의견이 설친다. “어쨌든 강우진을 잡으려면 올해가 가기 전에 움직여야 합니다, 이미 그는 ‘야수와 미녀’나 ‘유니버설 무비스’ 것 으로 내년까진 스케줄이 확정이라고. 행여 다른 작품이 확정되면 우리 걸 할 여유 따윈 없을 겁니다.” \\".....다음 영화에서 강우진 말고 다른 배우를 생각해야 될지도 모르겠어.” \\"조커(Joker)'에 말인가?\\" “준비는 해야 된단 얘기야.” 이때. -스윽. 조용하던 민머리 간부가 자신의 매끈한 머리를 쓸었고, 오디션 때 봤던 강우진의 ‘조커(Joker)’를 상기했다. 더불 어 지금까지 봐왔던 그의 연기들도 모두. 이내 민머리 간부가 천천히 팔짱을 꼈다. “다른 배우? 그 누가 강우진의 ‘조커(Joker)’를 넘어설 수 있겠나. 그건 비슷하게나마도 구현할 수 없어. 그걸 우린 이미 봤어, 눈이 한없이 높아졌다는 얘기지. 우리만이라면 상관없겠지만-” 미묘한 미소를 짓는 민머리 간부. “전세계 대중들은 어떤가? ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 그 ‘조커(Joker)’를 본 대중들이 다른 배우로 만족할 수 있겠어?” \\".....\\" \\".....\\" 시끄럽던 회의실이 단숨에 조용해졌다. 이어 민머리 간부가 생각만 해도 오금이 저리다는 듯 고개를 저었다. “'조커(Joker)’를 강우진에서 다른 배우로 교체한다면 아마. 아니, 100% 치솟은 관심은 저 바닥에 처박힐 거야. 그 건 곧 전체 ‘시네마틱 유니버스' 세계관이 망한다는 뜻이지.” 곧, 그가 투명파일 속 강우진의 몸값이 적힌 부분을 검지로 툭툭 건드렸다. “즉, 우린 강우진을 어떻게든 잡아야 돼. 이거 보다 두 배가 들더라도 말이지.” 뒤로. 강우진은 승합차에 탄 채 이동하고 있었다. 목적지는 그리 멀지 않다. 같은 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 내에 있는 '삐에 로:빌런의 탄생' 세트장. 그래도 워낙 이곳이 드넓었기에 걸어서는 못 간다. 이쯤 강우진은 핸드폰을 보고 있었다. '아직도 난리네.' 어제쯤 발발한, 카라의 목숨을 살려준 강우진의 영웅담은 헐리웃을 넘어 세계적으로 질펀한 상태였다. 『LA TIME/마일리 카라 구한 강우진, 한국에서도 비슷한 영웅담 있었다!』 여러 기사들 내용을 보는 우진은 돌연 의아함이 진해졌다. 그럴 만했다. ‘근데 대체 이 건은 어디서 샌 거지?' 헐리웃을 뒤집을 만한 사건이었지만, 피해 최소화를 위해 마일리 카라 측이 조용히 일을 묻었다. 뭐 그래도 강우 진에겐 딱히 상관없었다. 뭘 바라고 한 일도 아니었고, 결과적으론 카라를 구해줌으로써 그녀에게 확실한 보상도 받 았다. LA의 저택을 카라가 사줬고, 그녀의 배우 인생 최초로 한국작품인 '이로운 악' 파트1에 출연도 했다. 더불어. '마일리 카라랑 좀 더 가까워지기도 했지.' 헐리웃 진출 전, 아는 이가 전무하던 강우진에게 카라라는 거대한 인맥도 챙겼다. 나름 만족했기에 우진은 별 생 각 없이 그녀를 구해준 사건을 잊었다. 그런데 돌연 그 숨겨진 건이 수면 위로 올라왔다. 『CNM/마일리 카라 습격한 범인은 이미 수감 중, 마일리 측 “강우진에 감사하다”』 심지어 헐리웃을 뒤집을 만하게 요동친다. 현재 헐리웃 언론은 특종, 단독 같은 단어들을 붙여 마일리 카라의 습 격 사건만을 보도하고 있었다. 이쪽 각종 방송사 뉴스들도 이 건을 다루는 중. 시일이 꽤 지난 사건임에도 화력이 어마무시했다. 대상이 다름 아닌 헐리웃의 1티어 여배우인 마일리 카라였기 때문이었다. 세계적으로 슈퍼스타인, 배우로도 가수로도 최상위 포식자인 그녀의 피격 사건. 그것이 조용히 덮였다가 다시금 터졌으니 요동치는 게 당연. 더불어 그녀를 구해낸 것이 지금 헐리웃에서 가장 뜨거운, 부정이든 긍정이든 제일 핫 한 남자인 강우진이라는 것. 두 스타의 스토리가 섞이니 자극 역시 수 배 이상 튀어 올랐다. 거기다 그때의 사진이나 짧은 영상들도 돌았다. 세세한 상황이 촬영된 건 아니었으나 강우진이 여자를 제압한 장 면, 여자가 든 흉기, 아비규환에 빠진 뮤비 촬영장 등등. 영상 역시 꺅꺅 비명이 떠도는 현장의 모습이 담겼다. 그 속 엔 카라와 강우진이 선명히 찍혔다. 여기서 재밌는 것은. 『BBX/‘투나잇 쇼’로 논란이던 강우진, 마일리 카라 관련 영웅담으로 이미지 급격히 회복』 과거부터 최근의 ‘투나잇 쇼’ 뒤로 유지되던 강우진의 지저분한 댓글들이, 세계적 대중들의 반응이 예전과는 달 리 매우 달라졌다는 것. 여론과 언론의 온도가 상당히 변했다. 그렇게 잠시간 기사나 커뮤니티, SNS 등을 탐험하던 강우진에게. -우우웅, 우우우웅. 전화가 걸려왔다. 발신자로 찍힌 것은 마일리 카라. 곧, 최성건과 시선을 교환한 우진이 핸드폰을 귀에 붙였다. “네, 마일리. 접니다.” 핸드폰 너머 카라의 목소리는 의외로 침착했다. “우진씨, 기사들 확인했나요?” “네. 어제부터 보고 있는데- 혹시 이 건은 당신 쪽에서 흘렸나요?” 당연한 물음이었다. 덮은 이가 끄집어내는 것이 가장 편할 테니까. 허나 돌아오는 답변은 NO였다. “그럴 리가요. 우리도 지금 기사 보고 알았어요, 어디서 샜는지 확인해보고는 있어요. 그런데 꽤 지난 일이고 당시 현장에 있던 스탭들이 많아서 일일이 확인하는 게 쉽진 않아요.” “아무래도 그렇겠죠.” “근데 어차피 이걸 계속 덮을 수는 없다곤 생각했었어요, 우리도 그렇게 얘기했었잖아요?” 맞다. 사건 당시 강우진과 카라의 대화에서도 비슷한 말이 나왔었다. 평생 숨길 수는 없을 거라고. 이어 강우진이 무심히 고개를 끄덕였고. “네. 그래도 너무 갑자기 터져서. 문제없습니까?\\" 핸드폰 반대편 카라는 웃음 섞인 답변을 내놨다. “이럴 땐 괜찮냐는 게 어울리지 않아요? 문제없냐는 게 뭐예요.” \\"...문제없나요.” “당신답네요. 음, 딱히 문제 될 건 없어요. 전부 진실이기도 하니까. 그때 덮은 건 이래저래 정신이 없었어서 그랬 는데, 지금은 전혀 상관없죠? 우진씨, 당신은 어떤가요.” 나? 나도 뭐 똑같지. 이 사건이 밝혀져서 강우진에게 피해갈 건 전혀 없었다. “저도 같습니다.” “그럼 그냥 둬도 괜찮겠네요. 언론이나 여론이나 신나게 즐기게 냅둬요.” “그러죠.” 강우진의 심플한 대답 뒤, 핸드폰을 통해 주제 바꾼 카라의 음성이 다시 들렸다. “밥은 먹었어요? 아- 한창 촬영장 넘어가고 있으려나?\\" “맞아요.” “도착해서 뭐라도 챙겨 먹어요.” 적당히 대화를 하던 카라가 전화를 끊었다. 핸드폰을 내리는 우진은 포커페이스를 유지했지만, 그의 심장은 묘하 게 뛰고 있었다. '뭐냐 방금 끊기 전 대화들. 그냥 완전 사귀는 투잖아??' 이때 최성건이 끼었다. “마일리가 뭐래?\\" 재빨리 컨셉질을 장착한 우진이 목소리를 깔았다. “그쪽에서 흘린 건 아니고, 전혀 상관없다고 합니다.” “그래? 흠- 묘한데. 나는 당연히 카라가 오픈했다고 생각했거든. 타이밍이 그렇잖아? 너 이미지가 좀 지저분해진 상황에, 이런 영웅담이 시원하게 터진다는 게 우연적으로 되진 않지.” 턱을 쓸던 최성건이 머리 굴리는 걸 중단했고. “됐다, 그쪽이나 우리 쪽이나 별 문제 될 게 없는데 그냥 굴러가게 두지 뭐.” 돌연 그가 비죽 웃었다. “근데 그림이 웃기지 않냐?” “어떤 게 말입니까?” “아니, 너는 지금 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’가 목숨을 건 ‘시네마틱 유니버스'의 첫 빌런인데, 그 '조커(Joker)’가 현실에 선 카라의 목숨을 구했다는 거. 오묘하달까?” 미소짓던 최성건이 ‘조커(Joker)’와 비슷하게 입꼬리를 올렸다. “'삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 개봉하면 이 건도 나중에 다시 회자되겠어.” 이어 시간이 녹았다. 여러 이슈들이 터지는 헐리웃에 몸담은 강우진은 촬영의 연속이었다. 물론, 기타 등등으로 잡스러운 스케줄도 많 았지만 핵심은 촬영. “컷, OK. 우진군 이번엔 자유롭게 한 번 가보겠나?\\" “알겠습니다.” 억압된 것이 풀린 노장 안가복 감독은 몇 배나 기세가 올랐다. 참고로 노라는 처음과는 달리 현장에 나오는 횟수 가 줄었다. 그렇게 한주가 게눈 감추듯 사라졌다. 벌써 7월 셋째 주였다. 명확히는 18일 월요일. 시간은 이른 아침. 한창 헐리웃이고 한국이고 여러 소식들이 추가되 는 와중에, LA 저택에서 방금 나온, 무던한 얼굴에 모자를 푹 눌러쓴 강우진이. -텅! 대기하고 있던 승합차에 올랐다. 곧, 최성건이나 팀원들에게 낮은 톤으로 인사한 강우진이 한 시나리오를 집었다. ‘보자보자-’ ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'이 아니었다. ‘야수와 미녀'였다. 이유야 간단했다. 그는 지금. 『LA에서 활개치는 ‘월드스타' 강우진! 오늘 18일, '야수와 미녀' 대본리딩 돌입』 ‘야수와 미녀' 대본리딩장을 향하고 있었으니까. < 야수 (6) > 끝","output":"< Beast (6) > Kang Woojin received an astonishing offer, but his response was extremely concise. Just bring the script first. Soon, the executives of 'Columbia Studio' were slightly surprised. Some furrowed their brows. 'Thought he'd at least verbally agree given the atmosphere?' 'Being the first villain, the 'Joker,' it has significance and would be an honor for an actor - but it seems that actor couldn't care less.' It was a natural reaction. Originally, the script for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' was delivered by Director Anga Bok, and essentially, the executives were seeing Kang Woojin's reaction to the casting for the first time. Regardless, Woojin's face was solemn but not particularly serious. ''Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' has a great rating and the project was well-selected, but who knows about the next movies? If they're going to flop, there's no reason to do them.' Actors cast in 'Cinematic Universe' series movies typically continue to appear in a connected manner with their characters. There were many reasons, such as character greed or honor, but one of the key reasons was maintaining the established fandom. In other words, the impact and inflated recognition. However, for Woojin, who had 'subspace,' such secondary reasons were utterly meaningless. The ones disappointed were from 'Columbia Studio.' Realizing this, a bald executive from 'Columbia Studio' spoke again. \\"Of course, we plan to pass on the script as soon as it's complete - haha, Mr. Kang Woojin, you're as uncompromising as Director Ang says.\\" \\"The script is more important to me than any other reason.\\" The bald executive nodded as if he understood. Nevertheless, he briefed them on the plans for the next year and the year after. The talk was long, but to sum it up, it was like this: The 'Cinematic Universe' worldview, which 'Columbia Studio,' known as one of Hollywood's 'Big Five,' had been planning for years, risking their lives. The start of it was this 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' and the first villain was the 'Joker.' Since a villain was born, a hero had to appear as well. So, naturally, the second movie would be about the first hero to appear, and the hero's world would intertwine with the 'Joker.' Additionally, the third movie to follow would introduce another hero, and other villains, including the 'Joker,' would emerge. Of course, it's the same universe. They intended to explain each character's world while weaving the story together. Still, it was only the beginning of the 'Cinematic Universe' planned by 'Columbia Studio.' Releasing a total of three movies by the year after next was the goal of 'Columbia Studio.' Regardless, Woojin's cynical expression didn't change much. In fact, he was inwardly amazed. 'Wow - this is kind of thrilling? The scale is huge?' However, due to his thickly laid concept, all the executives, including the bald man, thought that Kang Woojin wasn't particularly moved. 'Is it the script first? Or the price tag?' Another executive chimed in. \\"Mr. Woojin, your expected appearance fee is also written in the proposal. Have you seen it?\\" Kang Woojin and Choi Sunggeon's gaze dropped. Soon, Woojin discovered his staggering fee. 'Whoa! Shit!' He almost let out an exclamation outwardly. The reason was simple. It was higher than for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' Honestly, Woojin was now wondering if these numbers were even real money. Choi Sunggeon also didn't show it for strategic reasons, but he was inwardly shocked. \\"Crazy - Hollywood class!!\\" However, Kang Woojin's voice, draped in pretense, was still calm and composed. \\"Yes, I've checked.\\" After about an hour, the meeting ended. Leaving the conference room, Kang Woojin maintained his indifference but thought to himself. 'Wow - my fee is going crazy? Seriously, if the script isn't bad, I should just do it.' On the other hand, the executives inside the 'Columbia Studio' conference room were serious. They had no idea of Kang Woojin's true feelings, and his reaction had been lukewarm. \\"Kang Woojin doesn't seem to have any greed... this is troubling.\\" \\"I still think it's about the fee. It wasn't enough.\\" \\"That might be part of it, but - the content of the next movie seems important to him too.\\" \\"Sigh... we've already offered a pretty high fee. Raising it further is out of the question.\\" Various opinions were exchanged. \\"Anyway, if we want to secure Kang Woojin, we need to move before the year ends. He's already confirmed for 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Universal Movies' until next year. If he confirms another project, he won't have time for ours.\\" \\".....Maybe we need to consider another actor besides Kang Woojin for the next movie.\\" \\"For the 'Joker'?\\" \\"We need to be prepared for that.\\" At that moment. -Swish. The quiet bald executive stroked his smooth head and recalled Kang Woojin's 'Joker' from the audition. And all of his performances he had seen so far. Then the bald executive slowly crossed his arms. \\"Another actor? Who could surpass Kang Woojin's 'Joker'? We can't even replicate something similar. We've already seen that, it means our standards have become incredibly high. It wouldn't matter if it was just us -\\" The bald executive wore a subtle smile. \\"What about the global audience? Will the public, who have seen the 'Joker' in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' be satisfied with another actor?\\" \\".....\\" \\".....\\" The noisy conference room suddenly fell silent. Then the bald executive shook his head as if the mere thought made his flesh crawl. \\"If we replace the 'Joker' from Kang Woojin to another actor, then probably. No, the skyrocketing interest will definitely hit rock bottom. That means the entire 'Cinematic Universe' is doomed.\\" Soon, he tapped the part of the transparent file that listed Kang Woojin's fee with his index finger. \\"In short, we need to secure Kang Woojin at all costs, even if it costs twice as much.\\" Meanwhile. Kang Woojin was in a van, on the move. The destination wasn't far. The set of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' within 'Columbia Studio.' Still, the place was so vast that it couldn't be reached on foot. At this point, Kang Woojin was looking at his phone. 'It's still chaos.' The heroic tale of Kang Woojin saving Miley Kara's life, which erupted yesterday, was in a messy state worldwide, beyond Hollywood. \\"LA TIME/Miley Kara saved by Kang Woojin, similar heroic tales existed in Korea!\\" Woojin, reading various articles, suddenly felt puzzled. It made sense. 'But where did this leak from?' It was an event that could turn Hollywood upside down, but Miley Kara's side had quietly buried the incident to minimize damage. Anyway, it didn't really matter to Woojin. It wasn't something he did with expectations, and as a result, he had saved Kara and received a definite reward. Miley Kara bought him a mansion in LA, and for the first time in her acting career, she appeared in the Korean production 'Beneficial Evil' Part 1. Furthermore. 'I've gotten a bit closer to Miley Kara.' For Kang Woojin, who had no acquaintances before breaking into Hollywood, Kara was a massive connection. He was quite satisfied, so Woojin had forgotten the incident where he saved her without much thought. But suddenly, that hidden incident surfaced. \\"CNM/Miley Kara's assailant already incarcerated, Miley's side 'grateful to Kang Woojin'\\" Moreover, it was causing a stir enough to flip Hollywood. Currently, Hollywood media were reporting on Miley Kara's assault incident with words like exclusive and scoop. Various news outlets were also covering the incident. Despite some time having passed since the incident, the firepower was immense. The target was none other than Hollywood's tier 1 actress, Miley Kara. The shooting incident involving the global superstar, a top predator as both an actress and a singer. It had been quietly covered up and now resurfaced, so it was natural for it to cause a stir. Additionally, the one who saved her was Kang Woojin, the hottest man in Hollywood right now, whether in a negative or positive light. The story of the two stars mixed, and the stimulation jumped several times over. On top of that, photos and short videos from that time were circulating. Although the detailed situation wasn't captured, there were scenes of Kang Woojin subduing the woman, the weapon the woman held, and the chaotic music video set. The videos also contained the scene with screams in the background. Kara and Woojin were clearly captured in them. Here's the interesting part. \\"BBX/'Tonight Show' controversy Kang Woojin, image rapidly recovering with heroic tale related to Miley Kara\\" The filthy comments about Kang Woojin, which had persisted from the past to after the 'Tonight Show,' had changed significantly in the reaction of the global public. The temperature of public opinion and the media had changed considerably. As Kang Woojin explored articles, communities, and social media for a while. -Vroom, vroom. A call came in. The caller ID showed Miley Kara. Soon, after exchanging glances with Choi Sunggeon, Woojin put the phone to his ear. \\"Hello, Miley. It's me.\\" Miley's voice on the other end of the phone was surprisingly calm. \\"Woojin, have you seen the articles?\\" \\"Yes. I've been watching since yesterday - did you leak this by any chance?\\" It was a natural question. The one who covered it up would have the easiest time bringing it out. However, the answer that came back was NO. \\"Why would I? We also just found out about the articles, and we're checking where it leaked from. But it's quite an old issue, and there were many staff on the scene at the time, so it's not easy to check everyone.\\" \\"That makes sense.\\" \\"But I thought we couldn't keep it covered forever, you know? We talked about that, didn't we?\\" Right. Similar words had come up in the conversation between Kang Woojin and Kara at the time of the incident. That it couldn't be hidden forever. Then, Woojin nodded indifferently. \\"Yes. But it exploded so suddenly. Is there a problem?\\" On the other side of the phone, Kara replied with a laugh mixed in. \\"Isn't it more fitting to ask if it's okay now? What do you mean, is there a problem?\\" \\"...Is there a problem?\\" \\"That's more like you. Hmm, there's no real problem. It's all true, after all. We covered it up back then because things were so chaotic, but now it doesn't matter at all, right? Woojin, what about you?\\" Me? I'm the same. This incident coming to light wouldn't harm Kang Woojin in any way. \\"I'm the same.\\" \\"Then we can just let it be. Let the media and public opinion have their fun.\\" \\"Sure.\\" After Kang Woojin's simple answer, Kara's voice changed the subject again through the phone. \\"Have you eaten? Ah- you must be on your way to the set now?\\" \\"That's right.\\" \\"Make sure to eat something when you arrive.\\" After a suitable conversation, Kara hung up. Woojin put down the phone, maintaining his poker face, but his heart was strangely beating. 'What was that just before hanging up? That was totally like we're dating, right??' At that moment, Choi Sunggeon joined in. \\"What did Miley say?\\" Quickly putting on his concept, Woojin lowered his voice. \\"She said it wasn't from her side, and it doesn't matter at all.\\" \\"Really? Hmm - that's curious. I naturally thought Kara had opened it up. The timing is like that, isn't it? Your image got a bit dirty, and then this heroic tale bursts out refreshingly. It doesn't just happen by coincidence.\\" Choi Sunggeon, who had been stroking his chin, stopped pondering. \\"Let it be, there's no problem on either side, just let it roll.\\" Suddenly, he smirked. \\"But isn't the picture funny?\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"Well, you're currently the first villain in 'Columbia Studio's' life-or-death 'Cinematic Universe,' and that 'Joker' saved Kara's life in reality. Isn't that odd?\\" Smiling, Choi Sunggeon lifted the corners of his mouth like the 'Joker.' \\"When 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' is released, this will be brought up again later.\\" Time then melted away. Kang Woojin, immersed in Hollywood with various issues erupting, was in a continuous cycle of filming. Of course, there were many miscellaneous schedules with other things, but the core was filming. \\"Cut, OK. Woojin, shall we go freely this time?\\" \\"Understood.\\" Director Anga Bok, freed from oppression, had his spirits multiplied. By the way, Nora, unlike at the beginning, had reduced her visits to the set. And so, a week vanished in the blink of an eye. It was already the third week of July. Specifically, Monday the 18th. It was early morning. While various news from Hollywood and Korea were being added, Kang Woojin, who had just left the LA mansion with a nonchalant face and a cap pressed down. -Thump! He got into the waiting van. Soon, after greeting Choi Sunggeon and the team members in a low tone, Kang Woojin picked up a script. 'Let's see-' It wasn't 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' It was 'Beauty and the Beast.' The reason was simple. He was now. \\"LA's soaring 'World Star' Kang Woojin! Today, on the 18th, enters script reading for 'Beauty and the Beast'\\" Heading to the script reading for 'Beauty and the Beast.' < Beast (6) > End"},{"instruction":"< 야수 (7) > 5만 평 규모의 ‘spt 스튜디오’. 시간은 늦은 아침. ‘야수와 미녀'의 대부분의 촬영이 이루어질 이 어마어마하게 드넓은 세트단지. 이곳은 현재 세 트 공사가 대략 80% 완료된 상태였다. 이미 완성된 곳도 있었고 한창 막바지인 세트도 보인다. 그런 세트 중 제일 처음으로 공사를 마친 세트가 눈에 띈다. 세트 연회장이었다. 천장에 달린 넘치는 샹들리에부터 바닥과 기둥 등의 문양이 휘황찬란한 연회장. 흰색에 금빛이 칠해진 피아노까 지. 차후 ‘야수’와 ‘미녀 벨라’의 정이 쌓일 장소였지만, 지금은 ‘야수와 미녀'의 백여 명 제작진이 몰려있었다. 중앙 에 놓인 커다란 책상 하며 그 위에 올려진 다양한 다과 등등. 정말 연회를 하는 모양새. 다만, 이들이 바삐 세팅하는 건 연회를 하기 위함이 아닌, 곧 성대하게 열릴 대본리딩 때문에 분주한 것. 눈코 뜰 새 없이 손과 발을 움직이는 걸 보니 대본리딩이 임박했음을 알 수 있었다. 이윽고. “안녕하십니까-\\" 테스트용 카메라와 제작진이 몰린 연회장으로 첫 번째 손님이 입장했다. ‘야수와 미녀’의 조연급 헐리웃 배우였 다. 마을 사람 중 ‘미녀 벨라’의 아버지 역인, 초반 ‘야수’와 ‘미녀 벨라'의 연결점 역할인 남자 중년 배우는 연회장에 들어서자마자 약간 눈이 커졌다. \\"오.\\" 퍽 대단한 규모와 세트에 감탄했으니까. 따라서 그는 자신의 자리에 앉기도 전에 세트 연회장 이곳저곳을 누볐다. 얼마나 제대로 만들어 놨는지. '당연하겠지만 퀄리티가 상당한데? 내가 ‘야수와 미녀' 세상에 들어온 착각이 드는군.’ 금방이라도 ‘야수'가 튀어나올 것 같은 퀄이었다. 그가 연회장을 돌며 구경하는 와중에 속속 배우들이 추가됐다. 대체로 조연급 배우들이었고 그들 모두 입장과 함께. “안녕하세요- 와우! 연회장 엄청난데요??\\" “하하, 내가 생각한 것보다 수 배는 화려해!” “정말 작정하고 만들었네요.” 대본리딩 준비보다는 세트 연회장을 둘러보느라 바빴다. 자연스런 행동이었고 다분히 그럴 만했다. ‘야수와 미녀' 는 세계적으로 화제 중인 실사화 작품이며, 시나리오를 숙지한 배우들에게도 추억 속 상상해오던 그림과 판박이였 으니까. 퀄만 따지면 그 이상이었다. 어쨌든 그렇게. “이야- 이게 그 ‘야수’의 피아노?” “이것 좀 봐요! 문양들 짜임새가 대단해요!” 마치 짠 듯이 세트 연회장을 구경하던 배우들은 가까스로 자신의 자리에 앉기 시작했다. 배역표가 올려진 커다란 ᄆ자 책상의 빈자리가 점차 채워진다. 뒤늦게 시나리오를 펴면서도 기분 좋게 대화를 나누는 배우들. 대본리딩 전체 분위기는 대체로 화기애애했다. 굳이 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 때와 비교하자면, 그쪽은 진중한 느낌이었다면 이쪽은 발랄했다. 물론, 도착한 헐리웃 배우들 입에선 강우진의 얘기가 오르내렸다. “야수'의 강우진씨를 보신 적 있는 분?” “어어, 저 봤어요! ‘투나잇 쇼’ 출연하신 거.” “아니아니 직접 본 거 말하는 거예요, 실제로 그 배우 본 사람 있어요?” “저번에 패션 파티에서 봤습니다. 잠깐이긴 하지만.” “오, 어때요?” “글쎄요, 정말 스치듯 본 거라 장담할 순 없지만- 뭐랄까 굉장히 시니컬한 분위기던데요? 같은 작품 나오니까 인 사해볼까? 했었는데 실패했어요. 말 걸기가 약간 어려워서.” “흠- 방송 나온 것만 봐도 조금 냉랭한 부분이 보이긴 하더라고요.” 누가 뭐래도 헐리웃에서 가장 핫한 배우는 강우진이었고, 이 ‘야수와 미녀' 자체에서도 마찬가지였다. 이어 강우 진으로 한창 시끄럽던 주제에 마일리 카라도 추가된다. “'야수'가 촬영도 전에 '미녀 벨라'를 구해준 모양이던데.” “아아! 그 사건! 마일리 습격한 걸 강우진이 구해준 거! 기사 보니까 정말 사건이 섬뜩하던데요? 뮤비 촬영 현장에 우진씨가 없었다면 큰일 났을 거야.” “기사 몇 개 보니까 강우진씨는 한국에서 비슷한 영웅담이 있던데요?” “보면 볼수록 신기한 배우야, 그는.” 두 주연 배우의 얘기가 심화된다. 주제도 점차 몸집을 불렸다. 지금 헐리웃을 달구는 카라의 습격 사건부터, 강우 진이 촬영 중인 또는 준비 중인 작품들, 그의 '노빠꾸’ 인터뷰 등등. 그사이 배우들이 앉은 ᄆ자 책상 주변으로 백여 명 스탭들이 자리를 잡았고, 출입 허가된 기자들이나 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 관계자들도 꽤 들어찬 상태였다. 머릿수가 200명을 훌쩍 넘었다. 그때였다. “안녕하세요.” 정수리 쪽은 갈색이지만, 어깨로 갈수록 금발로 변하는 헐리웃 탑여배우가 인사하며 나타났다. 몇몇이 마일리 카 라로 착각했다. 하지만 아니었다. 그녀는 마리아 아르마스였다. 마일리 카라와 그닥 사이가 좋지 않은 마리아는, 이 커다란 연회장에 모인 배우들과 적당히 인사하면서도 바로 자리에 앉았다. '흠-' 딱히 친한 배우가 없는지, 왁자지껄한 대화에 끼지 않은 그녀는 주변을 훑었다. 강우진도 마일리 카라도 아직 도 착하지 않았다. 흥미가 식은 마리아가 시나리오에 시선을 내릴 때였다. -스윽. 금발을 쓸며 추가로 입장한 탑여배우. 마리아와는 달리 퍽 정겹게 인사를 던지는 그녀. ‘미녀 벨라' 역의 마일리 카라였다. 카라가 나타나자 가뜩이나 소란스럽던 대본리딩장의 흥분도가 치솟았다. “마일리! 오랜만이네요!\\" “큰일을 겪었더라구요, 괜찮아요?” “지금 한창 다들 그 얘기로 정신없었어요, 반가워요 마일리!” 그런 배우들부터 스탭들 등등에게 미소를 보이며 화답하는 마일리 카라. “다들 걱정해줘서 감사합니다. 근데 사건 자체가 꽤 오래된 일이고 저 정말 괜찮아요. 살아 있어요.” “하하하, 당연히 살아 있으니 여길 왔겠죠!” 카라가 나타나고 분위기가 과열된다. 그 모습을 말없이 지켜보던 마리아. \\".....흥.\\" 그녀는 이 과열됨이 딱히 마음에 들지 않았다. 아니, 정확하게 말하자면 언제나 그렇듯 카라가 별로였다. ‘왜 저렇게 예쁜 거야? 역시나 마음에 안 들어.' 그렇기에 카라에 시선도 안 주는 마리아는 그저 시나리오를 넘겨댔다. 하지만 그녀와 두 칸 떨어진 곳에 앉은 카 라가 먼저 말을 걸었다. 거의 속삭이듯. “마리아, 어차피 같은 작품을 찍게 됐는데 인사는 하지? 기자들도 있잖아?\\" 지척의 간이 의자에 앉은, 현재도 배우들을 찍기 바쁜 기자들을 힐끔한 마리아가 짧게 한숨 쉬었다. “후- 그래, 어서 와 마일리. 위험한 일을 겪었다고? 아무 일 없어서 다행이었네.” 대사에 리듬이 소멸한 모습에 카라가 작게 웃었다. “걱정에 진심을 좀 담아, 그래도 고마워. 그리고 일전에 이것저것을 알려준 것도.” \\"뭐?\\" “아니야.” 강우진 관련 정보를 준 것에 감사함을 표한 카라였지만, 미간을 좁힌 마리아는 영문을 모르겠다는 얼굴이었다. 그때였다. -즉. 세트 연회장으로 흑발의 남자가, 이 곳에서 유일한 한국 배우인 그가 낮은 톤으로 인사하며 들어섰다. “안녕하세요.” 단숨에 수백 외국인들의 시선을 독차지하는 그. 강우진이었다. 관심 폭발인 상황 속임에도 담백하게 반응한 우진의 표정엔 포커페이스가 진했으나. '어우- 인간들 봐라, 많다 많아.’ 속내론 약간의 긴장이 있긴 했다. 그런 우진이 책상 위 배역 표 중 ‘야수’라 적힌 자리에 앉았다. 바로 배우들에게 인사나 질문들이 쏟아졌고, 사이에는 건너편에 앉은 마일리 카라도 포함이었다. “우진씨, 컨디션은 어때요?” 이 세트 연회장엔 수많은 헐리웃 배우가 포진됐지만, 그 누구도 강우진에겐 보이지 않았다. 현재 그가 가장 신경 쓰는 사람은 마일리 카라뿐. 곧, 카라와 눈을 맞춘 강우진이 가장 처음 든 생각은. \\"...나쁘지 않습니다.” “다행이네요.” 그녀가 아무렇지 않다는 거였다. 여유가 넘친달까? ‘뭐야, 괜히 나만 신경 쓰고 있던 건가? 하긴. 남자야 겁나 만나 봤겠지.’ 마치 일전의 그 고백 공격이 강우진의 꿈이었던 것처럼. 그러나 사실 이는 강우진이 착각이었다. “아으! 눈 마주치기가 왜 이렇게 힘든 거야!' 금발의 카라는 지금 혼자 고군분투 중이었으니까. 한편, 같은 LA. ‘빅 파이브’ 영화사 중 ‘유니버설 무비스’였다. 거대한 영화사 내의 한 스튜디오에 익숙한 인물들이 즐비했다. 거 인 흑인인 조셉 펠튼, 다리 꼰 채 앉은 메건 스톤 등등. 얼추 20명 넘는 이들은 모두 ‘존 페르소나'의 제작진으로 구성 된 인물들이었다. 그러니 당연히. \\"흠-\\" 헐리웃 거장 감독인 대니 랜디스도 포함이었다. 최근 프리 프로덕션의 시동을 건 ‘존 페르소나’ 팀이었고, 반쯤 벗겨진 머리의 대니 랜드스 감독 포함 현재는 제작 1차 회의 중. PPT와 함께 여러 가지 얘기가 나오는 중이었다. 시나리오, 배우 캐스팅, 추가될 키스탭, 전체적인 촬영 일정 등등등. 초반 설계를 잘 잡아야 문제없이 굴러갈 테니까. 뭐 요란하게 골격을 잘 만든다 해도 영화 제작이란 언제든 잡음 이 터질 순 있다. 그렇기에 더더욱 초기 빌드업이 중요하다. 뭐가됐든 한창 미래의 촬영 일정을 논의하던 분위기가 배우 캐스팅으로 넘어갔다. 정면으로 캐디인 메건 스톤이 나왔고, 중형 스크린에는 여러 헐리웃 배우들이 출력됐다. “1차 배우 리스트입니다.” 가안 캐스팅보드를 보던 대니 감독이 턱을 쓸었다. 그는 스크린 제일 상단에 뜬 한국 배우부터 눈에 띄었다. 명확 하게는 ‘존 페르소나’의 남주인 강우진이었다. ''존 페르소나’는 내용상 남주의 세계관이 매우 많은 비중을 차지해.' 따라서 앞으로 캐스팅될 배우들은 무조건 강우진과 마스크가 잘 어우러져야 했다. 어느 영화가 안 그러겠느냐마 는, 특히 ‘존 페르소나'는 주인공의 중요도가 상당하기에 몇 배는 중요했다. 이어 띄워진 여러 헐리웃 배우들이 감독 의 시선에 스친다. 쟁쟁한, 위세가 대단한 탑배우들. 여주부터 여러 빌런 등등. 이때. -스윽. 브리핑이 진행되는 와중에 거인인 조셉이 대니 감독의 옆에 붙었다. “감독님.\\" 뭔가 비밀스런 얘기를 할 모양인지 그의 목소리가 작다. “아직 넘어야 할 산이 많지만, ‘유니버설 무비스’ 쪽에선 ‘존 페르소나’의 후속편까지 생각하고 있는 것 같습니다.” \\".....시리즈?\\" “네. 제겐 3편까지를 요구했고, 현재 ·존 페르소나'를 쓴 각본가에게도 전달된 상황입니다.” “길게 보는군.” “시나리오에서 가능성을 본 거죠.” “그래서?” “감독님께도 미리 언질을 드립니다. 아직 1편의 시작점이지만, 제작 도중 고민을 부탁드립니다.” “자네는 하기로 한 건가?” 작게 미소짓는 조셉. “저야 프리랜서니까요. ‘존 페르소나’에 많은 시간을 쏟기도 했고.” “그렇군.\\" 천천히 고개 끄덕이던 대니 감독이 다른 것을 물었다. “'존 페르소나’를 3편까지 예상한다라- 그럼 나보다 강우진부터 섭외해야 되지 않겠나? 감독이야 교체돼도 큰 문 제 없겠지만 남주가 바뀌는 건 독일 테니.” “맞습니다, 이번엔 늦지 않게 빨리 움직일 참입니다.” 이때. -똑똑. 회의가 한창인 스튜디오에 노크 소리와 함께 외국인 한 명이 추가로 들어왔다. 조셉이 추가로 캐스팅한 키스탭이 었다. 액션이 매우 진한 ‘존 페르소나'였기에, 방금 입장한 키스탭은 당연히 액션 관련 인물이었다. 그런데 상당히 낯익다. 그런 남자를 조셉이 소개했다. “우리 팀에 합류한 에단 스미스입니다. 에단, 잘 부탁해요.” “잘 부탁합니다.” 코가 큰 그는 ‘이로운 악’에서 강우진과 연이 있는, ‘이로운 악’의 CQC를 몇 배나 화려하게 만들었던. “잘 부탁합니다.” 스턴트 코디네이터 에단 스미스였다. 약 1시간 뒤, ‘야수와 미녀' 리딩장. 어느새 빈틈없이 가득찬 세트 연회장. 배우들은 물론이며 ‘야수와 미녀'의 주요 제작진들까지. 지금은 이미 대본 리딩이 시작된 참이었다. 배우 소개는 당연히 ᄆ자 책상 상석에 앉은, 코끝에 검은 뿔테 안경을 걸친 빌 로트너 감독 이 맡았다. “'야수' 역의 강우진씨.” 강우진을 시작으로 카라와 마리아 아르마스. 그리고 주·조연과 조연 외의 모든 배우들의 이름이 호명됐다. 끝으 로 빌 로트너 감독이 자신을 소개한 뒤 ‘야수와 미녀' 시나리오를 펼쳤고, 배우들부터 관계자들 모두 그와 같은 행동 을 보였다. 기자들은 사진찍기 바빴다. 참고로 중간중간 삽입될 단체 노래들은 나중에 따로 맞춘다. 뒤로 약 10분쯤 흘렀을까? “벨라! 벨라!! 대체 이 아이는 또 어디를 간 거야?” ‘야수와 미녀’ 대본리딩의 초반은 ‘야수’보다는 ‘미녀 벨라’ 위주였다. 그녀가 ‘야수’의 성까지 넘어간 건 여러 배 우들의 대사 후였다. 이윽고 마일리 카라와 강우진의 첫 대사가 리딩장에 퍼졌다. 큰 문제는 없었다. 다만. \\"음?\\" 시작부터 큰 디렉팅 없이 배우들의 대사와 연기를 지켜보던 빌 로트너 감독이. ‘마일리- 지금 뭔가.' 강우진과 대사치는 마일리 카라에게서 뭔가 요상함을 깨달았다. 그 덕에. “잠깐만.” 감독은 리딩된 지 30분 만에 처음으로 진행을 중단시켰고, 배우들 모두가 지켜보는 가운데 가까이 앉은 카라에게 디렉팅했다. “마일리, 왜 벌써부터 ‘야수’를 애정하는 눈으로 보는 건가?” < 야수 (7) > 끝","output":"< Beast (7) > The 'spt studio' spans 50,000 pyeong (approximately 165,290 square meters). It's late morning. The majority of the filming for 'Beauty and the Beast' will take place in this immensely vast set complex. Currently, the set construction is about 80% complete. Some areas are already finished, and others are in the final stages of construction. Among these sets, the first one to be completed catches the eye. It's the banquet hall set. From the overflowing chandeliers hanging from the ceiling to the ornate patterns on the floors and pillars, the banquet hall is resplendent. Even a white piano with gold accents is present. This place would later become the setting where 'Beast' and 'Bella' grow closer, but for now, it was crowded with about a hundred members of the 'Beauty and the Beast' production team. There's a large table in the center with various refreshments laid out on top. It looks like a real banquet. However, the busy setting is not for a banquet but for the upcoming grand script reading. The hustle and bustle of hands and feet moving non-stop indicated that the script reading was imminent. Eventually. \\"Good morning-\\" The first guest entered the banquet hall, filled with test cameras and production staff. It was a Hollywood actor of supporting role caliber in 'Beauty and the Beast.' The middle-aged male actor, who plays 'Bella's' father, a villager and an early connection point between 'Beast' and 'Bella,' widened his eyes as he stepped into the banquet hall. \\"Oh.\\" He was impressed by the grand scale and set. Therefore, before even taking his seat, he explored the banquet hall set here and there. To see how well it was made. 'It's expected, but the quality is quite something. I feel like I've stepped into the world of 'Beauty and the Beast.' It felt like the 'Beast' could jump out at any moment. As he toured the banquet hall, more actors arrived. They were mostly supporting actors, and all of them upon entering. \\"Hello- Wow! Isn't this banquet hall amazing??\\" \\"Haha, it's several times more splendid than I imagined!\\" \\"They really went all out making this.\\" They were more preoccupied with touring the banquet hall set than preparing for the script reading. It was a natural behavior and quite justified. 'Beauty and the Beast' was a globally trending live-action project, and for the actors who had familiarized themselves with the script, it was the spitting image of the world they had imagined in their memories. The quality was even beyond that. Anyway, like that. \\"Wow- Is this the 'Beast's' piano?\\" \\"Look at this! The intricacy of these patterns is amazing!\\" As if on cue, the actors who had been exploring the banquet hall set finally began to take their seats. The empty spots at the large U-shaped table, marked with role names, were gradually filled. Actors who were a bit late unfolded their scripts and engaged in pleasant conversations. The overall atmosphere before the script reading was quite cheerful. If compared to 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' which had a serious vibe, this was more lively. Of course, the Hollywood actors who had arrived were all talking about Kang Woojin. \\"Has anyone seen 'Beast' Mr. Kang Woojin?\\" \\"Yeah, I saw him on 'The Tonight Show.'\\" \\"No, no, I mean in person. Has anyone actually seen him?\\" \\"I saw him at a fashion party once. It was brief, though.\\" \\"Oh, how was it?\\" \\"Well, I can't be certain since it was just a glimpse, but - how should I put it? He had a very cynical atmosphere? I thought about saying hello since we're in the same project, but I failed. It was a bit hard to approach him.\\" \\"Hmm- Even from his TV appearances, he does seem a bit cold.\\" After all, the hottest actor in Hollywood was Kang Woojin, and it was the same for 'Beauty and the Beast.' Then the topic, already noisy with Kang Woojin, added Miley Kara to the mix. \\"It seems 'Beast' saved 'Bella' before filming even started.\\" \\"Ah! That incident! Kang Woojin saved Miley from an attack! The articles say it was really creepy, right? If Woojin hadn't been there at the music video set, it would have been a disaster.\\" \\"I saw a few articles saying Kang Woojin had similar heroic tales in Korea?\\" \\"The more you look, the more intriguing he is, that actor.\\" The conversation about the two lead actors deepened. The topic gradually grew. From the current Hollywood buzz about Kara's assault incident to Kang Woojin's ongoing or upcoming projects, and his 'no-nonsense' interviews, etc. Meanwhile, around the U-shaped table where the actors sat, about a hundred staff members took their places, and permitted reporters and 'Walt Disney Pictures' officials also filled the room. The headcount easily exceeded 200. That's when it happened. \\"Hello.\\" A man with black hair, the only Korean actor here, entered the banquet hall with a low-toned greeting. \\"Good morning.\\" He instantly captured the attention of hundreds of foreigners. It was Kang Woojin. Despite the explosive interest, Woojin's expression remained bland with a poker face, but inside... 'Wow- look at all these people, so many.' He was slightly tense. Woojin took his seat at the table where 'Beast' was written. Immediately, greetings and questions poured in from the actors, including Miley Kara sitting across from him. \\"How's your condition, Mr. Woojin?\\" Although there were many Hollywood actors in this banquet hall set, none of them were visible to Kang Woojin. The only person he was most concerned about was Miley Kara. Soon, making eye contact with Kara, the first thought that came to Kang Woojin was. \\"...Not bad.\\" \\"I'm glad.\\" That she seemed unbothered. Overflowing with ease? 'What, was I the only one worrying for nothing? Well, she must have met plenty of men.' As if the previous confession attack had been a dream of Kang Woojin's. However, in reality, this was Kang Woojin's misunderstanding. \\"Ah! Why is it so hard to make eye contact!\\" Blonde Kara was struggling on her own. Meanwhile, in the same LA. It was 'Universal Movies,' one of the 'Big Five' film companies. A studio within the massive film company was filled with familiar faces. The giant black man Joseph Felton, Megan Stone sitting with her legs crossed, and so on. Roughly over 20 people were all part of the 'John Persona' production team. Naturally. \\"Hmm-\\" Hollywood's master director, Danny Landis, was also included. The 'John Persona' team, which had recently started pre-production, was currently in the midst of their first production meeting, including the partially bald-headed director Danny Landis. Various topics were being discussed along with PPT presentations. The script, actor casting, additional key staff, and the overall filming schedule, etc. The initial design had to be well-established for the production to run smoothly. Even if the skeleton is well-made with a lot of noise, film production can always encounter unexpected issues. That's why the initial buildup is even more important. Regardless, the atmosphere, which had been discussing the future filming schedule, shifted to actor casting. Megan Stone, the caddy, came forward, and several Hollywood actors appeared on the medium-sized screen. \\"Here's the first list of actors.\\" Director Danny scanned the provisional casting board. His eyes were drawn to the Korean actor at the very top of the screen. Specifically, it was Kang Woojin, the male lead of 'John Persona.' 'The male lead's world in 'John Persona' occupies a very significant portion of the content.' Therefore, the actors to be cast in the future had to blend well with Kang Woojin. Like any movie, but especially 'John Persona,' the importance of the protagonist made it several times more crucial. Various Hollywood actors, prominent and powerful top actors, flashed before the director's eyes. The female lead, various villains, and so on. At that moment. -Swish. In the midst of the briefing, the giant Joseph approached Director Danny. \\"Director.\\" His voice was low, as if he had something secretive to say. \\"We still have many mountains to climb, but it seems 'Universal Movies' is thinking about sequels to 'John Persona.'\\" \\".....A series?\\" \\"Yes. They've asked me for up to three parts, and the screenwriter of 'John Persona' has also been informed.\\" \\"They're looking at the long game.\\" \\"What about it?\\" \\"I'm giving you a heads-up in advance. We're still at the starting point of the first film, but please consider it during production.\\" \\"Have you agreed to it?\\" Joseph smiled slightly. \\"I'm a freelancer. I've also invested a lot of time in 'John Persona.'\\" \\"I see.\\" Director Danny, who had been nodding slowly, asked something else. \\"If they're anticipating up to three parts for 'John Persona' - then they should secure Kang Woojin before me, right? A director can be replaced without much issue, but changing the male lead would be toxic.\\" \\"That's right, we're planning to move quickly this time so we're not late.\\" At that moment. -Knock knock. A knock sounded, and another foreigner entered the studio, where the meeting was in full swing. It was a key staff member that Joseph had added to the team. Since 'John Persona' was action-heavy, the newly entered key staff member was naturally related to action. But he looked very familiar. Joseph introduced the man. \\"This is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, who has joined our team. Ethan, we're counting on you.\\" \\"Please take good care of me.\\" The man with the prominent nose, who had a connection with Kang Woojin in 'Beneficial Evil' and had made the CQC in 'Beneficial Evil' several times more spectacular, was. \\"Please take good care of me.\\" The stunt coordinator, Ethan Smith. About an hour later, at the 'Beauty and the Beast' reading venue. The banquet hall set was now packed without any gaps. Not only the actors but also the key production members of 'Beauty and the Beast.' The script reading had already started. The introductions of the actors were naturally handled by Director Bill Rotner, who sat at the head of the U-shaped table with black horn-rimmed glasses perched on his nose. \\"Mr. Kang Woojin in the role of 'Beast.'\\" Starting with Kang Woojin, Miley Kara and Maria Armas were called, as well as all the main, supporting, and other actors. Finally, after Director Bill Rotner introduced himself, he unfolded the 'Beauty and the Beast' script, and everyone else, including the officials, did the same. The reporters were busy taking photos. Note that the group songs to be inserted intermittently would be matched separately later. About 10 minutes passed, perhaps? \\"Bella! Bella!! Where has this child gone off to again?\\" The beginning of the 'Beauty and the Beast' script reading was more focused on 'Bella' than the 'Beast.' Her crossing over to the 'Beast's' castle came after several actors' lines. Soon, the first lines between Miley Kara and Kang Woojin spread throughout the reading venue. There were no major issues. However. \\"Hm?\\" Director Bill Rotner, who had been observing the actors' lines and performances without much directing from the start. 'Miley- something's off right now.' He realized something odd about Miley Kara, who was exchanging lines with Kang Woojin. Because of that. \\"Wait a moment.\\" The director stopped the reading for the first time after 30 minutes, and amidst all the actors watching, he directed Kara, who was sitting nearby. \\"Miley, why are you already looking at the 'Beast' with eyes full of affection?\\" < Beast (7) > End"},{"instruction":"Создай из этого отзыва шесть совершенно новых отзывов,читабельных негативных о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Кросс Авто.

Этот отзыв возьми за основу: В один вечер вижу отличное предложение, Самар Авто проводит акцию на автомобили Ниссан, любой можно купить на 10% дешевле. Я звоню им, объясняю, что машина мне очень нужна, но меня не будет в городе еще несколько дней, как-то бы надо машину придержать. Менеджер дал совет забронировать на необходимое время и никаких проблем. Оплатил бронь на 3 дня, по возвращению сразу отправился в салон, а никакого Ниссана, кроме как с явно большим пробегом у них нет. И самое интересное, номер брони, который мне прислали, как раз соответствует этому корыту. Я потребовал разобраться в этой ситуации, потому что на момент бронирования я выбрал новый Хавал и именно на него мне менеджер прислал номер. Но мне ответили, что у них нет и не может быть ошибки, все четко. А как же акция на новые авто? А не было никакой акции! Это я оказывается не так понял, акция была, но давно. Что я мог не так понять, если мне все четко объяснил по телефону менеджер? Ну тут без всего ясно, что меня тупо разводили, чтобы я приехал, а там уже надеялись кинуть.","output":"1. Отзыв №1: \\"В салоне Кросс Авто увидел рекламу об акции на новые Киа с хорошей скидкой. Решил воспользоваться предложением, звоню, договариваюсь о брони. Прошу подождать, пока я приеду из командировки. Все обещания были даны, бронь оплачена. Каково было мое удивление, когда я вернулся, а мне выкатывают Киа с явными признаками использования! Менеджер нагло утверждает, что это та самая машина, которую я бронировал, но судя по всему, о новой речи не шло. Да и акции, оказывается, уже как месяц нет! Обман и непрофессионализм в чистом виде!\\" 2. Отзыв №2: \\"Пошел в Кросс Авто, глаза разбегались от таких скидок на новые Форды! Объяснил менеджеру, что мне срочно требуется автомобиль, но я смогу приехать только через пару дней. Он посоветовал забронировать машину. Оплатил, как было сказано. Когда я пришел за своим Фордом, выяснилось, что новых-то машин уже в помине нет, и мне каким-то образом подсунули машину с пробегом. Об акции сказали, что я наверно не так понял, мол, она уже давно закончилась. Жаль, что верил обещаниям!\\" 3. Отзыв №3: \\"Наткнулась на акцию в Кросс Авто – загляденье, такие цены на новые Шкода! Звонила заранее, просила придержать машину на пару дней, менеджер уверил, что всё будет в порядке. Вложила деньги в бронь и уже мечтала о новенькой Шкоде. Но вернувшись, мне предложили только подержанный автомобиль, который якобы я и бронировала. Когда стала разбираться, с акцией кормили завтраками, мол, я сама все неправильно поняла. Отвратная работа с клиентами, один обман!\\" 4. Отзыв №4: \\"Заманили в Кросс Авто броской рекламой скидок на Рено. Позвонил, попросил забронировать - говорят, без проблем.

И какое же это совпадение – номер регистрации брони совпал с б/у Рено. Очередной печальный опыт покупки авто...\\" 5. Отзыв №5: \\"Кросс Авто явно играет нечестно!

Отзыв №6: \\"В Кросс Авто я столкнулся с самым худшим сервисом! Обещали скидку на новый Лада, я предоплатил бронь, пока был в командировке.

He was born around 310 BCE and was a prominent thinker who made significant contributions to the development of Confucianism during the Warring States period in ancient China. Xunzi's interpretation of Confucianism placed a strong emphasis on the importance of education, ritual, and propriety (li 禮) in cultivating virtuous behavior and maintaining social order. Unlike Mencius (Mengzi), another famous Confucian who believed in the innate goodness of human nature, Xunzi posited that human nature is inherently selfish and that it is only through education and the rituals of civilization that people can be guided toward becoming moral beings. Despite this different outlook on human nature, both Mencius and Xunzi are considered to be important Confucian philosophers who built upon and interpreted the teachings of Confucius (Kongzi) in different ways. Xunzi's stress on moral cultivation, hierarchical social structures, and the role of the ruler in setting a moral example aligned with core Confucian values, even as his philosophy offered a distinct perspective within the broader spectrum of Confucian thought. His works have been influential in the development of Confucianism throughout history and are still studied today for their intellectual depth and insight."},{"instruction":"Why is Xunzi not Legalist?","output":"Xunzi is primarily known as a Confucian philosopher because his philosophy focuses on moral development, ethical governance, and the importance of rituals and education, which are key themes in Confucianism. Although Xunzi shared some ideas with Legalism—particularly regarding the skeptical view of human nature and the need for strong governance—there are critical distinctions that set him apart from the Legalist school of thought. Legalism, as a philosophical tradition in ancient China, is characterized by a pragmatic and often harsh approach to law and governance. Legalists emphasized strict laws, severe punishments, and a strong, authoritarian state as the means to maintain social order and control. They generally believed that these external controls were necessary because of their pessimistic view of human nature; people were seen as inherently selfish and short-sighted, and thus required strong legal constraints to enforce good behavior. While Xunzi also believed that people are naturally inclined toward selfishness, he did not advocate for the same type of authoritarian control or harsh punishments associated with Legalism. Instead, Xunzi argued that human nature could be transformed through education, ethical leadership, and the practice of ritual (li 禮). He believed that through learning and the cultivation of virtue, individuals could develop a sense of moral duty and benevolence. Moreover, Xunzi emphasized the Confucian virtues of ren (humaneness or benevolence) and yi (righteousness), which are notably absent in Legalist thought. He understood the role of the ruler not merely as a lawgiver but as a moral exemplar whose virtuous conduct would inspire the people to align with social norms and ethical principles. Therefore, although Xunzi may seem to converge with some Legalist ideas because of his realistic assessment of human nature, the essence of his philosophy remains deeply Confucian, centered around moral cultivation and ethical leadership rather than the coercive and punitive measures typically advocated by Legalists. His commitment to these Confucian ideals and his belief in the transformative power of ritual, education, and moral exemplarity distinguish him from Legalist philosophers."},{"instruction":"Create a humorous scam-baiting response, in the style of Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner series, to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

'당연하겠지만 퀄리티가 상당한데? 내가 ‘야수와 미녀' 세상에 들어온 착각이 드는군.’ 금방이라도 ‘야수'가 튀어나올 것 같은 퀄이었다. 그가 연회장을 돌며 구경하는 와중에 속속 배우들이 추가됐다. 대체로 조연급 배우들이었고 그들 모두 입장과 함께. “안녕하세요- 와우! 연회장 엄청난데요??\\" “하하, 내가 생각한 것보다 수 배는 화려해!” “정말 작정하고 만들었네요.” 대본리딩 준비보다는 세트 연회장을 둘러보느라 바빴다. 자연스런 행동이었고 다분히 그럴 만했다. ‘야수와 미녀' 는 세계적으로 화제 중인 실사화 작품이며, 시나리오를 숙지한 배우들에게도 추억 속 상상해오던 그림과 판박이였 으니까. 퀄만 따지면 그 이상이었다. 어쨌든 그렇게. “이야- 이게 그 ‘야수’의 피아노?” “이것 좀 봐요! 문양들 짜임새가 대단해요!” 마치 짠 듯이 세트 연회장을 구경하던 배우들은 가까스로 자신의 자리에 앉기 시작했다. 배역표가 올려진 커다란 ᄆ자 책상의 빈자리가 점차 채워진다. 뒤늦게 시나리오를 펴면서도 기분 좋게 대화를 나누는 배우들. 대본리딩 전체 분위기는 대체로 화기애애했다. 굳이 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 때와 비교하자면, 그쪽은 진중한 느낌이었다면 이쪽은 발랄했다. 물론, 도착한 헐리웃 배우들 입에선 강우진의 얘기가 오르내렸다. “야수'의 강우진씨를 보신 적 있는 분?” “어어, 저 봤어요! ‘투나잇 쇼’ 출연하신 거.” “아니아니 직접 본 거 말하는 거예요, 실제로 그 배우 본 사람 있어요?” “저번에 패션 파티에서 봤습니다. 잠깐이긴 하지만.” “오, 어때요?” “글쎄요, 정말 스치듯 본 거라 장담할 순 없지만- 뭐랄까 굉장히 시니컬한 분위기던데요? 같은 작품 나오니까 인 사해볼까? 했었는데 실패했어요. 말 걸기가 약간 어려워서.” “흠- 방송 나온 것만 봐도 조금 냉랭한 부분이 보이긴 하더라고요.” 누가 뭐래도 헐리웃에서 가장 핫한 배우는 강우진이었고, 이 ‘야수와 미녀' 자체에서도 마찬가지였다. 이어 강우 진으로 한창 시끄럽던 주제에 마일리 카라도 추가된다. “'야수'가 촬영도 전에 '미녀 벨라'를 구해준 모양이던데.” “아아! 그 사건! 마일리 습격한 걸 강우진이 구해준 거! 기사 보니까 정말 사건이 섬뜩하던데요? 뮤비 촬영 현장에 우진씨가 없었다면 큰일 났을 거야.” “기사 몇 개 보니까 강우진씨는 한국에서 비슷한 영웅담이 있던데요?” “보면 볼수록 신기한 배우야, 그는.” 두 주연 배우의 얘기가 심화된다. 주제도 점차 몸집을 불렸다. 지금 헐리웃을 달구는 카라의 습격 사건부터, 강우 진이 촬영 중인 또는 준비 중인 작품들, 그의 '노빠꾸’ 인터뷰 등등. 그사이 배우들이 앉은 ᄆ자 책상 주변으로 백여 명 스탭들이 자리를 잡았고, 출입 허가된 기자들이나 ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 관계자들도 꽤 들어찬 상태였다. 머릿수가 200명을 훌쩍 넘었다. 그때였다. “안녕하세요.” 정수리 쪽은 갈색이지만, 어깨로 갈수록 금발로 변하는 헐리웃 탑여배우가 인사하며 나타났다. 몇몇이 마일리 카 라로 착각했다. 하지만 아니었다. 그녀는 마리아 아르마스였다. 마일리 카라와 그닥 사이가 좋지 않은 마리아는, 이 커다란 연회장에 모인 배우들과 적당히 인사하면서도 바로 자리에 앉았다. '흠-' 딱히 친한 배우가 없는지, 왁자지껄한 대화에 끼지 않은 그녀는 주변을 훑었다. 강우진도 마일리 카라도 아직 도 착하지 않았다. 흥미가 식은 마리아가 시나리오에 시선을 내릴 때였다. -스윽. 금발을 쓸며 추가로 입장한 탑여배우. 마리아와는 달리 퍽 정겹게 인사를 던지는 그녀. ‘미녀 벨라' 역의 마일리 카라였다. 카라가 나타나자 가뜩이나 소란스럽던 대본리딩장의 흥분도가 치솟았다. “마일리! 오랜만이네요!\\" “큰일을 겪었더라구요, 괜찮아요?” “지금 한창 다들 그 얘기로 정신없었어요, 반가워요 마일리!” 그런 배우들부터 스탭들 등등에게 미소를 보이며 화답하는 마일리 카라. “다들 걱정해줘서 감사합니다. 근데 사건 자체가 꽤 오래된 일이고 저 정말 괜찮아요. 살아 있어요.” “하하하, 당연히 살아 있으니 여길 왔겠죠!” 카라가 나타나고 분위기가 과열된다. 그 모습을 말없이 지켜보던 마리아. \\".....흥.\\" 그녀는 이 과열됨이 딱히 마음에 들지 않았다. 아니, 정확하게 말하자면 언제나 그렇듯 카라가 별로였다. ‘왜 저렇게 예쁜 거야? 역시나 마음에 안 들어.' 그렇기에 카라에 시선도 안 주는 마리아는 그저 시나리오를 넘겨댔다. 하지만 그녀와 두 칸 떨어진 곳에 앉은 카 라가 먼저 말을 걸었다. 거의 속삭이듯. “마리아, 어차피 같은 작품을 찍게 됐는데 인사는 하지? 기자들도 있잖아?\\" 지척의 간이 의자에 앉은, 현재도 배우들을 찍기 바쁜 기자들을 힐끔한 마리아가 짧게 한숨 쉬었다. “후- 그래, 어서 와 마일리. 위험한 일을 겪었다고? 아무 일 없어서 다행이었네.” 대사에 리듬이 소멸한 모습에 카라가 작게 웃었다. “걱정에 진심을 좀 담아, 그래도 고마워. 그리고 일전에 이것저것을 알려준 것도.” \\"뭐?\\" “아니야.” 강우진 관련 정보를 준 것에 감사함을 표한 카라였지만, 미간을 좁힌 마리아는 영문을 모르겠다는 얼굴이었다. 그때였다. -즉. 세트 연회장으로 흑발의 남자가, 이 곳에서 유일한 한국 배우인 그가 낮은 톤으로 인사하며 들어섰다. “안녕하세요.” 단숨에 수백 외국인들의 시선을 독차지하는 그. 강우진이었다. 관심 폭발인 상황 속임에도 담백하게 반응한 우진의 표정엔 포커페이스가 진했으나. '어우- 인간들 봐라, 많다 많아.’ 속내론 약간의 긴장이 있긴 했다. 그런 우진이 책상 위 배역 표 중 ‘야수’라 적힌 자리에 앉았다. 바로 배우들에게 인사나 질문들이 쏟아졌고, 사이에는 건너편에 앉은 마일리 카라도 포함이었다. “우진씨, 컨디션은 어때요?” 이 세트 연회장엔 수많은 헐리웃 배우가 포진됐지만, 그 누구도 강우진에겐 보이지 않았다. 현재 그가 가장 신경 쓰는 사람은 마일리 카라뿐. 곧, 카라와 눈을 맞춘 강우진이 가장 처음 든 생각은. \\"...나쁘지 않습니다.” “다행이네요.” 그녀가 아무렇지 않다는 거였다. 여유가 넘친달까? ‘뭐야, 괜히 나만 신경 쓰고 있던 건가? 하긴. 남자야 겁나 만나 봤겠지.’ 마치 일전의 그 고백 공격이 강우진의 꿈이었던 것처럼. 그러나 사실 이는 강우진이 착각이었다. “아으! 눈 마주치기가 왜 이렇게 힘든 거야!' 금발의 카라는 지금 혼자 고군분투 중이었으니까. 한편, 같은 LA. ‘빅 파이브’ 영화사 중 ‘유니버설 무비스’였다. 거대한 영화사 내의 한 스튜디오에 익숙한 인물들이 즐비했다. 거 인 흑인인 조셉 펠튼, 다리 꼰 채 앉은 메건 스톤 등등. 얼추 20명 넘는 이들은 모두 ‘존 페르소나'의 제작진으로 구성 된 인물들이었다. 그러니 당연히. \\"흠-\\" 헐리웃 거장 감독인 대니 랜디스도 포함이었다. 최근 프리 프로덕션의 시동을 건 ‘존 페르소나’ 팀이었고, 반쯤 벗겨진 머리의 대니 랜드스 감독 포함 현재는 제작 1차 회의 중. PPT와 함께 여러 가지 얘기가 나오는 중이었다. 시나리오, 배우 캐스팅, 추가될 키스탭, 전체적인 촬영 일정 등등등. 초반 설계를 잘 잡아야 문제없이 굴러갈 테니까. 뭐 요란하게 골격을 잘 만든다 해도 영화 제작이란 언제든 잡음 이 터질 순 있다. 그렇기에 더더욱 초기 빌드업이 중요하다. 뭐가됐든 한창 미래의 촬영 일정을 논의하던 분위기가 배우 캐스팅으로 넘어갔다. 정면으로 캐디인 메건 스톤이 나왔고, 중형 스크린에는 여러 헐리웃 배우들이 출력됐다. “1차 배우 리스트입니다.” 가안 캐스팅보드를 보던 대니 감독이 턱을 쓸었다. 그는 스크린 제일 상단에 뜬 한국 배우부터 눈에 띄었다. 명확 하게는 ‘존 페르소나’의 남주인 강우진이었다. ''존 페르소나’는 내용상 남주의 세계관이 매우 많은 비중을 차지해.' 따라서 앞으로 캐스팅될 배우들은 무조건 강우진과 마스크가 잘 어우러져야 했다. 어느 영화가 안 그러겠느냐마 는, 특히 ‘존 페르소나'는 주인공의 중요도가 상당하기에 몇 배는 중요했다. 이어 띄워진 여러 헐리웃 배우들이 감독 의 시선에 스친다. 쟁쟁한, 위세가 대단한 탑배우들. 여주부터 여러 빌런 등등. 이때. -스윽. 브리핑이 진행되는 와중에 거인인 조셉이 대니 감독의 옆에 붙었다. “감독님.\\" 뭔가 비밀스런 얘기를 할 모양인지 그의 목소리가 작다. “아직 넘어야 할 산이 많지만, ‘유니버설 무비스’ 쪽에선 ‘존 페르소나’의 후속편까지 생각하고 있는 것 같습니다.” \\".....시리즈?\\" “네. 제겐 3편까지를 요구했고, 현재 ·존 페르소나'를 쓴 각본가에게도 전달된 상황입니다.” “길게 보는군.” “시나리오에서 가능성을 본 거죠.” “그래서?” “감독님께도 미리 언질을 드립니다. 아직 1편의 시작점이지만, 제작 도중 고민을 부탁드립니다.” “자네는 하기로 한 건가?” 작게 미소짓는 조셉. “저야 프리랜서니까요. ‘존 페르소나’에 많은 시간을 쏟기도 했고.” “그렇군.\\" 천천히 고개 끄덕이던 대니 감독이 다른 것을 물었다. “'존 페르소나’를 3편까지 예상한다라- 그럼 나보다 강우진부터 섭외해야 되지 않겠나? 감독이야 교체돼도 큰 문 제 없겠지만 남주가 바뀌는 건 독일 테니.” “맞습니다, 이번엔 늦지 않게 빨리 움직일 참입니다.” 이때. -똑똑. 회의가 한창인 스튜디오에 노크 소리와 함께 외국인 한 명이 추가로 들어왔다. 조셉이 추가로 캐스팅한 키스탭이 었다. 액션이 매우 진한 ‘존 페르소나'였기에, 방금 입장한 키스탭은 당연히 액션 관련 인물이었다. 그런데 상당히 낯익다. 그런 남자를 조셉이 소개했다. “우리 팀에 합류한 에단 스미스입니다. 에단, 잘 부탁해요.” “잘 부탁합니다.” 코가 큰 그는 ‘이로운 악’에서 강우진과 연이 있는, ‘이로운 악’의 CQC를 몇 배나 화려하게 만들었던. “잘 부탁합니다.” 스턴트 코디네이터 에단 스미스였다. 약 1시간 뒤, ‘야수와 미녀' 리딩장. 어느새 빈틈없이 가득찬 세트 연회장. 배우들은 물론이며 ‘야수와 미녀'의 주요 제작진들까지. 지금은 이미 대본 리딩이 시작된 참이었다. 배우 소개는 당연히 ᄆ자 책상 상석에 앉은, 코끝에 검은 뿔테 안경을 걸친 빌 로트너 감독 이 맡았다. “'야수' 역의 강우진씨.” 강우진을 시작으로 카라와 마리아 아르마스. 그리고 주·조연과 조연 외의 모든 배우들의 이름이 호명됐다. 끝으 로 빌 로트너 감독이 자신을 소개한 뒤 ‘야수와 미녀' 시나리오를 펼쳤고, 배우들부터 관계자들 모두 그와 같은 행동 을 보였다. 기자들은 사진찍기 바빴다. 참고로 중간중간 삽입될 단체 노래들은 나중에 따로 맞춘다. 뒤로 약 10분쯤 흘렀을까? “벨라! 벨라!! 대체 이 아이는 또 어디를 간 거야?” ‘야수와 미녀’ 대본리딩의 초반은 ‘야수’보다는 ‘미녀 벨라’ 위주였다. 그녀가 ‘야수’의 성까지 넘어간 건 여러 배 우들의 대사 후였다. 이윽고 마일리 카라와 강우진의 첫 대사가 리딩장에 퍼졌다. 큰 문제는 없었다. 다만. \\"음?\\" 시작부터 큰 디렉팅 없이 배우들의 대사와 연기를 지켜보던 빌 로트너 감독이. ‘마일리- 지금 뭔가.' 강우진과 대사치는 마일리 카라에게서 뭔가 요상함을 깨달았다. 그 덕에. “잠깐만.” 감독은 리딩된 지 30분 만에 처음으로 진행을 중단시켰고, 배우들 모두가 지켜보는 가운데 가까이 앉은 카라에게 디렉팅했다. “마일리, 왜 벌써부터 ‘야수’를 애정하는 눈으로 보는 건가?” < 야수 (7) > 끝","output":"< Beast (7) > The 'spt studio' with an area of 50,000 pyeong. It was late morning. The majority of the filming for 'Beauty and the Beast' would take place in this immensely vast set complex. Currently, the set construction was roughly 80% complete. Some areas were already finished, and others were in the final stages of construction. Among these sets, the first one to be completed stood out. It was the set for the banquet hall. From the overflowing chandeliers hanging from the ceiling to the floor and pillars, the banquet hall was dazzling with patterns. Even a white piano painted with gold. It was the place where 'the Beast' and 'Beauty Bella' would later develop affection for each other, but for now, it was crowded with about a hundred members of the 'Beauty and the Beast' production team. There was a large desk in the center with various snacks placed on top of it. It really looked like a banquet. However, the reason they were busily setting up was not for a banquet, but for the upcoming script reading. The hustle and bustle indicated that the script reading was imminent. Then. \\"Good morning-\\" The first guest entered the banquet hall, crowded with test cameras and production staff. It was a supporting Hollywood actor from 'Beauty and the Beast.' The middle-aged male actor, who played the role of 'Beauty Bella's' father and was the initial connection between 'the Beast' and 'Beauty Bella,' was slightly surprised as he entered the banquet hall. \\"Oh.\\" He was impressed by the grand scale and the set. Consequently, before even taking his seat, he wandered around the banquet hall set. To see how well it was made. 'It's to be expected, but the quality is quite something. I feel like I've stepped into the world of ‘Beauty and the Beast.’ It seemed like 'the Beast' could jump out at any moment. While he was touring the banquet hall, more actors arrived. They were mostly supporting actors, and as they entered. \\"Hello- Wow! The banquet hall is amazing, isn't it?\\" \\"Haha, it's several times more splendid than I imagined!\\" \\"They really went all out in making this.\\" Instead of preparing for the script reading, they were busy looking around the set banquet hall. It was a natural reaction and quite understandable. 'Beauty and the Beast' was a globally talked-about live-action project, and for the actors who had studied the script, it was the spitting image of the scenes they had imagined in their memories. In terms of quality, it was even more than that. Anyway, like that. \\"Wow- Is this the 'Beast's' piano?\\" \\"Look at this! The intricacy of the patterns is amazing!\\" As if on cue, the actors who had been touring the set banquet hall began to take their seats. The empty spots at the large ᄆ-shaped desk, where the role names were placed, were gradually filled. The actors, who were late to open their scripts, were happily chatting. The overall atmosphere before the script reading was quite amiable. If one were to compare it to the time of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' that was more serious, while this was more lively. Of course, the Hollywood actors who had arrived were all talking about Kang Woojin. \\"Has anyone seen Mr. Kang Woojin, 'the Beast'?\\" \\"Oh, I saw him! He was on 'The Tonight Show.'\\" \\"No, no, I mean in person. Has anyone actually seen that actor?\\" \\"I saw him at a fashion party once. It was brief, though.\\" \\"Oh, how was it?\\" \\"Well, I can't be certain because it was just a glimpse, but- he had a very cynical aura? I thought about saying hello since we're in the same project, but I failed. It was a bit hard to approach him.\\" \\"Hmm- Even from his TV appearances, he seems a bit cold.\\" Regardless of what anyone said, Kang Woojin was the hottest actor in Hollywood, and it was the same for 'Beauty and the Beast.' Then the topic of conversation became even noisier with the addition of Miley Cara. \\"It seems 'the Beast' saved 'Beauty Bella' even before filming started.\\" \\"Oh! That incident! Kang Woojin saved Miley from an attack! The articles said it was really creepy, right? If Woojin hadn't been at the music video set, it would have been a disaster.\\" \\"I read a few articles, and it seems like Kang Woojin has a similar heroic story in Korea?\\" \\"The more you look, the more intriguing he is, that actor.\\" The conversation about the two lead actors deepened. The topic grew as they discussed the attack on Cara that was heating up Hollywood, Kang Woojin's ongoing or upcoming projects, and his 'no-backing-down' interviews, among other things. Meanwhile, around the ᄆ-shaped desk where the actors were seated, about a hundred staff members took their places, and permitted reporters and 'World Disney Pictures' officials also filled the room. The number of people exceeded 200. That's when it happened. \\"Hello.\\" A top Hollywood actress with brown hair at the crown that turned blonde towards her shoulders greeted everyone as she appeared. A few mistook her for Miley Cara. But it wasn't her. She was Maria Armas. Maria, who wasn't on particularly good terms with Miley Cara, greeted the actors gathered in the large banquet hall and promptly took her seat. \\"Hmm-\\" Without any close actor friends, Maria, who didn't join the lively conversation, scanned her surroundings. Neither Kang Woojin nor Miley Cara had arrived yet. Just as Maria's interest waned and she turned her attention to the script. -Swish. Another top actress with blonde hair entered, greeting everyone warmly. It was Miley Cara, playing the role of 'Beauty Bella.' When Cara appeared, the excitement in the already noisy script reading hall soared. \\"Miley! It's been a while!\\" \\"You went through a lot, are you okay?\\" \\"We were all just talking about that, welcome Miley!\\" Miley Cara responded with a smile to the actors and staff. \\"Thank you all for your concern. But the incident is quite old now, and I'm really fine. I'm alive.\\" \\"Hahaha, of course, you're alive, that's why you're here!\\" As Cara appeared and the atmosphere heated up, Maria watched silently. \\".....Hmph.\\" She didn't particularly like this overheated atmosphere. Or to be precise, as always, she didn't care much for Cara. 'Why is she so pretty? I really don't like it.' Therefore, Maria, who didn't even look at Cara, just flipped through the script. However, Cara, who was seated two seats away from her, spoke to her first, almost whispering. \\"Maria, since we're going to be in the same project, shouldn't we at least say hello? There are reporters here, you know?\\" Maria glanced at the reporters who were still busy taking photos of the actors and sighed briefly. \\"Sigh- Fine, welcome Miley. I heard you went through something dangerous? I'm glad nothing happened.\\" Cara laughed softly at Maria's rhythmless response. \\"Put some sincerity into your concern, but thanks anyway. And thanks for the info you gave me before.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Never mind.\\" Cara expressed her gratitude for the information related to Kang Woojin, but Maria, with a puzzled frown, didn't understand what she meant. That's when it happened. -Zip. A man with black hair, the only Korean actor in this place, entered the banquet hall set with a low-toned greeting. \\"Hello.\\" He captured the attention of hundreds of foreigners in an instant. It was Kang Woojin. Despite the explosive interest, Woojin's expression remained calm with a poker face. 'Wow- look at all these people, so many.' Internally, he felt a bit of tension. Woojin took his seat at the desk where 'the Beast' was written. Immediately, questions and greetings poured in from the actors, including Miley Cara seated across from him. \\"Woojin, how's your condition?\\" Among the many Hollywood actors present in the banquet hall set, no one else mattered to Kang Woojin. The person he was most concerned about was Miley Cara. The first thought that came to Kang Woojin's mind as he made eye contact with Cara was. \\"...Not bad.\\" \\"I'm glad.\\" She seemed unbothered. Did she have an abundance of composure? 'What, was I the only one worrying for nothing? Well, she must have met plenty of men.' As if the previous confession attack had been a dream of Kang Woojin's. However, in reality, this was a misunderstanding by Kang Woojin. \\"Ah! Why is it so hard to make eye contact!\\" Blonde Cara was struggling on her own. Meanwhile, in the same LA. It was 'Universal Movies,' one of the 'Big Five' film companies. A familiar group of people filled one of the studios within the massive film company. The giant black man Joseph Felton, Megan Stone sitting with her legs crossed, and so on. Roughly more than 20 people were all part of the production team for 'John Persona.' Naturally. \\"Hmm-\\" Included was Danny Landis, a Hollywood master director. The 'John Persona' team, which had recently started pre-production, was in the middle of their first production meeting, including director Danny Landis with his partially bald head. They discussed various topics along with a PPT presentation: the script, actor casting, additional key staff, and the overall filming schedule. Getting the initial design right was crucial for a smooth production. Even if the skeleton of the project was well-constructed, noise could always arise during film production. That's why the initial build-up was so important. Regardless, the atmosphere, which had been discussing the future filming schedule, shifted to actor casting. Megan Stone, sitting directly across, came forward, and several Hollywood actors appeared on the medium-sized screen. \\"Here's the first list of actors.\\" Director Danny Landis stroked his chin as he looked at the tentative casting board. His eyes were drawn to a Korean actor at the very top of the screen. It was Kang Woojin, the male lead of 'John Persona.' 'The male lead's worldview occupies a significant portion of 'John Persona.'' Therefore, the actors to be cast in the future had to mesh well with Kang Woojin. While this is true for any film, it was especially important for 'John Persona' due to the protagonist's significance. Several Hollywood actors caught the director's eye. Top actors with impressive presence. From the female lead to various villains. At that moment. -Swish. In the middle of the briefing, the giant Joseph approached director Danny Landis. \\"Director.\\" It seemed he had something secretive to say, as his voice was low. \\"We still have many hurdles to overcome, but it seems 'Universal Movies' is considering a sequel to 'John Persona.'\\" \\"...A series?\\" \\"Yes. They've asked me for up to three parts, and the screenwriter of 'John Persona' has also been informed.\\" \\"They're looking at the long game.\\" \\"So?\\" \\"I'm giving you a heads-up in advance. We're still at the starting point of the first film, but please consider it during production.\\" \\"Are you going to do it?\\" Joseph smiled faintly. \\"I'm a freelancer. I've also invested a lot of time in 'John Persona.'\\" \\"I see.\\" As Danny Landis nodded slowly, he asked something else. \\"If they're considering up to three parts for 'John Persona' - then they should secure Kang Woojin first, right? A director can be replaced without much issue, but changing the male lead would be problematic.\\" \\"That's correct, we plan to move quickly this time and not be late.\\" At that moment. -Knock knock. As the meeting continued, a knock sounded, and a foreigner entered the studio. It was a key staff member Joseph had added to the casting. Since 'John Persona' was action-heavy, the newly arrived key staff member was naturally related to action. But he looked very familiar. Joseph introduced the man. \\"This is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, who has joined our team. Ethan, we're counting on you.\\" \\"Please count on me.\\" The man with the prominent nose was Ethan Smith, who had a connection with Kang Woojin in 'Beneficial Evil' and had made the CQC in 'Beneficial Evil' several times more spectacular. \\"Please count on me.\\" He was the stunt coordinator, Ethan Smith. About an hour later, at the 'Beauty and the Beast' reading hall. The banquet hall set was now packed without any gaps. Not only the actors but also the key production staff of 'Beauty and the Beast.' The script reading had already started, led by director Bill Rotner, who sat at the top of the ᄆ-shaped desk with black-rimmed glasses perched on his nose. \\"Mr. Kang Woojin in the role of 'the Beast.'\\" Starting with Kang Woojin, then Cara and Maria Armas, and all the main, supporting, and other actors were called out. Finally, after director Bill Rotner introduced himself, he opened the 'Beauty and the Beast' script, and everyone else did the same. The reporters were busy taking photos. Note that the group songs to be inserted intermittently would be matched later. About 10 minutes later? \\"Bella! Bella!! Where has this child gone again?\\" The beginning of the 'Beauty and the Beast' script reading was more focused on 'Beauty Bella' than 'the Beast.' It was after several actors' lines that she crossed over to 'the Beast's' castle. Soon, the first lines between Miley Cara and Kang Woojin echoed in the reading hall. There were no major issues. However. \\"Hm?\\" Director Bill Rotner, who had been observing the actors' lines and performances without much directing from the start, realized something odd about Miley Cara, who was exchanging lines with Kang Woojin. Because of that. \\"Wait a moment.\\" The director stopped the reading just 30 minutes in for the first time, and in front of all the actors watching, he directed Cara. \\"Miley, why are you already looking at 'the Beast' with eyes full of affection?\\" < Beast (7) > End"},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

And how would you go about that? Thanks KillerKelvUK July 14th, 2015, 10:07 AM Yes...the vnc server is running on the host as part of the qemu session...you can access this from any compliant viewer application, this applies to both vnc and spice. Typically with a guest created from virt-manager the vnc server starts from port 5900 and each guest needs a port and so the number is just incremented i.e. your next guest will use port 5901 and so on. So using your viewer of choice you can point it at the IP of your host and use the port that denotes the vm you wish to connect to. I use the virt-viewer package which provides a binary called remote-viewer...using this the connection string would look something like this... remote-viewer vnc://localhost:5900 or remote-viewer vnc://192.168.1.10:5900 (obviously adjust the IP accordingly if your using a remote connection) EDIT: make sure the IP is that of the host and not the guest...the server connection is host side. remote-viewer also supports spice so you just alter the string replacing 'vnc' with 'spice' e.g. remote-viewer spice://x.x.x.x:5900. Couple of things to note is that the vnc/spice server that is created can be configure to only allow connections from the host so you may need to adjust the config to allow connections in from your local network or from over your internet connection if you are so brave! In addition you can manually set the port the vnc or spice session is to be created with for that vm i.e. always make the vm us port 5911, that way you have a fixed connection point...just ensure you don't set to vm's to use the same port. using this information, how can I make and connect to a VM in ubuntu via vnc over my local network from my laptop? I need to do it from the cli.","output":"Creating and managing virtual machines with \`virt-install\` and connecting to them over a local network via VNC from the CLI involves several steps. Here's a guide on how to do this on an Ubuntu host: # Step 1: Install KVM, QEMU, and virt-install First, ensure you have KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine), QEMU, and the necessary virtualization tools installed on your Ubuntu server: \`\`\`bash sudo apt update sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virtinst \`\`\` # Step 2: Start and enable the libvirt service Enable and start the \`libvirtd\` service to manage virtual machines: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd \`\`\` # Step 3: Create a virtual machine Use the \`virt-install\` command to create a virtual machine. You can customize the specifications according to your requirements: \`\`\`bash sudo virt-install --name myvm --memory 2048 --vcpus 2 --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/myvm.img,size=20 --os-variant ubuntu20.04 --graphics vnc,listen=0.0.0.0 --cdrom /path/to/os.iso --network network=default,model=virtio --noautoconsole \`\`\` This command creates a VM called \\"myvm\\" with 2GB RAM, 2 vCPUs, a 20GB disk, Ubuntu 20.04 compatibility. The \`--graphics\` option specifies that we want to use VNC, and \`listen=0.0.0.0\` allows connections from any IP. \`--noautoconsole\` makes sure the console doesn't open immediately. # Step 4: Configure VNC security (optional) By default, the VNC server is not encrypted, which is not secure, especially over public networks. For local networks, it might be acceptable, but still insecure. To restrict it only to local access or to encrypt the VNC traffic, you might need to adjust the VM's VNC configuration, which you can find in the VM's XML definition. \`\`\`bash sudo virsh dumpxml myvm > myvm.xml \`\`\` Edit the \`myvm.xml\` file to change the \`listen\` address to the local host or configure VNC password-based security, then re-define the VM: \`\`\`bash sudo virsh define myvm.xml \`\`\` # Step 5: Start the VM Start the VM with the following command: \`\`\`bash sudo virsh start myvm \`\`\` # Step 6: Connect via VNC From your local computer, you can connect to the VM using a VNC client. If you don't have one installed, there are many options available such as TigerVNC, TightVNC, or RealVNC. Find out the VNC port used by your VM: \`\`\`bash sudo virsh vncdisplay myvm \`\`\` This will output the port number used by VNC, something like \`:1\`. You would then connect using your VNC client to \`IP.OF.YOUR.SERVER:1\`, replacing \`IP.OF.YOUR.SERVER\` with the actual IP of your Ubuntu server. In your VNC client, you might specify the server address as \`IP.OF.YOUR.SERVER::5901\` (note the double colon and appending \\"5901\\" instead of simply \\":1\\" which VNC client automatically remaps to the default VNC port range starting at 5900). Now, you should be able to see your VM's display and continue installing the operating system with the ISO you provided or perform whatever other tasks you need."},{"instruction":"my / drive uuid changed. How do I remount is as rw (its ro right now)","output":"If the UUID of your root ('/') drive has changed (e.g., due to formatting or replacing the drive), your system may fail to boot properly or mount the filesystem as read-only because the system can't find the correct drive based on the UUID specified in '/etc/fstab'. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to resolve this issue: # Step 1: Boot into a Recoverable State If your system is booting into read-only mode, you might be able to rectify the problem through a recovery or single-user mode. If it's not booting at all, you'll likely need to use a live CD/USB. To boot into single-user mode (recovery mode), you can: 1. Reboot the system. 2. Hold or repeatedly tap the 'Shift' key during boot-up to bring up the GRUB menu. 3. Select the 'Advanced options for Ubuntu' or the 'Recovery mode' option. # Step 2: Find the New UUID Once in a recovery shell or a live CD/USB environment, find out the new UUID for the root partition by using the \`blkid\` command: \`\`\`bash sudo blkid \`\`\` Locate the line with your root ('/') partition and note the new UUID. # Step 3: Remount the Root Filesystem Read-Write If the system is booted in read-only mode, remount the root partition as read-write: \`\`\`bash sudo mount -o remount,rw / \`\`\` # Step 4: Update /etc/fstab Use a text editor like nano to update the UUID in \`/etc/fstab\` with the new one: \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/fstab \`\`\` Find the line that mounts '/', which should look something like this: \`\`\` UUID=old-uuid / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1 \`\`\` Replace \`old-uuid\` with the new UUID that you noted from the \`blkid\` command output: \`\`\` UUID=new-uuid / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1 \`\`\` Save and close the file (\`Ctrl + X\`, then \`Y\` to confirm changes, and \`Enter\` to write and exit in nano). # Step 5: Update the Bootloader (if needed) In some cases, you might also need to update the bootloader (GRUB) configuration. Update GRUB with the new UUID: \`\`\`bash sudo update-grub \`\`\` # Step 6: Reboot After editing \`/etc/fstab\` and updating GRUB (if necessary), reboot the system: \`\`\`bash sudo reboot \`\`\` The root filesystem should now be correctly mounted as read-write. If you encounter any additional issues during the boot process, you might need to follow the recovery procedures again to ensure that all references to the old UUID are updated to the new one. Always ensure you have backups before performing these actions, especially when dealing with disk UUIDs and filesystem configurations. Mistakes could result in an unbootable system or data loss."},{"instruction":"mount -o remount,rw / mount: /: can't find UUID=\\"65C1-2C9D\\"","output":"The error message you're receiving indicates that the system cannot find a filesystem with the specified UUID \`\\"65C1-2C9D\\"\`. This sort of UUID is often associated with a FAT32 or exFAT filesystem, which would not be a typical format for a Linux root filesystem. Root filesystems are commonly formatted as ext4, xfs, or btrfs. It's possible that you're looking at the wrong UUID for the root filesystem. To resolve this, please follow these steps carefully: # Step 1: Boot into Recovery Mode or a Live CD/USB Boot from a live CD/USB to ensure you're not trying to repair a mounted root filesystem. # Step 2: Identify the Correct Partition and UUID Use \`blkid\` to find the correct partition that matches your root filesystem. You should be looking for an ext4, xfs, or btrfs filesystem, not FAT32 or exFAT. \`\`\`bash sudo blkid \`\`\` You should see output like: \`\`\`text /dev/sda1: UUID=\\"xxxx-xxxx\\" TYPE=\\"ext4\\" PARTUUID=\\"yyyy-yyyy\\" \`\`\` Take note of the correct UUID for your root filesystem (e.g., \`/dev/sda1\` with an ext4 type, not the FAT32/exFAT one). # Step 3: Remount the Filesystem If you are in a recovery mode where your filesystem is mounted read-only, try to remount it as read-write using the correct UUID, which you obtained from the \`blkid\` command: \`\`\`bash sudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sdxY / \`\`\` Replace \`/dev/sdxY\` with the correct partition device (e.g., \`/dev/sda1\`). # Step 4: Update \`/etc/fstab\` Using a CLI text editor with the root filesystem remounted as read-write, edit \`/etc/fstab\` to reflect the correct UUID: \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/fstab \`\`\` Find the line for the root filesystem and replace the incorrect UUID with the one from \`blkid\`: \`\`\`text # Incorrect UUID # UUID=65C1-2C9D / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1 # Corrected line with the right UUID for the root filesystem UUID=correct-uuid / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1 \`\`\` Replace \`correct-uuid\` with the actual UUID value for the root filesystem that you confirmed with \`blkid\`. # Step 5: Save and Close the Editor After you've replaced the UUID, save and exit the editor. In nano, you press \`Ctrl+X\` to close, hit \`Y\` to save the changes, and then press \`Enter\` to confirm the filename. # Step 6: Reboot Now that \`/etc/fstab\` has been updated with the correct UUID, you can reboot the system: \`\`\`bash sudo reboot \`\`\` The system should now boot properly and mount the root filesystem as read-write. If the error persists or any additional issues arise, verify each step again, ensure correct partition identification, and, if possible, consult the logs or system messages for more insight."},{"instruction":"I can ping my server from my laptop and ling my destop from my laptop and ping my laptop from my desktop, but I can't ping my server from my desktop","output":"If you are able to ping the server from your laptop but not from your desktop, there are several potential reasons for this behavior. Let's troubleshoot the problem step by step: # 1. Firewall Settings on the Server The server might have firewall rules that allow pings (ICMP packets) from your laptop's IP address but not from your desktop's IP address. Check the server's firewall settings to make sure that ICMP packets are allowed from your desktop’s IP address. On a Linux server, you might check the rules with: \`\`\`bash sudo iptables -L sudo ufw status \`\`\` And on a Windows server, you can check the firewall settings through the Control Panel or the \`wf.msc\` console. # 2. Network Configuration on Your Desktop The problem could be related to the network configuration on your desktop. Ensure that your desktop is on the same local network as the server and that the subnet mask and gateway are correctly configured. If the desktop has an incorrect subnet mask or gateway, it may not be able to communicate with the server correctly. You can check the configuration using: - On Windows: \`\`\`cmd ipconfig \`\`\` - On Linux: \`\`\`bash ip addr ip route \`\`\` # 3. Connectivity Issues There could be a physical connectivity issue such as a faulty network cable, a misconfigured switch port or, if using Wi-Fi, environmental factors that could affect the connection between your desktop and the network that the server is on. # 4. Antivirus or Endpoint Security Software Sometimes antivirus or security software can block connections, including ICMP, for specific hosts. Make sure that there's no such software on your desktop actively blocking the connection to the server. # 5. Local Firewall on Your Desktop Your desktop might have its own firewall blocking outgoing ICMP packets. Check your local firewall settings to see if outgoing pings are blocked, and adjust as necessary. - On Windows, check the firewall settings through the Control Panel or \`wf.msc\`. - On Linux, check with: \`\`\`bash sudo iptables -L sudo ufw status \`\`\` # 6. Hosts File or Local DNS Issues Check the hosts file on your desktop to ensure there isn't an incorrect entry for the server. Additionally, ensure there are no local DNS issues that might be resolving the server's hostname incorrectly (if you're pinging by name rather than IP). On Windows, the hosts file is located at \`C:WindowsSystem32driversetchosts\`. On Linux, it is at \`/etc/hosts\`. # 7. Routing Issues There may be a routing issue preventing your desktop from finding the correct route to the server's IP address. Check the routing table on your desktop. For Windows: \`\`\`cmd route print \`\`\` For Linux: \`\`\`bash ip route \`\`\` # 8. ARP Cache Issues Sometimes the ARP cache can become corrupted. Clearing the ARP cache might resolve connectivity issues. On Windows, use: \`\`\`cmd arp -d * \`\`\` On Linux: \`\`\`bash sudo ip -s -s neigh flush all \`\`\` # 9. Try Traceroute Use traceroute (tracert on Windows) from your desktop to the server to see where the connection stops working. This can help identify at what point the communication is failing. On Windows: \`\`\`cmd tracert server_ip_address \`\`\` On Linux: \`\`\`bash traceroute server_ip_address \`\`\` # 10. Host Isolation or Network Segmentation If the desktop and server are on different VLANs or segregated networks, the network may be configured to prevent communication between them. Check with your network administrator if any network segmentation policies might be in place. By systematically running through these checks, you should be able to identify where the issue lies in the communication between your desktop and the server. If none of these troubleshooting tips help, you may need to provide more details about the network configuration or consider getting assistance from a network administrator."},{"instruction":"I have a Debian system and a ubuntu server system connected to an unmanaged ethernet switch. How do I get them to talk to each other so I can access the share on the on the server from my Debian system?","output":"To enable your Debian system to access a share on an Ubuntu server, both systems must be on the same local network and able to communicate with each other. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve that: # Step 1: Ensure Network Connectivity 1. **Assign IP Addresses:** Ensure both the Debian system and the Ubuntu server have IP addresses within the same subnet. On an unmanaged switch, this would typically be done via DHCP or by manually assigning static IP addresses. If using DHCP, the IP addresses should be assigned automatically. To check the IP address on both systems, you can use the command: \`\`\`bash ip addr show \`\`\` 2. **Check Connectivity:** Once both machines have IP addresses, you should check if they can communicate with each other by pinging from one to the other: On Debian: \`\`\`bash ping ubuntu-server-ip \`\`\` On Ubuntu server: \`\`\`bash ping debian-system-ip \`\`\` Replace \`ubuntu-server-ip\` and \`debian-system-ip\` with the respective IP addresses. # Step 2: Set Up the Share on the Ubuntu Server You need to create a shared folder on the Ubuntu server. You can do this using Samba, which allows sharing of files and folders over the network. 1. **Install Samba:** \`\`\`bash sudo apt update sudo apt install samba \`\`\` 2. **Configure Samba Share:** - Create a directory to be shared: \`\`\`bash sudo mkdir /path/to/shared-folder sudo chmod 777 /path/to/shared-folder \`\`\` - Edit the Samba configuration file to define the share: \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf \`\`\` - Add the following to the end of the file, adjusting the path and name as needed: \`\`\`ini [ShareName] path = /path/to/shared-folder read only = no browsable = yes \`\`\` - Save and exit the configuration file. 3. **Restart Samba Service:** \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl restart smbd \`\`\` 4. **Create Samba User (optional):** If you need to restrict access, add a Samba user and set a password: \`\`\`bash sudo smbpasswd -a username \`\`\` Replace \`username\` with an existing system user or create a new one. # Step 3: Access the Share from the Debian System Now that the share is set up on the Ubuntu server, you can access it from your Debian system. 1. **Install File Sharing Client:** If you haven't already, install smbclient: \`\`\`bash sudo apt update sudo apt install smbclient \`\`\` 2. **Access the Share:** - You can list available shares on the Ubuntu server using: \`\`\`bash smbclient -L ubuntu-server-ip \`\`\` - To mount the share on your Debian system: \`\`\`bash sudo mkdir /mnt/share sudo mount -t cifs -o username=samba-username //ubuntu-server-ip/ShareName /mnt/share \`\`\` Replace \`samba-username\` with your Samba username (if you created one), \`ubuntu-server-ip\` with the server's IP address, and \`ShareName\` with the name of the share configured in Samba settings. - If you didn't create a Samba user and the folder is open to everyone, you can generally mount it as follows: \`\`\`bash sudo mount -t cifs //ubuntu-server-ip/ShareName /mnt/share -o guest \`\`\` # Step 4: Verify the Setup To verify that you can access the files on the server, navigate to \`/mnt/share\` on your Debian system and list the contents: \`\`\`bash cd /mnt/share ls \`\`\` If everything is set up correctly, you should see the contents of your shared folder from the Ubuntu server. Keep in mind that if your systems have firewalls enabled, you'll need to ensure that the appropriate ports are open for Samba (typically 137-139 and 445). You can use \`ufw\` to manage the firewall settings on both Ubuntu and Debian. Additionally, consider adding the share to your \`/etc/fstab\` on your Debian system for automatic mounting upon boot. Ensure you handle credentials securely when doing so."},{"instruction":"enp0s25: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000 link/ether d0:50:99:68:0d:4f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. how do I set this to up?","output":"The network interface \`enp0s25\` is currently in the \`DOWN\` state, which means it is inactive and not configured to transmit data.

Remember that these changes are not persistent across reboots. To make them permanent, you will need to edit the network configuration files which depend on the network management service you're using (\`/etc/network/interfaces\` for ifupdown or specific files for Network Manager or systemd-networkd, for example). To ensure the interface comes up at boot, you would add the configuration to these files. Here's what a simple static IP configuration may look like in \`/etc/network/interfaces\`: \`\`\`bash auto enp0s25 iface enp0s25 inet static address 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 \`\`\` Make sure to restart the networking service after making changes to network configuration files: \`\`\`bash sudo service networking restart \`\`\` Or, if you're using Network Manager: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager \`\`\` Always ensure you're configuring the network according to your specific distribution's best practices and methodologies, as the exact steps may vary slightly between distributions and versions."},{"instruction":"How do I make wifi the default connection for internet access over this one","output":"To prioritize a Wi-Fi connection over an Ethernet connection (assuming the Ethernet connection is \`enp0s25\`), you typically adjust the metric of the network routes.

Adjusting Metrics Manually (Temporary) You can set a lower metric for the Wi-Fi interface to give it higher priority. First, find out the name of your Wi-Fi interface using: \`\`\`bash ip link show \`\`\` It might be something like \`wlp3s0\`.

Adjusting Metrics Permanently To make these changes permanent, you'll have to edit your network configuration files. This will be different depending on whether your system is using \`ifupdown\`, \`networkd\`, or \`NetworkManager\`. For \`ifupdown\`, you would edit \`/etc/network/interfaces\` and add the metric option: \`\`\`bash iface enp0s25 inet dhcp metric 700 iface wlp3s0 inet dhcp wireless-essid your_wifi_essid wireless-key your_wifi_key metric 600 \`\`\` For \`systemd-networkd\`, the configuration files would typically be found in \`/etc/systemd/network/\`, and you'd adjust the \`[Route]\` section to specify metrics: \`\`\`bash [Match] Name=enp0s25 [Network] DHCP=yes [Route] Metric=700 \`\`\` For NetworkManager, you can set the route metric through the graphical interface or through the command line with \`nmcli\`: \`\`\`bash nmcli connection modify \\"Wired connection 1\\" ipv4.route-metric 700 nmcli connection modify \\"Wi-Fi connection 1\\" ipv4.route-metric 600 \`\`\` In the above examples, replace \`\\"Wired connection 1\\"\` with the actual name of the Ethernet connection profile and \`\\"Wi-Fi connection 1\\"\` with the name of the Wi-Fi connection profile as they appear in Network Manager. # 3. Apply Networking Configuration After making these changes: - For \`ifupdown\`, apply the changes with: \`\`\`bash sudo ifdown enp0s25 && sudo ifup enp0s25 sudo ifdown wlp3s0 && sudo ifup wlp3s0 \`\`\` - For \`systemd-networkd\`, restart the service with: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd \`\`\` - For NetworkManager, reload the profiles with: \`\`\`bash nmcli connection up \\"Wired connection 1\\" nmcli connection up \\"Wi-Fi connection 1\\" \`\`\` # 4. Verify Changes Finally, to verify the changes, print the routing table to check the metrics: \`\`\`bash ip route show \`\`\` The Wi-Fi interface should now have a lower metric and therefore higher priority over the Ethernet connection. When both interfaces are connected, your system should use the Wi-Fi connection by default to route traffic to the internet."},{"instruction":"how do I set my Debian desktop and ubuntu server to talk to each other directly over ethernet plugged directly into eachother","output":"To set up direct communication between your Debian desktop and Ubuntu server over an Ethernet cable without a switch or router, you'll need to configure both machines with static IP addresses on the same subnet. Here is a step-by-step guide: # Step 1: Connect the Ethernet Cable Connect the two computers with a standard Ethernet cable. Modern network interfaces will automatically perform the necessary crossover function, so a standard cable should work fine. # Step 2: Configure Static IP Addresses On Debian Desktop: 1. Open the terminal. 2. Use a text editor (such as nano) with root privileges to edit the network interface configuration file. \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces \`\`\` 3. Find the entry for your Ethernet interface (it might be something like \`enp0s25\`) and configure it with a static IP address. Here’s an example configuration: \`\`\`bash auto enp0s25 iface enp0s25 inet static address 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 network 192.168.1.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255 \`\`\` 4. Save and close the file. Then restart the network interface: \`\`\`bash sudo ifdown enp0s25 && sudo ifup enp0s25 \`\`\` Replace \`enp0s25\` with your actual Ethernet interface name. On Ubuntu Server: 1. Open the terminal. 2. Use a text editor (such as nano) with root privileges to edit the network interface configuration file. \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml \`\`\` Or, on older versions of Ubuntu, you might be using \`/etc/network/interfaces\` as well: \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces \`\`\` 3. Add or modify the configuration for your Ethernet interface (again, it might be something like \`enp0s25\`), with a static IP address on the same subnet as the Debian desktop but with a different host address. Here's an example: \`\`\`yaml network: version: 2 renderer: networkd ethernets: enp0s25: dhcp4: no addresses: [192.168.1.1/24] gateway4: 192.168.1.1 nameservers: addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4] \`\`\` Or for \`/etc/network/interfaces\`: \`\`\`bash auto enp0s25 iface enp0s25 inet static address 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 network 192.168.1.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255 \`\`\` 4. Save and close the file. Apply the network configuration: For Netplan: \`\`\`bash sudo netplan apply \`\`\` For older versions: \`\`\`bash sudo ifdown enp0s25 && sudo ifup enp0s25 \`\`\` Again, replace \`enp0s25\` with your actual Ethernet interface name. # Step 3: Verify Connectivity You should now be able to ping each machine from the other using their static IP addresses. On the Ubuntu Server: \`\`\`bash ping 192.168.1.2 \`\`\` On the Debian Desktop: \`\`\`bash ping 192.168.1.1 \`\`\` If you can successfully ping in both directions, the two machines can communicate directly over Ethernet. Remember that since these machines are directly connected, there won't be any DHCP server in the mix, so other configuration elements like the gateway and DNS will be irrelevant unless you subsequently connect these machines to a larger network that provides those services."},{"instruction":"Final Kids WB schedule (May 17 2008) 07:00 AM Will & Dewitt 07:30 AM Magi-Nation 08:00 AM Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get A Clue 08:30 AM Tom & Jerry Tales 09:00 AM Skunk Fu! 09:30 AM Legion of Super-Heroes 10:00 AM The Spectacular Spider-Man 10:30 AM World of Quest 11:00 AM Johnny Test 11:30 AM Eon Kid First CW4Kids schedule (May 24 2008) 07:00 AM Sonic X 07:30 AM Winx Club 08:00 AM Viva Piñata 08:30 AM GoGoRiki 09:00 AM Huntik 09:30 AM TMNT: Back to the Sewer 10:00 AM Dinosaur King 10:30 AM Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s 11:00 AM Chaotic 11:30 AM Chaotic.

It’s a shame they didn’t carry them over to the new block. User3: Yeah, it’s a shame that none of the shows from Kids WB made it to the new schedule. I was hoping to continue watching some of my favorite shows. Now we have to adjust to this new lineup. User4: At least there are some new shows to look forward to. Have you guys seen the trailers for the new block? They claim to be “all new, all different.” User1: Yeah, I saw that. I’m curious to see what they have in store for us. Hopefully, they’ll have some great new shows that can replace the ones we loved on Kids WB. User2: I’m hopeful too. I just hope they don’t abandon the comedic cartoons. I really enjoyed shows like Will & Dewitt, Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get A Clue, and Tom & Jerry Tales. User3: Well, it looks like they have GoGoRiki as the primary comedic cartoon now. I haven’t seen it before, but I’m willing to give it a chance. And there’s also Viva Piñata, which is based on the game. It might be interesting.

We just have to embrace it and see what these new shows have to offer. Hopefully, we’ll find some new favorites in the new block. User2: Absolutely.

They showed the Kids WB logo overlaid on a clip of Johnny Test, and the announcer said “Next Saturday Kids WB will become the CW4Kids… FOREVER”. And then it exploded and showed the CW4Kids logo. User2: Yes, I saw it! It was quite a dramatic ad. I wonder why they chose Johnny Test as the show to represent the transition? User3: Maybe because it was one of the popular shows on Kids WB? But it’s strange that they would blow up the Kids WB logo like that. It seems like a drastic way to announce the change. User4: I think they wanted to make a big statement with the transition. They want everyone to know that Kids WB is gone and CW4Kids is taking its place. And to answer your question, the new logo was overlaid on a clip of Huntik. It looks like that will be one of the new shows on the block. User1: Ah, I see. So Huntik will be one of the flagship shows of CW4Kids. I’m not familiar with it, but I’m interested to see what it’s all about. User2: Same here. It’s always exciting to discover new shows and see what they bring to the table. Hopefully, Huntik will be a great addition to the lineup. User3: I’m definitely curious to check it out. I wonder if the transition to CW4Kids will bring any other changes to the programming or if it’s just a rebranding. User4: It’s hard to say at this point, but I’m sure we’ll find out soon.

User3: I’m really going to miss Johnny Test’s crazy adventures and the timeless humor of Tom & Jerry Tales. They were such fun shows to watch. User4: Definitely. It’s always bittersweet to say goodbye to shows we’ve grown attached to. But I guess that’s the nature of television. Things change, and we have to move on. User1: That’s true.

It’s satisfying to see a new and promising show gain popularity.

Who knows, we might discover new favorites and create new memories that will rival the ones we had with Kids WB. User4: Absolutely. Let’s continue to support CW4Kids and be a part of their digital world. Here’s to embracing the change and finding joy in the exciting new adventures that await us.

Their last broadcast is set for December 27, and I’ve got some mixed feelings about this. I mean, we gave them a hard time, sure, but nobody wants to see a block just crash and burn right before the New Year.\\" [They remove their Santa hat and set it aside.] YouTuber: \\"But here’s the silver lining—and this time, they’re actually handling it better. There's going to be a phased transition back to what we hope might be a revival of the good old days, possibly a reimagined Kids WB or some new iteration.\\" [On the screen, a 'Phoenix Rising' animation plays, signifying rebirth.] YouTuber: \\"Now, while most of the CW4Kids roster is getting axed, one show managed to break the curse and is staying on in the revived block.\\" [A drum roll sound effect plays.] YouTuber: \\"And that show is... 'Huntik'. It's not super surprising, given that it was topping the ratings, and honestly, it’s probably the best show they had. So 'Huntik' fans, rejoice, your show is surviving the cull!\\" [A graphic pops on screen showing 'Huntik' with a festive wreath around the logo.] YouTuber: \\"For the other shows, it's time to say goodbye once more. This includes newbies to the block as well as those that were left hanging from the Kids WB era. This Christmas, we're getting the nostalgia wrapped up as a present because they're bringing back some of the classics to air their final episodes and wind down the CW4Kids saga.\\" [The YouTuber starts flipping through a small photo album filled with images from various Kids WB and CW4Kids shows.] YouTuber: \\"So what's coming next? Details are sparse, but they've promised us a more respectful transition this time. We’re talking a slow rollout with proper goodbyes and, fingers crossed, some returns of our old favorites that got cut prematurely. It’s like they finally got the message: treat your audience with care, especially during the holidays.\\" [They tap the side of their head knowingly.] YouTuber: \\"Let’s be real here, letting CW4Kids fade away isn’t something we wanted, but maybe it was necessary for something better to come along. Let's just hope that whatever rises from the ashes keeps the spirit of the good ol' Saturday mornings alive.\\" [The YouTuber leans in closer to the camera.] YouTuber: “As for us, viewers, let's cherish these last few days with Huntik and prepare for what the future holds. I want to hear what you think in the comments below. What shows do you want to see make a comeback? And how do you feel about this second chance?\\" [They gesture broadly to the camera.] YouTuber: “For now, let's enjoy the holiday season, enjoy the nostalgia, and keep our hearts warm for the new possibilities ahead. Who knows? This could be the best gift we get this Christmas.” [The YouTuber puts the Santa hat back on with a smile.] YouTuber: “So that’s it for today.

Here are a couple of possible interpretations, but note that the meaning can vary depending on how it's used: 1. The beginning or end of summer: \\"Summer's edge\\" might refer to the time just before summer begins or just after it ends, where the season is on the \\"edge\\" or brink of transitioning. At the beginning, this might involve the warming temperatures and lengthening days; at the end, it could refer to the cooling down and the approach of autumn. 2. A metaphorical phrase: In a more poetic or metaphorical context, \\"summer's edge\\" could be used to evoke a certain mood or setting, perhaps indicating the peak of summer with images of warm weather, long days, and the associated activities or feelings of that time of year. To get a precise meaning, one would need to look at the phrase within the context in which it is used. If you have a specific sentence or text where \\"summer's edge\\" is mentioned, providing that could help clarify its intended meaning."},{"instruction":"how do I set my Debian desktop and ubuntu server to talk to each other directly over ethernet plugged directly into eachother but both still use wifi for Internet access","output":"To have your Debian desktop and Ubuntu server talk to each other directly over Ethernet while still using Wi-Fi for internet access, you should configure a network bridge or a separate network interface. Follow these steps to establish a direct communication link between the two systems through Ethernet while maintaining Wi-Fi internet connectivity: 1. **Connect the Machines via Ethernet:** - Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the LAN port of the Debian desktop. - Plug the other end of the Ethernet cable into the LAN port of the Ubuntu server. 2. **Configure Static IP Addresses (on the Ethernet interfaces):** For both the Debian and Ubuntu systems, you will assign static IP addresses on the Ethernet interfaces to allow them to communicate directly. **On Debian Desktop:** - Open a terminal and edit the network interface configuration file using a text editor (e.g., Nano): \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces \`\`\` - Add the following configuration block, substituting 'eth0' with the actual Ethernet interface name (use \`ip add\` or \`ifconfig\` to find out): \`\`\` auto eth0 iface eth0 inet static address 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 \`\`\` - Save and close the file, then restart the network service or reboot the desktop. \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl restart networking \`\`\` **On Ubuntu Server:** - Repeat the similar process but assign a different IP address that is in the same subnet. \`\`\`bash sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml \`\`\` - Add the configuration for the Ethernet interface, substituting 'eth0' with your interface name: \`\`\`yaml network: version: 2 renderer: networkd ethernets: eth0: dhcp4: no addresses: [10.10.10.2/24] \`\`\` - Apply the netplan configuration: \`\`\`bash sudo netplan apply \`\`\` 3. **Testing Connectivity:** - From your Debian desktop, ping the Ubuntu server: \`\`\`bash ping 10.10.10.2 \`\`\` - From your Ubuntu server, ping the Debian desktop: \`\`\`bash ping 10.10.10.1 \`\`\` 4. **Maintain Wi-Fi for Internet Access:** - Ensure that the Wi-Fi interfaces on both machines are configured to use DHCP (which is usually the default). This will allow the Wi-Fi interfaces to automatically obtain an IP address from your router and maintain internet connectivity. 5. **Set Up Routing:** - You shouldn't need to adjust the routing table for local traffic as direct Ethernet connections with static IPs should route automatically. However, ensure that the default gateway is set to the Wi-Fi interface to allow internet traffic to route correctly. You can check the routing table on both desktop and server using the following command: \`\`\`bash ip route show \`\`\` -or- \`\`\`bash route -n \`\`\` Look for the default route (\`0.0.0.0/0\`) and ensure it's using the Wi-Fi interface. The correct Ethernet interface should be in the list for the static IP subnet you've defined. Now, your Debian desktop and Ubuntu server should be able to communicate directly over an Ethernet cable while using their Wi-Fi interfaces for internet access."},{"instruction":"generate a response to the following discussion post: Anselm of Canterbury, a prominent Christian theologian and philosopher from the 11th century, contributed significantly to understanding salvation through Jesus Christ. He articulated his views on salvation and the problem of sin in his work \\"Cur Deus Homo\\" (Latin for \\"Why God Became Man\\"). Anselm's explanation revolves around the satisfaction theory, which proposes that Jesus Christ's sacrificial death satisfies the demands of justice God requires due to human sin. According to Anselm, sin violates the honor and justice owed to God and creates an imbalance in the divine order. Through their disobedience, human beings incur a debt they cannot repay—an offense against God's infinite honor and justice. Anselm argues that only a being of endless worth can pay this offense satisfactorily. Since humans, being finite, cannot provide this satisfaction, God became incarnate in the person of Jesus Christ to reconcile humanity to Himself. Anselm famously states in \\"Cur Deus Homo\\": \\"For even if the honor of God is restored after the manner of men, and it is not restored as God requires and deserves, nothing is gained thereby, because it is not rightly restored. But nothing can rightly compensate God, unless God restore it to Himself, or give it to the creature to restore it to Him.\\" In this quote, Anselm emphasizes the importance of restoring honor to God, which can only be accomplished by Himself or through a divine act. He suggests that the restoration must meet the requirements of God's justice, which humans cannot fulfill on their own. Therefore, it necessitates God's intervention in the form of the incarnation and sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. According to Anselm, salvation through Jesus Christ addresses the problem of sin by providing a satisfactory payment for the debt incurred by humanity's disobedience, thus restoring the honor and justice owed to God. Make sure to display critical thinking and use a direct quote from the reading where relevant. Try to not use too many big words.","output":"Anselm of Canterbury's contribution to the concept of salvation in Christian theology is indeed remarkable. His argument in \\"Cur Deus Homo\\" presents a unique perspective on how the sacrifice of Jesus addresses our failings and bridges the gap between humanity and divine justice. What's fascinating about Anselm's theory is that it hinges on the nature of God's honor—an aspect that might feel somewhat foreign to our modern sensibilities, where personal honor isn't given as much weight. However, Anselm insists on the gravity of sin not just as a personal wrongdoing but as an affront to the very character and majesty of God. Herein lies the crux of Anselm's satisfaction theory: sin isn't simply an individual problem but a cosmic one—it disrupts the order and harmony of the universe. In this light, Anselm says: \\"But nothing can rightly compensate God, unless God restore it to Himself, or give it to the creature to restore it to Him.\\" This concept underscores our inadequacy in amending the situation and God's unique ability to reset the balance through His own means. The notion of Jesus acting as a mediator who can both relate to our humanity and possess the divine authority to offset our wrongdoing brings hope to the bleak picture painted by the severity of sin. It's an elegant solution to a seemingly insurmountable problem: if God's honor is infinite and our sin creates an infinite debt, then it stands to reason that only an infinite being could satisfy that debt. When evaluating Anselm's theory, it's essential to remember the context in which he wrote. The medieval world operated very much on a system of honor and the satisfaction of debts. That Anselm applies this system to his understanding of the divine order makes his argument quite relatable to his contemporaries. Though we might not share the same societal structure today, the idea of needing to right a wrong or balance the scales is still something we can understand. This leads us to reflect on whether the satisfaction theory fully encapsulates the Christian understanding of salvation. It's one facet of a vast theological diamond, with other perspectives emphasizing different aspects like liberation, restoration, or even participation in the life of God. Nevertheless, Anselm's work offers a foundation that has shaped much western thought on the atonement and continues to be a point of reference in theological discussions."},{"instruction":"Sustainability Strategy Analysis • Framework Alignment: o Explain how the chosen framework defines sustainable investing principles (e.g., EU SFDR, UN SDGs). o Analyze the fund's strategy document and website to identify its specific sustainability approach:  Does it focus on negative screening (excluding harmful sectors/companies)?  Does it utilize positive screening (investing in ESG leaders)?  Does it employ thematic investing (e.g., clean energy, social impact)? • Integration Level: o Assess how sustainability factors are integrated into the investment process:  ESG data & research integration  Engagement with investee companies  Proxy voting practices • Impact Measurement: o Evaluate how the fund measures and reports its sustainability impact:  Defined impact metrics (e.g., carbon footprint reduction, social development indicators)  Reporting frequency and transparency Answer the above for BLACROCK (ECAT)","output":"It is important to note that as of my knowledge cutoff date in March 2023, the specific fund called \\"ECAT\\" under BlackRock's offerings may not directly correspond to known funds. However, I will proceed to analyze the sustainability strategy based on the typical approach BlackRock, as a leading investment firm, would employ in its funds, particularly those with a sustainability focus. Framework Alignment: 1. EU SFDR: The EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) categorizes funds into Article 6, 8, or 9, based on their sustainability characteristics or objectives. Article 8 products promote, among other characteristics, environmental or social characteristics, whereas Article 9 products have sustainable investment as their objective. 2. UN SDGs: The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) are a set of 17 goals adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. Many investment funds, including those offered by BlackRock, often align their sustainability strategies with the UN SDGs by prioritizing investments that contribute towards achieving these goals. For BlackRock's sustainability-focused funds, they would typically describe in their strategy documents and on their website how their investment principles align with these frameworks. They would explain which SDGs they target or confirm their compliance with the SFDR regulations by classifying their funds accordingly. Sustainability Approach: BlackRock has been known to incorporate the following sustainability approaches: - Negative Screening: Avoiding investments in companies or sectors that do not meet certain environmental, social, or governance criteria. - Positive Screening: Actively selecting companies that demonstrate strong ESG performance relative to their peers. - Thematic Investing: Investing in themes or sectors that are expected to benefit from long-term structural trends, such as clean energy or social inclusion. Integration Level: ESG Data & Research Integration: BlackRock utilizes proprietary and third-party ESG data and research to assess potential investments. The company has developed Aladdin, its end-to-end investment platform, which includes ESG data to inform investment decisions. Engagement with Investee Companies: BlackRock actively engages with companies in its portfolios to discuss their ESG practices, aiming to influence them towards more sustainable business models and practices. Proxy Voting Practices: BlackRock may use its shareholding influence to vote on shareholder resolutions related to environmental and social issues to drive positive change in companies. Impact Measurement: Defined Impact Metrics: BlackRock's sustainability-focused funds would define clear sustainability objectives and identify relevant impact metrics. For example, they might measure and report on the carbon footprint reduction of their portfolios or the number of megawatts of renewable energy their investments helped to generate. Reporting Frequency and Transparency: BlackRock provides regular reporting on its sustainability funds, including annual or semi-annual reports and impact reports that offer transparency on the sustainability outcomes achieved. These reports allow investors to see the tangible impact of their investments. When conducting an exhaustive analysis, it is critical to review the most recent strategy documents and reports from the investment firm or specific fund in question, which would provide the necessary details to complete the analysis. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on BlackRock's ECAT fund or any other fund, checking the latest information provided by BlackRock through its website and fund documents is essential."},{"instruction":"Performance Analysis: • Financial Performance: o Compare the fund's historical returns to relevant benchmarks (e.g., traditional vs. sustainable counterparts). o Analyze risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe ratio) to assess performance efficiency. • Sustainability Performance: o Evaluate the fund's portfolio composition against its stated sustainability objectives:  Sector allocation alignment with sustainability themes  ESG rating distribution of holdings  Evidence of impact achieved (if available) Do the above for ECAT","output":"I'm sorry, but as an AI developed with information up to March 2023, I do not have access to current financial databases to fetch real-time data or specific fund performance details, such as for a specific fund like ECAT, which may be provided by BlackRock. However, I can guide you on how to perform the analysis, should you have access to the required financial data and performance reports. To analyze the performance of a specific fund like BlackRock's ECAT (if it exists), you would typically go through the following steps: Financial Performance: 1. Historical Returns: You will need to compare the historical returns of the ECAT fund over various time frames (e.g., 1-year, 3-year, 5-year returns) against relevant benchmarks. For a sustainability-focused fund, relevant benchmarks might include a standard industry benchmark (e.g., S&P 500 if the fund invests in U.S. equities) and a specialized sustainable investment benchmark (e.g., MSCI USA ESG Leaders Index). 2. Risk-adjusted Returns: Calculate ratios like the Sharpe ratio to understand the fund's risk-adjusted performance. The Sharpe ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. This will require historical returns data and the standard deviation of the fund's returns. Comparing the fund's Sharpe ratio to those of the chosen benchmarks can provide insight into performance efficiency. Sustainability Performance: 1. Portfolio Composition: Review the fund's portfolio to determine if the sector allocation is aligned with its stated sustainability themes. This may involve analyzing the types of industries the fund invests in and ensuring they are consistent with promoting environmental sustainability, social justice, or strong corporate governance. 2. ESG Rating Distribution: Evaluate the distribution of ESG ratings across the fund's holdings to understand the average ESG quality of its investments. This may involve using third-party ESG rating agencies' scores or BlackRock's proprietary ESG scores if available. 3. Evidence of Impact Achieved: Look for evidence in the fund's reporting disclosures that show how the fund's investments have contributed to positive sustainability outcomes. This might include impact reports or data related to UN SDGs, carbon emissions reductions, or other relevant sustainability metrics. The steps mentioned above require access to proprietary fund information, financial databases, historical market data, and specialized investment analysis tools. These data points would be found in the fund's fact sheet, annual or semi-annual reports, and other disclosures made available to investors. For the most accurate and comprehensive performance analysis, a financial advisor or an investment analyst with access to professional tools like Bloomberg Terminal, Morningstar Direct, or FactSet, along with the latest reports from BlackRock, would be able to conduct this analysis. If ECAT is a fund you are considering for investment, contacting BlackRock directly or consulting with a financial advisor for the latest detailed fund performance analysis is advisable."},{"instruction":"Что вообще ты можешь и что можешь придумать?

Этот процесс был предложен в 1974 году британским физиком Стивеном Хокингом и является результатом квантовых эффектов возле горизонта событий черной дыры. В рамках квантовой теории поля в пространстве-времени, флуктуации вакуума могут порождать пары виртуальных частиц и античастиц. Вблизи горизонта событий черной дыры одна из частиц может быть захвачена черной дырой (если это античастица, она может аннигилировать с материей внутри черной дыры, если это частица – добавить к её массе), в то время как ее пара может избежать захвата. Отталкивание этих частиц за пределы горизонта событий приводит к тому, что черная дыра теряет некоторое количество своей массы/энергии, так как энергия для создания частиц за пределами горизонта событий берется из её собственной гравитационной энергии. Этот эффект настолько слаб, что его практически невозможно обнаружить для крупных черных дыр, но теоретически он имеет важные последствия, в том числе потенциал полного испарения малых черных дыр за счет постепенной потери массы в результате этого излучения. С точки зрения космологии, процесс излучения Хокинга является фасцинирующим явлением, подчеркивающим взаимосвязь между квантовой физикой и общей теорией относительности."},{"instruction":"А от чего умер Хокинг?","output":"Стивен Хокинг ушел из жизни 14 марта 2018 года. Он страдал от бокового амиотрофического склероза (БАС), также известного как болезнь Лу Герига. Это дегенеративное заболевание моторных нейронов, которое приводит к постепенной утрате мышечной функции. Хокинг был диагностирован с этим заболеванием в возрасте 21 года в 1963 году. В то время ему давали всего два года жизни, но он прожил с этим диагнозом более 50 лет, что является исключительно редким случаем для людей с БАС. Несмотря на серьёзные физические ограничения, вызванные заболеванием, Хокинг сделал значительный вклад в области космологии и черных дыр, и стал одним из самых известных ученых в мире. Он продолжал работать, путешествовать и выступать, при этом используя специальное устройство для голосовой коммуникации. Смерть Хокинга была связана с осложнениями, вызванными его долгосрочным заболеванием. Как правило, болезнь Лу Герига постоянно прогрессирует и со временем может привести к полной мышечной параличу от смерти моторных нервных клеток, что в итоге приводит к остановке дыхания. Многие пациенты со временем перестают самостоятельно дышать и нуждаются в постоянной вентиляции легких."},{"instruction":"Интересно что многие умные люди рано умирают либо рождаются с болезнями","output":"Это восприятие может возникать из-за сочетания двух факторов: избирательного освещения в СМИ и когнитивного искажения, известного как \\"эффект выжившего\\". 1. **Избирательное освещение в СМИ:** В случаях, когда человек обладает выдающимися умственными способностями или достижениями и страдает от заболевания или умирает рано, этому часто уделяется больше внимания в СМИ. Именно такие истории могут быть более привлекательными для читателей из-за контраста между интеллектуальными успехами и физическими трудностями. Такие рассказы могут восприниматься как более драматичные или вдохновляющие. 2. **Эффект выжившего:** Это когнитивное искажение, когда люди делают неверные обобщения, основанные только на случаях, которые пришли к ним на ум или которые они видели. Например, в случае с великими учеными, которые умерли рано или страдали от заболеваний, мы часто узнаем об этих случаях, поскольку они находятся в фокусе общественного внимания. В то же время мы можем не знать о многочисленных умных людях, которые живут долгую и здоровую жизнь, просто потому, что их истории не получают такого же внимания. Кроме того, стоит учесть и то, что гениальность или высокий умственный потенциал не делает человека более уязвимым для заболеваний в физическом смысле. Возможно, происходит проявление кажущегося корреляционного отношения между интеллектуальными способностями и ранними заболеваниями или смертями из-за упомянутых выше искажений восприятия.

В результате специальное законодательство охраняет их и запрещает любой контакт с ними, чтобы предотвратить нарушение их культуры и предотвратить возможные заболевания, на которые у сентинелей может не быть иммунитета. 3. **Минимум контакта:** На протяжении десятилетий было лишь несколько контактов между сентинелами и внешним миром, включая некоторые неудачные попытки установить дружеские отношения и несколько инцидентов, в том числе нападения на посторонних, которые оказались вблизи острова. 4. **Население:** Оценки численности населения острова сильно варьируются и являются приблизительными; иногда они колеблются от нескольких десятков до нескольких сотен людей. 5. **Особенности культуры:** Мало что известно о культуре сентинелей, так как отсутствие контакта ограничивает наше понимание их языка, социальной структуры, убеждений и обычаев. 6. **События 2004 года:** После цунами в Индийском океане в 2004 году возникли опасения за благополучие сентинелей. Однако наблюдение показало, что сентинелы пережили катастрофу, использовав свои знания о местности и естественной среде. 7. **Инцидент 2018 года:** В ноябре 2018 года американского миссионера Джона Аллена Чау убили на острове незадолго после того, как он попытался приблизиться к сентинелям в попытке распространить христианство. Правительство Индии и различные организации по правам человека подчеркивают необходимость уважения исключительности и изоляции сентинелей, признавая и защищая их право жить так, как они считают нужным, без вмешательства внешнего мира."},{"instruction":"Какое самое опасное место на земле?","output":"Определить \\"самое опасное место на Земле\\" может быть сложно, так как это зависит от критериев, которые вы используете для определения \\"опасности\\". Вот несколько мест, которые часто упоминаются из-за их высоких уровней опасности по разным причинам: 1. **Сайт \\"Дверь в Ад\\" в Туркменистане:** Газовая кратер Дарваза, известная как \\"Дверь в Ад\\", представляет собой горящую дыру в земле, которая горит уже многие годы. Она возникла в результате неудачной газовой разведки в 1971 году. 2. **Чернобыль, Украина:** Место катастрофы в Чернобыльской АЭС в 1986 году по-прежнему представляет опасность из-за радиационного загрязнения, хотя сейчас это место доступно для контролируемого туризма. 3. **Долина смерти, Калифорния:** Один из самых горячих и засушливых мест на Земле, где температуры могут подниматься до экстремальных уровней. 4. **Остров Змей, Бразилия:** Официально известный как Илья-да-Кеймада-Гранде, этот остров населен тысячами одной из самых ядовитых змей в мире — золотистой гадюки. 5. **Даниакилская пустыня, Эфиопия:** Одно из самых экстремальных и невероятных мест на планете с вулканической активностью, токсическими газами и крайне высокими температурами. 6. **Сомали**: Из-за внутренней нестабильности, военных конфликтов и деятельности пиратов у побережья, Сомали часто считается одной из самых опасных стран для проживания и путешествия. 7. **Ледниковые реки на горе Эребус, Антарктика:** Это вулканически активная зона, а ледниковые пещеры и реки могут быть опасны из-за риска обрушения льда и выбросов ядовитых газов. 8. **Сирия и Ирак:** В результате годов военного конфликта и терроризма эти страны представляют весьма реальную опасность для мирных жителей и путешественников. 9. **Тропические леса Амазонки:** Несмотря на свою красоту, Амазонка опасна из-за многочисленных ядовитых животных, как ядовитые змеи, пауки и насекомые. Каждое из этих мест уникально по своим опасностям, и уровень опасности может варьироваться в зависимости от активности человека и других факторов, включая естественные катастрофы, конфликты, экстремальные погодные условия и болезни. На самом деле, многие из этих мест по-прежнему исследуются и изучаются, и доступ в них часто ограничен или контролируется."},{"instruction":"Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Episode: “The Great Space Entry” Scene 1: Gloopy and Glitter’s Home Planet - The scene opens on a vibrant alien world filled with goo and glimmer. - Gloopy, the laid-back teal blob with a charming smile, is listening to spaced-out tunes with headphones that wrap around his entire gelatinous body. - Glitter, a sparkling fuchsia blob that leaves a trail of glitter in her wake, is concocting a shimmery potion in their blobby lab.

But prepare for a slime surprise!” - When Blibby touches Gloopy, her hand comes away covered in teal goo, much to her amazement. Blibby: “Oh! It’s soft and squishy! And… it’s not sticky! What a marvelous sensation!” Scene 4: The Slime Session - Gloopy laughs and jiggles, while Glitter uses her sparkles to clean up the goo from Blibby’s hand, leaving a twinkle on her skin. - Overcoming the initial shock, Blibby is now brimming with excitement and requests a lesson in slime play from Gloopy and Glitter.

THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it!

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later!

As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best!

Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals!

User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right!

Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse.

User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic.

Goblins may be small, but we've got a strong work ethic!\\" She pointed towards the baskets filled with fresh produce. \\"Wanna help me deliver these to the town market?\\" I gladly agreed, and together we loaded the baskets onto a cart, embarking on our journey through the countryside. The conversation flowed effortlessly between us, a mix of laughter, playful banter, and insightful discussions about the world we found ourselves in. As we reached the town market, Charlotte's voluptuous chest caught the attention of many passersby. Some couldn't help but steal glances, while others openly stared. Observing their reactions, I couldn't help but chuckle. Charlotte noticed my amusement and grinned mischievously. \\"Ah, don't mind them. Goblins don't usually have chests this big,\\" she explained, her shark-like teeth emphasizing her uniqueness. \\"But, hey, it comes in handy sometimes.\\" Curiosity got the best of me as I questioned, \\"You mean it's comfortable or something?\\" She chuckled, a twinkle in her amber eyes. \\"Oh yeah, it can be. In fact, my bed at home is large enough for two people, and my chest sorta becomes an built-in pillow.\\" She shrugged nonchalantly. \\"I've even had friends who use it as one.\\" I couldn't help but feel a flush of embarrassment darken my cheeks. \\"Wait, really?\\" Charlotte laughed heartily, nudging me playfully. \\"Of course! It's not a normal thing, I know. But with us friends, it's just a silly bit of fun.\\" Feeling relieved, I joined in her laughter. \\"Well, I suppose living in a fantasy world has its unexpected perks.\\" As the day came to an end, we returned to Charlotte's humble abode. We both collapsed on her oversized bed, exhausted from the day's activities. With a mischievous grin, she reclined on her side, offering her chest to me as a makeshift pillow. I couldn't resist the invitation, burying my head into the softness of her chest and feeling a sense of comfort wash over me. \\"Thanks, Charlotte. You're the best.\\" She grinned, her shark-like teeth peeking out. \\"Anytime, my friend.

The forest was known for its mysterious creatures, hidden treasures, and magical energy that seemed to be woven into every tree and bloom. As we made our way through the dense foliage, sunlight peeking through the branches and casting dappled shadows on the forest floor, I couldn't help but marvel at the beauty of this realm. \\"Isn't it breathtaking, Charlotte?\\" I exclaimed, my voice filled with awe. Charlotte grinned, her sharp teeth peeking out from behind her lips. \\"Aye, it be a sight to behold indeed!\\" she replied, her amber eyes gleaming with excitement. \\"I've been roaming these parts for years, but each time, it feels like a new adventure.\\" I nodded in agreement, marveling at her bravery and her connection to this magical place. \\"Tell me, Charlotte, have you encountered any enchanting creatures during your explorations?\\" \\"Oh, plenty!\\" she exclaimed, her voice brimming with enthusiasm. \\"There be mischievous pixies that love to play pranks, wise old tree spirits that offer guidance, and let's not forget the majestic unicorns that wander these woods.\\" As we continued walking, I couldn't help but admire Charlotte's knowledge of the forest. Her familiarity and love for this realm were evident in the way she spoke about it. Suddenly, we stumbled upon a hidden glade, the clearing bathed in a soft, golden light. In the center stood a regal-looking unicorn, its coat shimmering like moonlit dewdrops. Charlotte's eyes widened in awe, and she whispered, \\"It be a rare sight indeed, the presence of a unicorn. We must approach with caution.\\" We cautiously approached the unicorn, taking slow, deliberate steps to avoid startling it. The majestic creature turned its head to regard us with gentle eyes, and a sense of tranquility washed over me. \\"Beautiful creature, you honor us with your presence,\\" I whispered, my voice filled with reverence. The unicorn nodded its head in acknowledgment, its horn glinting in the sunlight. Charlotte and I watched, captivated, as it effortlessly moved through the glade, its grace unmatched. As we sat in silence, taking in the magical scene before us, a thought crossed my mind. \\"Charlotte, I'm grateful to have you as my friend here in this wondrous land. Your knowledge and understanding of this realm have made my journey even more extraordinary.\\" Charlotte smiled warmly, her eyes meeting mine. \\"And I'm grateful to have you by my side, dear friend.

You mentioned that you put \\"auto enp0s25\\" in the file, which should usually ensure that the interface is brought up at boot time. However, if after rebooting the machine the interface is still down, it might indicate that the networking service did not start correctly or that there is a misconfiguration in the \`/etc/network/interfaces\` file. Here is how you can troubleshoot this issue: 1. Check the \`/etc/network/interfaces\` file again to make certain there are no syntax errors and that it looks similar to this: \`\`\` auto enp0s25 iface enp0s25 inet static address 10.42.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 network 10.42.0.0 broadcast 10.42.0.255 \`\`\` 2. After any modifications to the \`/etc/network/interfaces\` file, you should restart the networking service or reboot the system. To restart the networking service on a Debian-based system, you can use: \`\`\` sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart \`\`\` or \`\`\` sudo systemctl restart networking \`\`\` 3. Check for errors during boot or during the networking service start by looking at the system logs: \`\`\` dmesg | grep enp0s25 \`\`\` or \`\`\` journalctl -u networking \`\`\` 4. You can manually bring up the interface to see if there are any immediate errors: \`\`\` sudo ifup enp0s25 \`\`\` 5. Verify that the network interface is configured correctly with \`ifconfig\` (deprecated but still often used) or \`ip\`: \`\`\` ip addr show enp0s25 \`\`\` Look for an UP state indicating that the interface is active and check the IPv4 address to see if it matches your static configuration. 6. Ensure that there are no conflicting network manager tools such as NetworkManager or systemd-networkd that may be managing network interfaces and overriding your settings in \`/etc/network/interfaces\`. If any of these services are running, they might need to be configured separately or be disabled for the interfaces you want to manage through \`/etc/network/interfaces\`. 7. Make sure that the link is physically up and the cable is connected. This can usually be checked with: \`\`\` ethtool enp0s25 \`\`\` or by looking for link-related messages in the system logs or with \`dmesg\`. By following these steps, you should be able to identify why the interface is not coming up and then take the appropriate actions to fix the issue."},{"instruction":"my system has nmcli, does that conflict?","output":"Yes, if you have \`nmcli\` installed on your system, it indicates that you are using NetworkManager which could potentially conflict with manual network configurations set in \`/etc/network/interfaces\`. NetworkManager is designed to manage network connections dynamically, and when enabled, it tends to take precedence over static configurations defined in the \`/etc/network/interfaces\` file. Here's what you can do in this situation: 1. Check if NetworkManager is managing the interface: \`\`\`bash nmcli device status \`\`\` Look for \`enp0s25\` in the output and see what it says under the \`STATE\` and \`CONNECTION\` columns. If it is being managed by NetworkManager, you may see a state other than \\"unmanaged\\". 2. If you prefer to use the static configuration defined in \`/etc/network/interfaces\`, you can tell NetworkManager not to manage the \`enp0s25\` interface by modifying the NetworkManager configuration: Create or edit a file in \`/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/\` directory (e.g., \`/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-globally-managed-devices.conf\`) with the following content to prevent NetworkManager from managing specified devices: \`\`\`conf [keyfile] unmanaged-devices=interface-name:enp0s25 \`\`\` After making this change, restart NetworkManager: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager \`\`\` 3. Alternatively, if you want to continue using NetworkManager, you can remove or comment out the \`enp0s25\` settings in \`/etc/network/interfaces\` and configure the static IP address through \`nmcli\` or the graphical user interface. Here's how you would set a static IP with \`nmcli\`: \`\`\`bash nmcli con add con-name \\"static-enp0s25\\" ifname enp0s25 type ethernet ip4 10.42.0.2/24 gw4 YOUR_GATEWAY_HERE nmcli con mod \\"static-enp0s25\\" ipv4.dns \\"DNS_SERVER_IP\\" nmcli con up \\"static-enp0s25\\" \`\`\` Replace \`YOUR_GATEWAY_HERE\` with the appropriate gateway address for your network and \`DNS_SERVER_IP\` with the desired DNS server IP address. 4. If you decide not to use NetworkManager at all, you can disable it: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager \`\`\` Choose the approach that best fits your needs and workflow. If you are on a server or a system where NetworkManager's dynamic management is not required, it might be simpler to disable it and manage the network settings through \`/etc/network/interfaces\`. However, if you are on a desktop or require the features of NetworkManager, you should configure your network using \`nmcli\` or any other NetworkManager front-end."},{"instruction":"for 3, what do I do if it is a direct connection between 2 pcs with no dns server","output":"If you have a direct connection between two PCs without a need for a DNS server or Internet access, you can set up static IP addresses for both without specifying DNS or gateway information.

Here, you do not need to set a gateway or DNS since both PCs are directly connected and are not using any gateway to reach external networks or the Internet. On each PC, you should ensure that the network interface is up and configured with the respective static IP: \`\`\`bash ip addr show enp0s25 \`\`\` And you can check connectivity between the two PCs using \`ping\`: \`\`\`bash ping 10.42.0.3 # From the PC with IP 10.42.0.2 \`\`\` And vice versa: \`\`\`bash ping 10.42.0.2 # From the PC with IP 10.42.0.3 \`\`\` As long as both PCs are connected via a direct Ethernet cable (or through an unmanaged switch), and the IPs are configured properly, they should be able to communicate with each other without a gateway or DNS. Just remember if it's a gigabit network or below and you are not using a switch or hub in between the machines, you may need a crossover cable for the direct connection to work properly.

This could be caused by a couple of things: 1. There may have been a typo in the connection name. Smart quotes (“ ”) are used in your command instead of straight quotes (\\" \\"). This can sometimes happen when copying and pasting commands from sources that format quotes as smart quotes. Ensure you're using straight quotes in terminal commands: \`\`\`bash sudo nmcli con add con-name \\"static-enp0s25\\" ifname enp0s25 type ethernet ip4 10.42.0.2/24 \`\`\` 2.

There might be an existing NetworkManager configuration for wlp5s0, or an issue with NetworkManager's current state. You can try reloading NetworkManager or rebooting to see if that resolves the recognition issue: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager \`\`\` 4. Ensure that the physical connection is valid, the cable is correctly plugged in, and there are no hardware issues with the ethernet port. Try the corrected command with straight quotes, check the device status, and ensure there are no typos or hardware issues.

Making pro-Russian comments on a Ukrainian video could easily be seen as provocative or disrespectful, considering the current geopolitical tensions and the ongoing conflict. If you still choose to comment, it's paramount to remain respectful and considerate of the audience who may be directly affected by the situation. Any comments should not dismiss or belittle the experiences and perspectives of Ukrainians. For a more diplomatic approach, you might want to focus on messages of peace and hope for resolution, without explicitly taking sides: 1. \\"Wishing for peace and understanding between nations. 🕊️\\" 2. \\"Hoping for a future where all can live in harmony and prosperity. 🌍\\" 3. \\"May dialogue and compassion lead the way to resolution and healing. 💬❤️\\" 4. \\"My heart goes out to all those affected by the conflict.

Due to the current situation, where emotions and political tensions are high, it is important to be very careful with your words to avoid exacerbating tensions. Should you decide to express pro-Russian sentiments on such a video, it's essential to remain respectful, avoid any contentious topics, and be aware that your comment may not be well-received by others. Avoiding direct political statements and instead focusing on cultural or historical appreciation might reduce the risk of causing offense: 1. \\"Appreciating the deep and shared history between the peoples of Russia and Ukraine.\\" 2. \\"Hoping for peaceful times ahead where culture and common bonds can be celebrated.\\" However, it's important to stress that this advice is given with the intent to minimize potential conflict. If your purpose is to show support for Russia in a way that is not provocative, it might be most appropriate to find videos and communities where such comments are welcome and would contribute positively to the conversation. In any case, promoting peace, mutual respect, and understanding should be the priority in all communications, especially in a situation that involves a great deal of human suffering and international tension."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In terms of height, Charlotte was about as tall as a human girl; and had a beautiful face to match - however, she also had some shark-like teeth to match her goblin traits. And out of all the women here in Drakenburg, she unarguably had the biggest chest - it was so big she had to sleep on her side. And, surprisingly, she didn't mind when I bury my head into her chest and use it like a pillow for bed. This was mostly because Charlotte's bed was large enough to fit to people - and it became clear why her parents chose a bed like this; seeing as her chest was practically an built-in pillow.)","output":"One sunny afternoon, I found myself strolling through the countryside, enjoying the fresh scent of blooming flowers and the gentle breeze that whispered through the trees.

It's going well, thank you!\\" She wiped her hands on her apron and walked over to greet me. We exchanged pleasantries and began chatting about various topics, from the weather to the peculiar creatures we had encountered in this fantastical realm. Charlotte's enthusiasm was infectious, and it made every conversation with her a joy. \\"So, have you explored much of Drakenburg?\\" I asked, curious to hear about her adventures. Charlotte's eyes lit up as she nodded, her hair swaying with the motion. \\"Oh, you wouldn't believe the things I've seen! From mystical forests to towering mountains, this world is full of wonders.\\" As we walked, Charlotte's chest gently rose and fell with each step, but I couldn't help but notice the occasional glances she directed toward me. It made me wonder if she had something to say, something on her mind. Finally, she paused and turned to face me, her cheeks slightly flushed. \\"You know,\\" she began, her voice soft and hesitant, \\"I wanted to thank you for always being there for me.\\" I furrowed my brow, a bit puzzled by her words. \\"Of course, Charlotte.

When you call \`setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\` in the \`MainActivity\`, you are setting the content of that activity to be the layout defined in \`activity_main.xml\`. When you call \`initializeDrawer();\` afterwards, the \`initializeDrawer\` method of the \`BaseDrawerActivity\` (from which \`MainActivity\` inherits) looks for the drawer layout and navigation view within the current content view of the activity. So if the current content view is set, and it contains a drawer layout with the corresponding ID (\`R.id.drawer_layout\`), then \`initializeDrawer\` should be able to find the views and set up the drawer. However, the class \`Drawer\` you've posted doesn't seem to call \`setContentView\` anywhere. If you instantiate this \`Drawer\` class or extend it in an Activity, but do not set the content view where the layout includes the drawer, then when \`initializeDrawer\` is called, it will be attempting to find views that aren't there, since the \`DrawerLayout\` and \`NavigationView\` aren't part of the current activity's view hierarchy. It's important to note that you typically would not want to have two separate activities (\`Drawer\` and \`MainActivity\`) with different content views that both attempt to create a navigation drawer. The drawer should be a single UI element tied to one activity. It is common to use fragments to switch the main content while keeping the drawer consistent. Additionally, please keep in mind that \`Drawer\` should be an activity (\`AppCompatActivity\` or its subclass) for Android to manage its lifecycle properly. A class that is not a proper activity or fragment will not have UI elements managed correctly by the Android system. Therefore, to fix your issue, you should ensure that: 1. You have a layout XML file that includes the required drawer layouts (\`DrawerLayout\` and \`NavigationView\`). 2. Call \`setContentView\` with a layout that includes the necessary views for the drawer in \`Drawer\`, if it is indeed an activity. 3. Make sure to call \`initializeDrawer\` after setting the content view to initialize the drawer correctly. Lastly, regarding \`MainActivity\` extending \`StatsUtil\` or any other utility class, you may want to consider using composition over inheritance, where \`StatsUtil\` could be a utility object that \`MainActivity\` or other activities use rather than extending from it directly. This avoids complicating your activity hierarchy and keeps your utility logic separated from the UI lifecycle."},{"instruction":"Ok, now I have one class. public class MainActivity extends BaseDrawerActivity The menu works, but i need to use functions from StatsUtil.java: package com.HidiStudios.BeST.Utilities; import android.content.SharedPreferences; import android.widget.TextView; import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity; import com.HidiStudios.BeST.R; public class StatsUtil extends AppCompatActivity { protected TextView mTextView; protected String text; //stats protected static int bannerToggleCount = 0; protected static int interstitialWatchedCount = 0; protected static int interstitialClickedCount = 0; protected static int rewardedWatchedCount = 0; protected static int rewardedClickedCount = 0; protected void setStats(){ mTextView=findViewById(R.id.stats); text = getResources().getString(R.string.stats_message, bannerToggleCount, interstitialWatchedCount, interstitialClickedCount, rewardedWatchedCount, rewardedClickedCount); mTextView.setText(text); } protected void loadStats(){ SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences(\\"UserPreferences\\", MODE_PRIVATE); bannerToggleCount = sharedPreferences.getInt(\\"bannerToggleCount\\", 0); interstitialWatchedCount = sharedPreferences.getInt(\\"interstitialWatchedCount\\", 0); interstitialClickedCount = sharedPreferences.getInt(\\"interstitialClickedCount\\", 0); rewardedWatchedCount = sharedPreferences.getInt(\\"rewardedWatchedCount\\", 0); rewardedClickedCount = sharedPreferences.getInt(\\"rewardedClickedCount\\", 0); } private void saveStats(){ SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences(\\"UserPreferences\\", MODE_PRIVATE); SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit(); editor.putInt(\\"bannerToggleCount\\", bannerToggleCount); editor.putInt(\\"interstitialWatchedCount\\", interstitialWatchedCount); editor.putInt(\\"interstitialClickedCount\\", interstitialClickedCount); editor.putInt(\\"rewardedWatchedCount\\", rewardedWatchedCount); editor.putInt(\\"rewardedClickedCount\\", rewardedClickedCount); editor.apply(); } protected void updateStats(){ saveStats(); setStats(); } } How can I use these functions if MainActivity extends BaseDrawerActivity ?","output":"In Android development, a common practice to share functionality without inheritance is to use a utility class (like \`StatsUtil\`) by creating methods that don't depend on being tied to an \`Activity\` lifecycle or UI. Since \`StatsUtil\` extends \`AppCompatActivity\`, it seems to be structured more like an \`Activity\` itself rather than a utility class. However, we can refactor \`StatsUtil\` to be a true utility class. One way is to pass the necessary context or views to the methods in \`StatsUtil\` that require them: First, modify \`StatsUtil\` to not extend \`AppCompatActivity\` and remove any dependency on a specific activity's lifecycle: \`\`\`java package com.HidiStudios.BeST.Utilities; import android.content.Context; import android.content.SharedPreferences; import android.widget.TextView; public class StatsUtil { // stats private static int bannerToggleCount = 0; private static int interstitialWatchedCount = 0; private static int interstitialClickedCount = 0; private static int rewardedWatchedCount = 0; private static int rewardedClickedCount = 0; // Updated to use Context parameter instead of extending AppCompatActivity. public static void setStats(Context context, TextView statsTextView) { String text = context.getResources().getString(R.string.stats_message, bannerToggleCount, interstitialWatchedCount, interstitialClickedCount, rewardedWatchedCount, rewardedClickedCount); statsTextView.setText(text); } public static void loadStats(Context context) { SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = context.getSharedPreferences(\\"UserPreferences\\", Context.MODE_PRIVATE); bannerToggleCount = sharedPreferences.getInt(\\"bannerToggleCount\\", 0); // ... rest of the loading logic } public static void saveStats(Context context) { SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = context.getSharedPreferences(\\"UserPreferences\\", Context.MODE_PRIVATE); // ... rest of the saving logic } public static void updateStats(Context context, TextView statsTextView) { saveStats(context); setStats(context, statsTextView); } // Getter and setter methods for the stats if required... } \`\`\` Then in your \`MainActivity\`, you can use the methods of \`StatsUtil\` by passing the appropriate context and view references: \`\`\`java public class MainActivity extends BaseDrawerActivity { private TextView statsTextView; @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); initializeDrawer(); // Initialize TextView for stats and load stats statsTextView = findViewById(R.id.stats); StatsUtil.loadStats(this); StatsUtil.setStats(this, statsTextView); // When you need to update stats: StatsUtil.updateStats(this, statsTextView); } } \`\`\` This example assumes \`R.id.stats\` is the ID of a \`TextView\` in your \`activity_main.xml\` layout. By passing context, you're allowing \`StatsUtil\` to access resources and shared preferences as needed, and by passing the \`TextView\`, you're allowing it to manipulate the UI while avoiding tight coupling to an Activity class. Keep in mind that if you're accessing UI elements, you must make sure this is done on the UI thread. SharedPreferences can be accessed in the background, but updates to the UI must be done on the main thread. If you're updating stats in response to asynchronous events or background tasks, you'll have to use mechanisms like \`runOnUiThread()\` or \`Handler\` to make the changes on the UI thread. This approach keeps your \`StatsUtil\` decoupled from the \`Activity\` lifecycle while still allowing you to use its functionality from any part of your application that has access to a \`Context\`. This is a flexible and clean way of using utility functions in Android."},{"instruction":"For example, I have a function like this in MainActivity: private void showRewardedAds() { if (mRewardedAd!=null) { mRewardedAd.show(MainActivity.this, new OnUserEarnedRewardListener() { @Override public void onUserEarnedReward(@NonNull RewardItem rewardItem) { Log.d(\\"TagDB\\", \\"Reward earned!\\"); amount += getResources().getInteger(R.integer.onRewardedToggle); updateCoins(); changedSinceSynced = true; StatsUtil.rewardedWatchedCount++; StatsUtil.updateStats(this, statsTextView); } }); } else { Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,\\"Rewarded ad is not ready yet.

You can do this by using \`MainActivity.this\` instead of just \`this\`: \`\`\`java private void showRewardedAds() { if (mRewardedAd != null) { mRewardedAd.show(MainActivity.this, new OnUserEarnedRewardListener() { @Override public void onUserEarnedReward(@NonNull RewardItem rewardItem) { Log.d(\\"TagDB\\", \\"Reward earned!\\"); amount += getResources().getInteger(R.integer.onRewardedToggle); updateCoins(); changedSinceSynced = true; StatsUtil.rewardedWatchedCount++; // Use MainActivity.this to refer to the MainActivity context StatsUtil.updateStats(MainActivity.this, statsTextView); } }); } else { Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, \\"Rewarded ad is not ready yet. Try again!\\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } } \`\`\` This way, you're telling Java to use the instance of \`MainActivity\` when calling the \`updateStats\` method of \`StatsUtil\`. The compilation error should now be resolved, and your code should work as expected."},{"instruction":"as a manufacturing excellence guru, what are the key skills an operator should posess","output":"As a manufacturing excellence guru, you would focus on ensuring that operators possess a blend of technical, operational, and soft skills to excel in their roles.

You'll need to first set up a local development environment, then employ fuzzing tools, and finally analyze the results to identify any vulnerabilities. Here's a broad breakdown of what you would need to do: 1. **Setting Up the Environment**: - Install Truffle, if not already installed: \`npm install -g truffle\` - Initialize a new Truffle project in a new directory: \`truffle init\` - Copy the provided smart contract code into a \`.sol\` file within the \`contracts/\` directory of your Truffle project. - Install and configure the OpenZeppelin Test Helpers if needed, which could be useful for testing: \`npm install @openzeppelin/test-helpers\` 2. **Writing Truffle Test Scripts**: - Write test scripts in JavaScript or TypeScript using the Mocha testing framework and Chai for assertions that come with Truffle. - Use fuzzing techniques to provide unexpected, random, or invalid inputs to the smart contract methods. This can be done manually by creating a wide range of inputs (+ve, -ve, large numbers, 0, boundary values, special characters, etc.) or using a fuzzing tool like Echidna or ContractFuzzer. 3. **Fuzzing and Testing**: - Run your fuzzed inputs through the test scripts using \`truffle test\`. - Make sure to check for reentrancy attacks, overflow/underflow issues, improper access control, and other common smart contract vulnerabilities. - Look for unexpected behaviors or revert messages during the tests. 4. **Identifying Specific Vulnerabilities**: - Once you find a potential failure or unintended behavior, investigate the code to determine the cause of the vulnerability. - Some specific things to check in the contract: - Check the receive function and \`_initiateBridgeETH\` to ensure that the value and the sender checks are correctly implemented. - The \`finalizeBridgeETHDirect\` might bypass certain security checks because of direct finalization, so validate sender, amount, and recipient. - Verify that \`_initiateBridgeERC20\` correctly handles USDB transfers and accurately ensures the local and remote tokens' legitimacy. 5. **Static Analysis Tools**: - Use tools like Slither, MythX, or Securify on top of fuzzing to identify well-known vulnerabilities. 6. **Reporting and Fixing**: - Report any vulnerabilities found along with the scenarios in which they manifest. - Suggest fixes or improvements in the smart contract to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. It's important to note that without running a fuzzing test myself and without the full context or access to the associated smart contracts (like \`Predeploys.L2_CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSENGER\`), I cannot pinpoint specific vulnerabilities. The steps above provide a framework to start the fuzzing and testing process, which should be conducted with diligence to ensure the contract's security and integrity."},{"instruction":"npm install @openzeppelin/test-helpers npm ERR!

For this explanation, we'll create a basic fuzz test setup using Truffle's built-in testing capabilities for the Ethereum smart contract you provided. 1. **Initialize your Truffle Project**: Ensure you have an initialized Truffle project with the L2BlastBridge contract placed in the \`contracts\` directory. Also, ensure all the dependencies required by the contract (Predeploys, StandardBridge, etc.) are available. 2. **Install Truffle and Ganache**: You need to have Truffle installed globally and Ganache for running a local Ethereum blockchain. \`\`\`bash npm install -g truffle npm install -g ganache-cli \`\`\` 3. **Write a Test Script to Fuzz your Contract**: Create a test JavaScript file in the \`test\` directory of your Truffle project. Below is an example script to fuzz the \`finalizeBridgeETHDirect\` function of the contract: \`\`\`javascript const L2BlastBridge = artifacts.require(\\"L2BlastBridge\\"); // Fuzzer helper to generate random values function randomValue() { return Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000); } // Fuzzer helper to generate random Ethereum addresses const randomAddress = () => web3.utils.toChecksumAddress(web3.utils.randomHex(20)); contract('L2BlastBridge Fuzzing', accounts => { const [deployer, other] = accounts; before(async () => { this.instance = await L2BlastBridge.deployed(); }); // Fuzzing finalizeBridgeETHDirect for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { it(\`should handle incorrect values properly with random attempt {i+1}\`, async () => { let _from = randomAddress(); let _to = randomAddress(); let _amount = randomValue(); try { // We expect this to fail because msg.sender won't be the expected bridge address await this.instance.finalizeBridgeETHDirect(_from, _to, _amount, \\"0x00\\", {value: _amount}); assert.fail('Expected revert not received'); } catch (error) { assert(error.message.includes('revert'), \`Expected \\"revert\\", but instead got {error.message}\`); } }); } }); \`\`\` 4. **Run Ganache**: Start Ganache with a deterministic network setup. \`\`\`bash ganache-cli -d \`\`\` 5. **Run the Test Script with Truffle**: Execute the test script you created with Truffle. \`\`\`bash truffle test \`\`\` The script will simulate 10 test cases with random \`_from\`, \`_to\`, and \`_amount\` values. It checks whether they are handled correctly by the smart contract, specifically looking for reverts. 6. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: If the smart contract contains vulnerabilities, then during fuzzing, these tests may reveal unexpected behaviors such as function calls that succeed when they should fail, or vice versa. 7. **Assess Results**: Based on the test results and the failing tests, you should be able to identify contract functions that exhibit unintended behavior under certain input conditions or edge cases. 8. **Fix the Vulnerabilities**: After identifying a vulnerability, you should debug the contract to understand the root cause and update the code to mitigate the problem. Remember, this is just a basic example of fuzz testing a smart contract function to identify vulnerabilities. Fuzz testing can be more complex, depending on the number of functions, inputs, and contract complexity. You can also integrate more advanced fuzzing tools like Echidna to perform deeper and more nuanced testing."},{"instruction":"fuix this dose not give any result HD Wallet ================== Mnemonic: myth like bonus scare over problem client lizard pioneer submit female collect Base HD Path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/{account_index} Gas Price ================== 20000000000 Gas Limit ================== 6721975 Call Gas Limit ================== 9007199254740991 Listening on 127.0.0.1:8545 truffle test > truffle test > start exsit test 0F8bf6A479f320ead074411a4B0e7944Ea8c9C1 (100 ETH) > truffle test ganache-cli -d","output":"The output snippet you've provided seems to indicate that you've started \`ganache-cli\` with the \`-d\` flag for deterministic deployments and are attempting to run \`truffle test\` but not seeing any test results.

Without any tests, Truffle won't have anything to run. 2. **Incorrect File Extension**: Truffle test files should have a \`.js\` extension. For example: \`L2BlastBridge.test.js\`. 3. **Syntax or Import Error in Test Files**: If there's a syntax error, or an import error in the test file, that could prevent Truffle from properly executing the tests. 4. **Configuration Error**: Truffle configuration file (usually named \`truffle-config.js\` or \`truffle.js\`) should have a development network configured to connect to \`ganache-cli\`. Here's an example configuration for the development network: \`\`\`javascript module.exports = { networks: { development: { host: \\"127.0.0.1\\", port: 8545, network_id: \\"*\\", // Any network id accounts: 5, // Number of accounts to generate (optional) defaultEtherBalance: 500, // The balance of generated accounts in ether (optional) }, // ... other network configurations }, // ... rest of configuration }; \`\`\` 5. **Migrations Issue**: Ensure your smart contracts have been migrated to the blockchain correctly. You can deploy your contracts to the local ganache instance using \`truffle migrate\`. 6. **Testing Environment Issues**: Sometimes, previous test runs can leave the testing environment in a broken state. Try restarting \`ganache-cli\` and running \`truffle test\` again. Make sure that the test cases are correctly formatted and that asynchronous operations are properly awaited. Try running the tests with a more verbose output to get a better sense of what's happening: \`\`\`bash truffle test --show-events \`\`\` You can also use the \`--stacktrace-extra\` flag to get detailed stack traces for failed assertions without modifying your test scripts: \`\`\`bash truffle test --stacktrace-extra \`\`\` If you have a custom deployment script in \`migrations\` for \`L2BlastBridge\`, make sure it properly deploys and configures the contract.

Il suo scopo principale è quello di facilitare la comunicazione tra i dispositivi di rete sfruttando diverse tecnologie e protocolli. Una delle tecnologie fondamentali a livello di rete è l'incapsulamento IP. L'Internet Protocol (IP) è un protocollo di rete che fornisce un indirizzamento univoco per ogni dispositivo connesso a Internet e definisce il modo in cui i pacchetti di dati vengono indirizzati e consegnati. L'incapsulamento IP è il processo in cui i dati provenienti dai livelli superiori del modello OSI vengono divisi in pacchetti più piccoli chiamati datagrammi IP. Questi datagrammi includono l'indirizzo IP di origine e di destinazione, che viene utilizzato dai router per instradare i pacchetti sulla rete. Ogni pacchetto IP viene quindi incapsulato all'interno di un frame o di una trama specifica del livello di collegamento dei dati, come Ethernet o Wi-Fi, che fornisce informazioni aggiuntive per la consegna dei pacchetti a livello fisico. Un'importante caratteristica dell'incapsulamento IP è la sua natura \\"connectionless\\" o \\"senza connessione\\". Questo significa che ogni pacchetto viene inviato indipendentemente dagli altri, senza stabilire un canale di comunicazione dedicato tra l'host sorgente e l'host destinazione. Questo tipo di comunicazione senza connessione è significativo in quanto rende il protocollo IP altamente adattabile a diversi tipi di reti e situazioni, permettendo una maggiore flessibilità nella gestione del traffico di rete. Un'altra caratteristica dell'incapsulamento IP è la sua natura \\"best effort\\" o \\"a miglior impegno\\". Questo significa che IP non garantisce la consegna affidabile dei pacchetti. Poiché i pacchetti IP possono attraversare reti eterogenee e incontrare vari ostacoli lungo il percorso, non è garantito che tutti i pacchetti raggiungano la destinazione o che lo facciano nell'ordine in cui sono stati inviati. Questa caratteristica implica che il protocollo IP non fornisce meccanismi specifici per la gestione degli errori o il controllo di flusso, lasciando a livelli superiori l'onere di tali responsabilità, se necessario. Infine, l'incapsulamento IP è media-indipendente, il che significa che può essere utilizzato su diverse tipologie di reti, come reti cablate o reti wireless. IP offre un livello di astrazione che consente di comunicare indipendentemente dai dettagli specifici del mezzo fisico utilizzato. Ciò significa che gli stessi pacchetti IP possono essere inviati tramite cavi Ethernet o tramite onde radio Wi-Fi, mantenendo la stessa struttura di base e gli stessi metodi di instradamento."},{"instruction":"quindi mentre il livello di rete assegna un Indirizzo IP che rappresenta il dispositivo nella rete il livello di collegamento dati usa l'indirizzo MAC che indica la parte hardware del dispositivo a cui è stato assegnato precedentemente l'indirizzo IP","output":"Esattamente. Nel contesto del livello di rete, viene assegnato un indirizzo IP a ogni dispositivo connesso alla rete. L'indirizzo IP identifica in modo univoco il dispositivo a livello logico, consentendo ai pacchetti di essere instradati correttamente da un host sorgente a un host destinazione sulla rete. D'altra parte, nel livello di collegamento dati, viene utilizzato l'indirizzo MAC (Media Access Control) per identificare la parte hardware di un dispositivo di rete. L'indirizzo MAC, anche noto come indirizzo fisico, è un identificatore univoco assegnato alla scheda di interfaccia di rete (NIC) di un dispositivo. L'indirizzo MAC è utilizzato a livello di collegamento dati dai protocolli come Ethernet per consentire la comunicazione diretta tra dispositivi sulla stessa rete locale. È importante notare che l'indirizzo MAC viene utilizzato solo all'interno della stessa rete locale, mentre l'indirizzo IP viene utilizzato per instradare i pacchetti su reti più ampie, consentendo la comunicazione tra reti diverse. Nel processo di incapsulamento, quando i pacchetti IP vengono inviati alla rete, vengono incapsulati all'interno di frame che includono l'indirizzo MAC di origine e di destinazione. In questo modo, i pacchetti possono essere consegnati direttamente ai dispositivi desiderati sulla stessa rete utilizzando l'indirizzo MAC corrispondente. In sostanza, il livello di rete si occupa dell'indirizzamento logico dei dispositivi utilizzando l'indirizzo IP, mentre il livello di collegamento dati si occupa dell'indirizzamento fisico dei dispositivi utilizzando l'indirizzo MAC. Entrambi svolgono un ruolo cruciale nella comunicazione efficace dei dati all'interno di una rete."},{"instruction":"quindi alla rete interessa solo la parte software tra virgolette?","output":"No, non è del tutto corretto dire che alla rete interessa solo la parte software. La rete comprende sia aspetti software che hardware. Dal punto di vista software, il livello di rete si occupa di gestire il protocollo IP, l'instradamento dei pacchetti e altre funzionalità di rete. Inoltre, ci sono diversi protocolli di rete che operano a livello di rete, come il protocollo di controllo degli indirizzi di rete (ARP) per tradurre gli indirizzi IP in indirizzi MAC, il protocollo di gestione degli indirizzi IP (DHCP) per assegnare dinamicamente gli indirizzi IP ai dispositivi e così via. Tuttavia, la rete non si limita solo a componenti software. Ci sono anche componenti hardware essenziali per il funzionamento della rete. Questi includono router, switch, hub, cavi Ethernet, schede di interfaccia di rete (NIC) e dispositivi di rete wireless. Questi componenti hardware consentono di trasmettere i pacchetti dati sulla rete, connettere i dispositivi tra loro e fornire la connettività fisica necessaria per la comunicazione dei dati. In sintesi, la rete abbraccia sia la parte software che la parte hardware per garantire la comunicazione dei dati tra dispositivi nella rete. Sia gli aspetti software che quelli hardware sono fondamentali per il funzionamento e la gestione efficace delle reti."},{"instruction":"perchè dover usare un indirizzo IP quando si ha un indirizzo MAC?","output":"L'uso di un indirizzo IP anziché solo un indirizzo MAC è necessario per diversi motivi: 1. Scalabilità e gestione delle reti: Gli indirizzi IP forniscono uno schema di indirizzamento gerarchico che consente la suddivisione della rete in reti più piccole, sottoreti e sotto-sottoreti. Ciò consente una maggiore flessibilità nella gestione delle reti, permettendo la divisione del traffico di rete, la riduzione del sovraccarico delle tabelle di instradamento e l'implementazione di politiche di sicurezza e controllo di accesso più granulari. 2. Comunicazione su reti diverse: Gli indirizzi IP consentono la comunicazione su reti locali (LAN) diverse e su reti wide area (WAN), come Internet. All'interno di una rete locale, l'indirizzo MAC è sufficiente per la comunicazione diretta tra dispositivi, ma quando si tratta di inviare dati su reti diverse, è necessario utilizzare il protocollo IP per instradare e consegnare i pacchetti ai dispositivi corretti sulla rete. 3. Indirizzamento unico: Gli indirizzi IP sono unici a livello globale, il che significa che ogni dispositivo connesso a Internet deve avere un indirizzo IP unico per consentire la comunicazione su scala globale. Al contrario, gli indirizzi MAC sono unici solo all'interno di una rete locale. Quando i pacchetti sono inviati su Internet, l'indirizzo IP permette ai router di instradare correttamente i pacchetti verso la destinazione desiderata. 4. Abstraction Layer: Un altro motivo importante per l'uso di indirizzi IP è la necessità di creare uno strato di astrazione tra il livello fisico (indirizzi MAC) e il livello di rete. Gli indirizzi IP permettono di identificare i dispositivi a un livello logico e consentono la separazione delle funzionalità di rete dalla tecnologia fisica sottostante, facilitando l'interoperabilità e la gestione delle reti. In sintesi, l'uso di indirizzi IP è necessario per consentire una comunicazione scalabile, inter-rete e globale, garantendo un indirizzamento unico e offrendo un'astrazione tra il livello fisico e il livello di rete. Gli indirizzi MAC, invece, sono utilizzati per la comunicazione diretta all'interno di una rete locale. Entrambi gli indirizzi svolgono un ruolo fondamentale nella comunicazione dei dati, ma in contesti e scopi diversi."},{"instruction":"quindi l'indirizzo MAC non basta per rappresentare un dispositivo in tutte le altre reti","output":"Esatto, l'indirizzo MAC da solo non basta per rappresentare un dispositivo in tutte le altre reti. L'indirizzo MAC è un identificatore univoco assegnato alla scheda di interfaccia di rete (NIC) di un dispositivo specifico ed è utilizzato per la comunicazione diretta all'interno di una rete locale. Tuttavia, quando si tratta di comunicare tra reti diverse, è necessario utilizzare l'indirizzo IP, che permette di instradare e consegnare i pacchetti ai dispositivi nella rete desiderata, indipendentemente dal loro indirizzo MAC. Gli indirizzi IP forniscono un livello di astrazione che consente la comunicazione su diverse reti, inclusa la rete Internet. In pratica, quando un pacchetto IP viene inviato da un dispositivo sorgente a un dispositivo destinazione su una rete, il pacchetto viene incapsulato in un frame o una trama di livello di collegamento (come Ethernet) che include l'indirizzo MAC del dispositivo sorgente e il dispositivo destinazione all'interno della stessa rete locale. Tuttavia, quando il pacchetto raggiunge un router per essere instradato verso un'altra rete, il frame originale viene rimosso e viene creato un nuovo frame che contiene l'indirizzo MAC del router come mittente e l'indirizzo MAC del router successivo o del destinatario finale come destinatario. In conclusione, mentre l'indirizzo MAC identifica un dispositivo specifico su una rete locale, l'indirizzo IP offre un meccanismo più potente per identificare e instradare i pacchetti su reti diverse e consentire una comunicazione su larga scala."},{"instruction":"quindi il layer di rete aggiunge un header al segmento che contiene il protocollo IP e successivamente si occupa dell'incapsulamento di tale segmento in un pacchetto che può essere IPV4 o IPV6","output":"Sì, esatto. Nel layer di rete, il protocollo IP viene utilizzato per aggiungere un header al segmento di dati dei livelli superiori (come il segmento di trasporto TCP o UDP) per creare il pacchetto IP. L'header IP contiene informazioni come l'indirizzo IP di origine e di destinazione, la versione del protocollo IP utilizzata (IPV4 o IPV6), la lunghezza del pacchetto, il campo di checksum per la verifica dell'integrità dei dati e altre informazioni necessarie per l'instradamento e la consegna del pacchetto. La versione più comune di IP è l'IPv4 (Internet Protocol versione 4), che utilizza indirizzi IP di 32 bit. Tuttavia, con il crescente esaurimento degli indirizzi IPv4, è stato introdotto anche l'IPv6 (Internet Protocol versione 6), che utilizza indirizzi IP di 128 bit per consentire un numero molto maggiore di indirizzi disponibili. Quando un segmento di dati viene incapsulato in un pacchetto IP, il pacchetto può essere formato sia in formato IPv4 che in formato IPv6, a seconda del protocollo IP utilizzato. L'incapsulamento del segmento all'interno del pacchetto IP consente la trasmissione dei dati attraverso reti eterogenee e l'instradamento dei pacchetti in base agli indirizzi IP associati a ciascun pacchetto. In conclusione, il pacchetto IP è creato nel livello di rete aggiungendo un header IP al segmento dei livelli superiori e viene scelto il formato IPv4 o IPv6 a seconda del protocollo IP utilizzato."},{"instruction":"IPV4 ha 32 bit mentre IPV6 ne ha 128?","output":"Mi scuso per l'errore nella mia risposta precedente. Hai assolutamente ragione. L'IPv4 utilizza indirizzi IP di 32 bit, mentre l'IPv6 utilizza indirizzi IP di 128 bit. Grazie per avermi corretto."},{"instruction":"IPV6 139 undicilioni","output":"Corretto, IPv6 utilizza indirizzi IP di 128 bit, quindi offre un numero molto più elevato di combinazioni rispetto all'IPv4. In particolare, IPv6 consente un totale di circa 3,4 x 10^38, o circa 340 undecilioni, di indirizzi IP unici. Questo enorme spazio di indirizzamento è stato introdotto per risolvere il problema dell'esaurimento degli indirizzi IPv4 e per supportare la crescente domanda di dispositivi connessi a Internet."},{"instruction":"Asset Allocation Overview Detail BECAT’s asset allocation strategy and how it reflects its sustainability commitments. Highlight key sectors of investment and how they align with ESG objectives.","output":"Unfortunately, I don't have access to company-specific information such as BECAT's asset allocation strategy, largely because BECAT seems to be a fictional entity or a specific acronym that may refer to various contexts, none of which are widespread or publicly known investment entities. However, I can provide a general overview of what an asset allocation strategy that reflects sustainability commitments might look like and how it could align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives. An asset allocation strategy is a blueprint for dividing an investment portfolio among various asset categories such as stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and private equity. The strategy reflects an investor or institution's risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. When designed to reflect sustainability commitments, the strategy seeks not only to achieve financial returns but also to have a positive impact on society and the environment. Here is how an ESG-aligned asset allocation strategy could generally be structured across key sectors: 1. **Equities**: - **Renewable Energy**: Prioritizing investments in companies that develop or use renewable energy technologies. - **Clean Technology**: Investing in firms that offer products or services that enhance energy efficiency. - **Green Building and Infrastructure**: Allocating funds to companies involved in sustainable construction and infrastructure. 2. **Fixed Income**: - **Green Bonds**: Bonds issued for funding environmentally friendly projects. - **Social Bonds**: Bonds intended to finance projects with positive social outcomes. - **Sustainability Bonds**: Bonds whose proceeds are used for both green and social projects. 3. **Real Estate**: - **Sustainable Real Estate Funds**: These would invest in properties with high energy efficiency and lower carbon footprints. - **REITs Focused on Sustainability**: Real Estate Investment Trusts that adhere to high ESG standards. 4. **Alternative Investments**: - **Impact Investing Funds**: Direct investments into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return. - **Private Equity Focused on ESG**: Private equity funds that target companies with strong sustainability practices or focus on transforming companies to become more sustainable. - **ESG Themed ETFs and Mutual Funds**: Exchange-Traded Funds and mutual funds that focus on sustainability themes. 5. **Commodities**: - **Sustainable Agriculture**: Investment in sustainable farming practices can be a critical part of an ESG portfolio. - **Environmental Credits**: Trading in carbon credits, renewable energy certificates, or water rights. 6. **Cash or Cash Equivalents**: - **ESG Money Market Funds**: Funds that invest in short-term debt securities of issuers with high ESG ratings. For an asset allocation strategy like the hypothetical BECAT's to be effective in reflecting sustainability commitments, ongoing due diligence and monitoring of investments are necessary. BECAT would need to employ stringent screening criteria to ensure compliance with ESG objectives and possibly engage with portfolio companies to improve their ESG performance. Incorporating ESG considerations into an investment strategy may also involve actively investing in companies that are leaders in sustainability practices, as well as avoiding investments in companies with poor ESG records or in industries that are considered not sustainable, such as fossil fuels or tobacco. Ultimately, a sustainable asset allocation strategy seeks not only to reduce risk and potentially enhance returns but also to positively influence societal and environmental outcomes. This could involve promoting social justice, accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, and fostering inclusive growth and sustainable development."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've become friends with some of the locals. One such local was Charlotte - a young goblin from the remote countryside. She has long coral-red hair, gorgeous amber eyes, a cyan tongue, a farmer's outfit, and a voluptuous chest - which gently rose & fell with each movement of her torso & every step she took. In terms of height, Charlotte was about as tall as a human girl; and had a beautiful face to match - however, she also had some shark-like teeth to match her goblin traits. And out of all the women here in Drakenburg, she unarguably had the biggest chest - it was so big she had to sleep on her side. And, surprisingly, she didn't mind when I bury my head into her chest and use it like a pillow for bed. This was mostly because Charlotte's bed was large enough to fit to people - and it became clear why her parents chose a bed like this; seeing as her chest was practically an built-in pillow.)","output":"One sunny afternoon, I decided to pay Charlotte a visit at her cozy little cottage in the countryside. I knocked on her wooden door, and she opened it with a wide smile. \\"Hey there, friend! Come on in,\\" Charlotte greeted me warmly, her amber eyes twinkling with excitement. \\"Thanks, Charlotte. I brought some fresh fruits from the market. Thought we could have a snack together.\\" I handed her the basket filled with juicy oranges and succulent strawberries. \\"Wow, this is amazing! You're such a thoughtful friend,\\" she exclaimed, her cyan tongue flicking out to lick her lips in anticipation. We settled down at her wooden table and began munching on the delicious fruits, conversing about our adventures in this fantasy world. Charlotte's laughter filled the room as she shared some amusing anecdotes about her encounters with mischievous fairies and daring escapades in the enchanted forest. \\"What have you been up to, my friend?\\" she asked, biting into a strawberry and savoring its sweetness. \\"Well, I've been exploring the nearby villages, meeting interesting characters, and trying to unravel the mysteries of this enchanting world,\\" I replied. \\"Sounds thrilling! You always manage to find excitement wherever you go,\\" Charlotte remarked, a mischievous glint in her eyes. I grinned and leaned back in my chair. \\"Well, in a world as fantastical as this, it's hard not to get caught up in the magic. Speaking of which, how have you been? Any new farming adventures?\\" Charlotte leaned forward, her coral-red hair cascading over her shoulders as she animatedly shared about how she had managed to grow the juiciest watermelons in Drakenburg. Her passion for farming was evident as she described the hours of hard work she put into ensuring her crops thrived. As the day turned into evening, we moved to the living room, where she showed me her collection of rare books and artifacts. She pointed towards a painting on the wall, depicting a majestic dragon soaring through a starlit sky. \\"That dragon painting has always fascinated me. The artist captured the essence of its power and grace,\\" I mused, gazing at the artwork. Charlotte's eyes sparkled with excitement. \\"My grandmother used to tell me stories about dragons, their ancient wisdom, and their connection to magic. Sometimes, I wish I could witness their magnificent presence.\\" Just then, a soft breeze blew through the open window, causing the curtains to dance. We sat in silence for a moment, taking in the gentle evening atmosphere. \\"You know, [your name], it's been so wonderful having you as my friend. I never thought I'd meet someone like you in this world,\\" Charlotte said softly, her voice tinged with gratitude. I smiled, feeling a deep connection with this kind-hearted goblin. \\"The feeling is mutual, Charlotte. Together, we've created memories that will last a lifetime. And no matter where our journeys take us, our friendship will endure.\\" As night fell and the moon bathed the room in a soft glow, we bid each other goodnight. Charlotte led me to her spacious bedroom, complete with a large, comfortable bed. \\"Feel free to make yourself at home. You can rest your head on my chest if you'd like,\\" Charlotte offered, gesturing to her ample bosom with a playful smirk. Chuckling, I accepted her invitation and snuggled comfortably against her pillows. As I drifted off to sleep, the sound of her gentle breathing and the rhythm of her heartbeat lulled me into a peaceful slumber. In this enchanting fantasy world, true friendships knew no boundaries, whether they be with goblins, elves, or humans like me. And as I closed my eyes, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the extraordinary bond I had found with Charlotte - a friendship that transcended physical appearances and embraced the magic of acceptance and understanding."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artAnime Luffy","output":"Anime Luffy | One Piece-Inspired Graphic | Versatile Design for T-Shirts, Mugs, Prints | Anime Fan Art | Unique Gift Idea for Otaku"},{"instruction":".","output":"Hello!

Here's a simplified explanation of the process: 1. **Directory Servers (Authorities):** - Tor has a set of trusted directory authority servers whose main role is to maintain a list of active Tor relays. These directory authority nodes vote to produce a consensus document every hour, containing information about all the currently operating Tor nodes, including their IP addresses, public keys, exit policies, and other relevant data. 2. **Bootstrap Process:** - When you first start the Tor Browser, it performs a bootstrap process. During this process, the browser contacts one of the directory authorities or a fallback directory mirror to download the most recent consensus document, along with the necessary certificates to verify the integrity and authenticity of the information received. 3. **Connection via Guard Relay:** - To build a circuit for sending traffic through the Tor network, the Tor client software first picks a guard relay (entry node), which is a special type of relay that a client uses as the first hop in its circuit. These guard relays are chosen for their stability, bandwidth, and trustworthiness. 4. **Circuit Creation:** - After choosing a guard relay, the Tor client software proceeds to select additional middle (also known as intermediate) relays and then typically picks an exit relay based on the desired characteristics of the circuit (such as country location, bandwidth, or whether the exit node permits the traffic to go to a particular destination). The client requests encrypted sessions with each relay, ensuring that each relay only knows about its immediate predecessor and successor in the circuit, but no relay knows the complete path. 5. **Dynamic Circuit Creation:** - If the network landscape changes (for example, relays go offline or new relays appear), the directory authorities will reflect that in their updated consensus documents. The Tor client typically fetches a new consensus document every 2-4 hours or when it needs to create new circuits, thereby staying updated with the current state of the Tor network. 6. **Path Selection Criteria:** - The Tor client also adheres to certain path selection rules that help reinforce privacy and security, such as not selecting relays that are in the same family (i.e., relays that are controlled by the same operator) or in the same /16 subnet for the same circuit. This directory-based system allows the Tor Browser to dynamically find and select the best possible path through the Tor network for a user's connection needs, thus enabling anonymous and private browsing on the internet."},{"instruction":"Create a humorous scam-baiting response, in the style of Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner series, to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

[संगीत] दोस्तों बहुत समय पहले की बात है एक युवक एक गुरु के पास जाता है और उनसे जाकर बोलता है कि हे गुरुदेव मैं काफी समय से बहुत ही बीमार रहने लगा हूं मेरा शरीर ठीक से काम ही नहीं करता उसमें ऊर्जा ही नहीं रहती मैं हमेशा ही थका थका सा महसूस करता हूं मेरा किसी भी काम में मन नहीं लगता अब आप ही बताइए आखिर मैं ऐसा क्या करूं जिससे मेरी सारी बीमारियां दूर हो जाए और मुझे कोई दवा ना लेनी पड़े और किसी भी चिक के पास जाने की जरूरत ही ना पड़े क्योंकि मेरे पास इतना धन नहीं है कि मैं चिकित्सक के पास जाकर अपना इलाज करवा सकूं मैं चिकित्सक से दवाई ले लेकर के परेशान हो चुका हूं लेकिन फिर भी मेरी सेहत में कुछ भी सुधार नहीं हो रहा है इसलिए अब आप ही मुझे कुछ ऐसा उपाय बताइए जिससे कि मैं ठीक हो जाऊं और मुझे किसी डॉक्टर के पास या किसी वैद्य के पास जाने की जरूरत ही ना पड़े और महंगी महंगी दवाइयों से भी मुझे छुटकारा मिल जाए युवक की पूरी बात सुनने के बाद गुरु मुस्कुराए और उससे बोलते हैं कि बेटा हमारे शरीर के भीतर एक ऐसा डॉक्टर मौजूद है जो पूरी रात हमारी बीमारियों को ठीक करता है हमारे शरीर को रिचार्ज करता है हमारे दिमाग को फ्रेश करता है आपको जवान और निरोगी रखने में आपकी मदद करता है और एक ऐसा डॉक्टर है जिसकी दवाइयां बिल्कुल मुफ्त हैं और उसका कोई नुकसान भी नहीं है गुरु की बात सुनकर युवक चौक जाता है और गुरु से आश्चर्य से पूछता है कि कैसे गुरुदेव आप मुझे जरा विस्तार से बताइए फिर गुरु उस व्यक्ति को समझा ते हुए कहते हैं कि बेटा अब तुम मेरी बात को ध्यान से सुनो आज जो तरीका मैं तुम्हें बताऊंगा अगर तुम उसका अनुसरण करते रहोगे तो तुम जीवन भर बीमार नहीं होगे युवक गुरु की बातों को उत्सुकता से सुनने लगता है फिर गुरु ने कहना शुरू किया बेटा जिस डॉक्टर की बात मैं कर रहा हूं वह डॉक्टर तुम्हारी नींद में है या हमारी बीमारियों को ठीक करते हैं यह डॉक्टर हमारी नींद में होते हैं नींद में ही यह डॉक्टर हमारी बीमारियों को ठीक करते हैं जब हम सोते हैं तो यह डॉक्टर हमारी बीमारियों को ठीक करते हैं और अगर वह सही से काम नहीं करते तो आपका शरीर बूढ़ा और बीमार पड़ने लगता है लेकिन अगर तुम मेरी बातों पर अमल करो तो तुम्हारा शरीर पूरी तरह से नींद में ही बीमारियों को ठीक करने लगेगा अब तुम नींद के बारे में ध्यान से समझो कि आखिर नींद में हमारे अंदर ऐसा क्या होता है क्या यह प्राकृतिक उपचार होता है आपने यह बिल्कुल सुना होगा कि जिसकी नींद अच्छी नहीं होती है उसकी वह उत्पादक क्षमता नहीं रहती है जो होनी चाहिए जिससे बहुत सारी बीमारियों से घेर लेती हैं जैसे हार्ट अटैक ब्लड प्रेशर शुगर कोलेस्ट्रॉल इत्यादि फिर गुरु उस व्यक्ति को पहली बात बताते हुए कहते हैं कि नींद में हमारा शरीर किस तरह से डॉक्टर बनता है और हमारी बीमारियों को कैसे ठीक करता है जरा ध्यान से सुनो नींद में आपका शरीर और आपका दिमाग बिल्कुल रिलैक्स होता है जब आप गहरी नींद में जाते हैं तो आपके दिमाग के न्यूरॉन्स की एक्टिविटी कम हो जाती है और जब न्यूरॉन्स की एक्टिविटी कम हो जाती है तो आपके दिमाग की ऊर्जा भी कम हो जाती है और उसी समय आपके दिमाग के पास मौका रहता है कि वह अपने आप को रिचार्ज कर सके और जो अव्य उसके पास खत्म हो चुके हैं उसको वह वापस ला सके और जो भी जहर आपके शरीर में बना है आपके दिमाग में बना है उसको नष्ट कर सके उसकी सफाई कर सके और ऐसे ही हमारे मसल्स के साथ भी होता है अधिकतर लोग जब सोते हैं तो उनमें एक टेंशन सी होती है और उस टेंशन के लिए उनका शरीर ऊर्जा खर्च करता रहता है लेकिन जब आप नींद में सो जाते हैं तो आपकी मसल्स रिलैक्स हो जाती है और आपका शरीर भी रिलैक्स हो जाता है जिससे वहां की सफाई फिर से चालू हो जाती है यानी कि रिचार्जिंग एक्टिवेट हो जाती है और जैसे ही आप गहरी नींद में जाते हैं तो मसल से ज्यादा ब्लड फ्लो होता है और यह ब्लड फ्लो आपकी मसल्स को रिचार्ज करता है और आपकी मसल्स को पावरफुल बनाता है और जो भी टूटी फूटी मसल्स हैं टूटी फूटी कोशिकाएं होती हैं उनको रिपेयर करने में यह तुम्हारा शरीर नींद में मदद करता है फिर गुरु उस युवक से दूसरी बात बताते हुए कहते हैं कि गहरी नींद में हमारे शरीर में ग्रोथ हार्मोन का स्राव होता है ग्रोथ हार्मोंस जो कि हमारी पिट्यूटरी ग्लैंड में होता है इसी हार्मोंस के कारण तुम्हारे शरीर में अगर कहीं भी टूटी फूटी कोशिकाएं हैं तो यह हार्मोन उन टूटी-फूटी कोशिकाओं का रिपेयर करती है और दूसरी बात यह है कि आपका शरीर बढ़ने के लिए बना है ग्रो होने के लिए बना है जिन लोगों में ग्रोथ रुक जाती है तो वे लोग जल्दी बूढ़े होने लगते हैं उन की त्वचा रूखी रूखी हो जाती है जिसका कारण यह है कि आप गहरी नींद में नहीं जा पा रहे हैं और आपकी गहरी नींद नहीं हो पा रही है इसी कारण ग्रोथ हार्मोन पूरी तरीके से रिलीज नहीं हो पाता लेकिन अगर आप अपनी नींद को गहरा कर ले तो यह हार्मोन अच्छे तरीके से आपके शरीर में स्रावित होने लगेगा और आपके शरीर में जितनी भी टूटी-फूटी कोशिकाएं होंगी उसकी मरम्मत होती जाएगी फिर गुरु उस युवक को तीसरी बात बताते हुए कहते हैं कि हमारा शरीर गहरी नींद में अनशन से मुक्त रह हता है हमारे जीवन में हर रोज अनेक गतिविधियां होती हैं और चुनौतियों के कारण तनाव और कोलेस्ट्रॉल का लेवल बढ़ जाता है जिसके कारण शरीर फालतू की इमरजेंसी मोड में रहता है जिससे 95 पर ऊर्जा खत्म हो जाती है जिसके कारण आप लगातार बीमार पड़ने लगते हैं और आपकी बीमारियां बढ़ जाती हैं हमारे शरीर में 95 पर बीमारियां मानसिक तनाव के कारण पैदा होती हैं लेकिन वहीं जिस इंसान की गहरी नींद होती है उसमें कोलेस्ट्रॉल का लेवल घटना लगता है और जब कोलेस्ट्रॉल का लेवल घटता है तो आपके दिमाग और आपके शरीर के पास एक संदेश लेकर जाता है कि डरने की कोई बात नहीं है रिलैक्स रहो और जीवन को मजे से जियो इसलिए अच्छी और गहरी नींद बहुत आवश्यक होती है फिर गुरु उस युवक को चौथा तरीका बताते हुए कहते हैं कि गहरी नींद से आपके शरीर में रोग प्रतिरोधक क्षमता बढ़ जाती है रोग प्रतिरोधक क्षमता को दो ही चीजें कंट्रोल करती हैं एक है आपका स्ट्रेस और दूसरा है आपकी अच्छी नींद कुछ लोग मौसम के बदलाव से बहुत जल्द बीमार पड़ जाते हैं इसका कारण यह है कि उनकी रोग प्रतिरोधक क्षमता कमजोर है लेकिन जब गहरी नींद आती है तो रोग प्रतिरोधक क्षमता जो कि हमारे शरीर का सिपाही बोलते हैं वे सारे के सारे सक्रिय हो जाते हैं जिससे प्रतिरक्षा प्रणाली अपना काम अच्छे से कर पाती है जिससे आपके रोग प्रतिरोधक क्षमता बढ़ जाती है शरीर बढ़ने लगता है शरीर में मजबूती आती शरीर में ऊर्जा आती है और आप खुश रहने लगते हैं और वहीं जिनकी नींद गहरी नहीं होती है उनकी रोग प्रतिरोधक क्षमता ठीक से काम नहीं करती यह वही बात हो गई कि आपके पास सेना तो है और आपने लड़ने के लिए भेज दिया लेकिन वह दुश्मन को नहीं पहचानते कि कौन उनका दुश्मन है कौन नहीं और इसी के कारण आपके शरीर में बहुत सारी बीमारियां पैदा हो जाती हैं लेकिन सिर्फ गहरी नींद से आप अपने भीतर के डॉक्टर को जगाकर इन सभी बीमारियों को ठीक कर सकते हैं मैं यह नहीं कि कह रहा कि इन बीमारियों के 100% कारण यही है लेकिन काफी हद तक गहरी नींद आपको अनेक बीमारियों से छुटकारा दिलाती है फिर गुरुजी पांचवां तरीका बताते हुए कहते हैं कि गहरी नींद से हमारे हैप्पीनेस केमिकल रिलीज होते हैं जब भी आप अपनी आंखें बंद करते हैं और अंधेरा होता है तो हमारे ब्रेन को एक मैसेज आता है जिससे शरीर एक्टिवेट हो जाता है कि अब अंधेरा हो गया है और तब आपका पीनियल ग्लैंड एक केमिकल निकालता है जिसे मेलाटोनिन कहते हैं मेलाटोनिन के कारण शरीर की हीलिंग होती है और शरीर रिचार्ज होता है और आपकी नींद बहुत ही अच्छी और बहुत ही गहरी आती है मेलाटोनिन से ही हैप्पीनेस केमिकल्स भी बनता है कहने का मतलब यह है कि जब गहरी आती है मेलाटोनिन से ही हैप्पीनेस केमिकल्स भी बनता है कहने का मतलब यह है कि जब आप अपनी स्लीप साइकिल को बैलेंस रखते हैं तो इसके कारण शरीर अपने आप ही बीमारियों को ठीक करना शुरू कर देता है इसके बाद में वह युवक उन गुरु से कहता है कि गुरुदेव मैं यह तो समझ गया कि गहरी नींद में किस तरीके से हम हमारा शरीर हमारी बीमारियों को ठीक करता है लेकिन अब आप मुझे यह बताइए कि हम गहरी नींद कैसे ले सकते हैं और गहरी नींद लेने के लिए हमें क्या उपाय करना चाहिए युवक की बात सुनकर गुरुजी कहते हैं कि बेटा गहरी नींद में जाने के लिए हमें यह उपाय करने पड़ते हैं अब जो मैं तुम्हें बताऊंगा तुम उसे ध्यान से सुनो अधिकतर लोग गहरी नींद में जा ही नहीं पाते जिसके कारण उनका शरीर बीमारियों को ठीक नहीं कर पाता क्योंकि कच्ची नींद में आपकी मसल्स में ब्लड फ्लो अच्छे से नहीं हो पाता कोलेस्ट्रॉल कम नहीं होता है और आपका शरीर रिफ्रेश नहीं हो पाता है आप तरोताजा नहीं महसूस कर पाते हैं जिससे आपके शरीर में अनेक बीमारियां पैदा हो जाती हैं इसलिए गहरी नींद में जाने के लिए आपको सबसे पहले यह काम करने चाहिए कि सोने से एक दो घंटे पहले आपको अपने कमरे में अंधेरा करना है आप जो भी लाइट जलाकर रखते हैं उसे एक दो घंटे पहले ही बंद कर दीजिए क्योंकि अगर उजाला रहेगा तो आपके दिमाग में यह संदेश जाता रहेगा कि यह जागने का समय है और जिससे मेलाटोनिन नहीं बनेगा और मेलाटोनिन ही हमें गहरी नींद में लेकर जाता है दूसरा काम आपको रात में मोबाइल से नहीं चलाना है क्योंकि मोबाइल से जो नीली लाइट आपकी आंखों में जाती है जिससे आपके दिमाग को यह संदेश जाता है कि अी सोने का समय नहीं हुआ है इसलिए जब हम देर रात तक मोबाइल चलाते हैं तो हमें या तो ठीक से नींद नहीं आती है या तो अच्छी नींद आती ही नहीं इसलिए सोने के दो-तीन घंटे पहले ही मोबाइल को बंद करके रख देना है जिससे आपको गहरी नींद आए गहरी नींद में जाने के लिए तीसरा काम आपको यह करना है कि आपको सोने से तीन घंटे पहले ही खाना खा लेना है जैन समाज में लोग रात को खाना नहीं खाते क्योंकि जब हम पेट भर के खाना खा लेते हैं तो हमारी प्राण शक्ति उस खाने को पचाने में लग जाती है और वह लगी ही रहती है जिससे उसे हमारे शरीर को बीमारियों को ठीक करने का समय ही नहीं मिल पाता इसीलिए बहुत ज्यादा तेल मसाले वाला खाना भी शाम को नहीं खाना चाहिए क्योंकि जब मसालेदार खाना आपके पेट में जाता है तो वह ठीक से पचता नहीं है और उससे हमारे ब्लड में एसिडिटी बढ़ जाती है और पाचन भी हमारा दुरुस्त नहीं होता है जिससे शरीर और बीमार होने लगता है मसालेदार खाना खाने से हमें कच्ची डकार भी आती है एसिडिटी होती है इसलिए सोने के तीन-चार घंटे पहले ही हमें खाना खा लेना चाहिए और हमें कम मसालेदार खाना ही खाना चाहिए और जो लोग सोने से पहले हल्का भोजन करते हैं मोबाइल का इस्तेमाल नहीं करते हैं और अपने परिवार के साथ समय बिताते हैं उनको अच्छी और गहरी नींद जरूर आती है इसलिए सोने से पहले अपने परिवार वालों से बातचीत जरूर करें किताबें पढ़ें म्यूजिक सुन सकते हैं हंसी मजाक कर सकते हैं इससे आपको अच्छी नींद जरूर आएगी गहरी नींद में जाने के लिए चौथा काम आपको यह करना है कि आपको चिंताओं से दूर रहना है जो लोग परिवार वालों के साथ ना होकर अकेले होते हैं वह चिंता को साथ लेकर रोते हैं और वह अकेले में पड़े पड़े यही सोचते रहते हैं कि आज क्या हुआ कल क्या हुआ आगे क्या होगा बस इसी तरह से चिंता को अपने सिर पर लादे रखते हैं सोते समय जो विचार उनके दिमाग में चलते रहते हैं उन्हें वह विचार पूरी रात ठीक से सोने ही नहीं देते जब वह लोग सुबह उठेंगे तो भी वही विचार उनके दिमाग में चलते रहते हैं जिससे उनका पूरा दिन तनावपूर्ण रहता है और उनको ठीक से रात में नींद भी नहीं आती है इसलिए सोने से ठीक पहले योग निद्रा का अभ्यास करें और अच्छी बातें सोचें खुद को अच्छी बातें बोलें और जब आप घर पर आ जाएं तो आप ऑफिस की बातें या कहीं की बातें सब भूल जाइए केवल केवल आप अपने परिवार के साथ समय बिताएं और अच्छी बात सोचते हुए अपने बिस्तर पर सोने का प्रयास करें क्योंकि अगर आपके दिमाग में नकारात्मक विचार आएंगे तो वह आपको तनाव ही देंगे और अगर आपके दिमाग में सकारात्मक विचार रहेंगे तो वह सकारात्मक विचार आपके जीवन का निर्माण करेंगे और आप तनाव मुक्त रहेंगे और आप चिंताओं से भी दूर रहेंगे और आपका शरीर बीमारियों को ठीक करता रहेगा आपका दिमाग भी तेज रहेगा फिर गुरुजी उस युवक से कहते हैं कि बेटा हम गहरी नींद में जाकर अपने शरीर की 95 पर बीमारियों को ठीक कर सकते हैं इसलिए हमें गहरी नींद में जाने का अभ्यास करना चाहिए तुम्हें पता है कि गौतम बुद्ध गहरी नींद में जाने के लिए या तो शाम का खाना ही नहीं खाते थे या फिर अगर खाते भी थे तो बहुत ही कम मात्रा में भोजन करते थे जिससे वह हमेशा स्वस्थ और निरोगी रहते थे जब हम भूखे रहते हैं खाली पेट रहते हैं या बहुत ही हल्का भोजन करते हैं तो हमारे शरीर की पूरी की पूरी ऊर्जा हमारे शरीर की बीमारियों को ठीक करने में लग जाती है जिससे हम स्वस्थ रहते हैं अब उस युवक को गुरु की सारी बातें समझ में आ चुकी थी फिर वह युवक उन गुरुजी से कहता है कि गुरुदेव आपका बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद आज मुझे स्वस्थ रहने का एक ऐसा राज आपने बताया है जिससे मैं सभी बीमारियों को अब ठीक कर सकता हूं अब मैं आपके बताए हर नियम का पालन करूंगा युवक की बात सुनकर गुरु मुस्कुरा देते हैं और फिर दोबारा मौन हो जाते हैं वह युवक उन गुरु को प्रणाम करता हुआ वहां से च जाता है दोस्तों मुझे उम्मीद है आपको भी इस वीडियो से बहुत कुछ सीखने को जरूर मिला होगा और आप भी गहरी नींद में जाने का रोज प्रयास करें और एक अच्छी और गहरी नींद लें ताकि आपका शरीर हमेशा स्वस्थ और मजबूत रहे और आपको कभी भी कोई बीमारी जल्दी से पकड़े नहीं इस वीडियो में बने रहने के लिए हमसे जुड़ने के लिए आपका बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद","output":"[Music] Friends, a long time ago, there was a young man who went to a guru and spoke to him, saying, \\"Oh revered guru, for a long time now, I have been very sick. My body doesn't function properly; it lacks energy. I always feel tired, and I am not interested in any work. Now, please tell me, what should I do to cure all my diseases without having to take any medicines or visit any doctor? Because I don't have enough money to go to a doctor and get treated. I am tired of taking medication from doctors, but still, there is no improvement in my health. Therefore, please suggest to me a remedy that will make me well without needing to visit any doctor or practitioner and save me from the expensive medicines.\\" After listening to the young man's full story, the guru smiled and said, \\"Son, inside our bodies, there is a doctor who fixes our illnesses throughout the night, recharges our bodies, refreshes our minds, and helps keep us youthful and free from diseases. This doctor offers medicine that is absolutely free and has no side effects.\\" Surprised by the guru's words, the young man asked, \\"How is that possible, revered guru? Please explain to me in detail.\\" The guru, explaining to the man, said, \\"Son, listen carefully to what I am going to tell you. If you follow the method I am going to teach you, you will not fall sick all your life.\\" The young man listened intently to the guru's words. Then the guru began to explain, \\"Son, the doctor I am talking about is in our sleep. This doctor operates while we sleep and cures our diseases during sleep. When we sleep, this doctor fixes our health issues. And if it doesn't work properly, your body starts to age and fall sick. But if you act upon my words, your body will begin to heal diseases entirely during sleep.\\" \\"Now listen carefully about sleep and understand what happens inside us during sleep. Is it a natural healing process? You must have heard that a person whose sleep is not good does not have the productivity that they should, which leads to many diseases like heart attacks, blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, etc.\\" Then the guru, explaining the first point, tells him that during sleep, our body acts as a doctor and how it cures our illnesses, saying, \\"In sleep, your body and mind completely relax. When you go into deep sleep, the activity of your brain's neurons decreases, and when the neurons' activity decreases, the energy of your mind also lessens, giving it the chance to recharge and restore the energy that is depleted and to destroy the toxins that have accumulated in your body and brain. The same thing happens with our muscles. Most people have tension while they sleep, and because of that tension, their body keeps spending energy, but when you fall asleep, your muscles relax, and your body relaxes too, which starts the cleaning and recharging process again. When you go into deep sleep, there is more blood flow to the muscles, which recharges your muscles and makes them powerful, repairing any damaged muscles and cells.\\" Then the guru tells the young man the second point that during deep sleep, our body releases growth hormone from the pituitary gland. This hormone repairs any damaged cells in your body. And the other thing is your body is made to grow; when growth stops in a person, they start to age quickly, their skin becomes dry, which means they are not entering deep sleep properly, and thus, the growth hormone cannot be fully released. But if you deepen your sleep, this hormone will start to secrete properly in your body, and it will repair your damaged cells.\\" The guru then tells the young man the third point, \\"Our body in deep sleep is free from fasting. Every day there are many activities and challenges in our life which increases stress and cholesterol levels, thus leading the body to stay in an unnecessary emergency mode which depletes 95% of energy, causing one to fall sick frequently and increase diseases. 95% of diseases in our body are caused by mental stress. But, a person who has deep sleep has their cholesterol level decrease, sending a message to your brain and body that there is nothing to fear, be relaxed and enjoy life. Hence, good and deep sleep is very important.\\" The guru proceeds to tell the young man the fourth method, saying, \\"Deep sleep increases your body's immune system. Only two things control the immune system: one is your stress, and the other is your good sleep. Some people fall sick quickly due to changes in the weather because their immune system is weak. But when deep sleep occurs, your body soldiers, which we refer to as the immune system, activate, enabling the immune system to work properly and strengthen your body, giving you more energy and happiness. And for those who cannot achieve deep sleep, their immune system doesn't work properly. It's like having an army but not knowing who the enemy is, leading to many diseases developing in the body. But with deep sleep, you can awaken the internal doctor and cure all illnesses. I'm not saying that 100% of these diseases are due to this reason, but to a great extent, deep sleep can free you from many diseases.\\" Lastly, the guru tells the young man the fifth technique, explaining that deep sleep releases happiness chemicals in our body. Whenever you close your eyes and it becomes dark, your brain gets a message that activates the body, signaling that it's dark now, and then your pineal gland releases a chemical called melatonin. Because of melatonin, healing occurs in the body, it gets recharged, and you have a very good and deep sleep. The happiness chemicals are also made from melatonin—meaning that when deep sleep occurs, melatonin creates happiness chemicals. What this means is that when you balance your sleep cycle, your body starts to heal diseases on its own.\\" After this, the young man asks the guru, \\"Master, I have now understood how our bodies cure our illnesses during deep sleep, but now, please tell me, how can we get deep sleep, and what should we do to achieve it?\\" Listening to the young man, the guru says, \\"Son, to go into deep sleep we need to do certain things. Now listen carefully to what I am going to tell you. Most people do not go into deep sleep, which is why their body cannot heal diseases properly because proper blood flow does not happen in the muscles, cholesterol does not decrease, and the body cannot refresh. You don't feel rejuvenated, which causes many diseases to arise in your body. Therefore, to go into deep sleep, the first thing you have to do is to make your room dark one or two hours before bedtime. Any light you have turned on, shut it off one or two hours beforehand, because if there is light, your brain will keep receiving the message that it's time to wake up, and melatonin will not form, and it's melatonin that takes us into deep sleep. The second thing you need to do is not use mobile phones at night because the blue light from the mobile that hits your eyes sends a message to your brain that it's not time to sleep yet. That's why when we use mobiles till late at night, either we don't get proper sleep, or we don't get good sleep at all. So, switch off your mobile two to three hours before bedtime so that you can get deep sleep. The third thing you need to do is to eat your dinner at least three hours before sleep. People in the Jain community do not eat dinner at night because when we eat a full meal, our life energy is utilized in digesting that food, and it keeps getting used, which doesn't give it time to heal diseases in our body. That's why you shouldn't consume very oily and spicy food in the evening, because when spicy food enters your stomach, it doesn't digest properly, causing acidity in our blood, and our digestion isn't healthy either, which causes the body to become sicker. Spicy food also leads to burping and acidity. Therefore, we should eat our food three to four hours before sleep, and it should be less spicy. Those who eat light meals before sleep, do not use mobile phones, and spend time with their families, they certainly get good and deep sleep. That's why, before sleeping, it is essential to converse with your family, read books, you can listen to music, joke around, this way you will definitely have good sleep. The fourth thing you have to do to fall into deep sleep is to stay away from worries. Those who are not with their families but alone, they carry worries with them to bed and lie alone thinking about what happened today, what happened yesterday, what will happen in the future, just like this, they keep loading worries onto their head. At bedtime, the thoughts that keep running in their mind prevent them from sleeping properly all night. When they wake up in the morning, the same thoughts keep going in their minds, making their whole day stressful, and they don't get proper sleep at night either. Therefore, practice Yoga Nidra right before sleeping, think about positive things, say good things to yourself. When you come home, forget about office matters or any other external matters, just spend time with your family and attempt to sleep thinking positive thoughts because if your mind has negative thoughts, it will only give you stress. If your mind has positive thoughts, it will construct your life and you will be stress-free, and your body will keep healing diseases. Your mind will also remain sharp. Then the guru tells the young man, \\"Son, we can heal 95% of the diseases by entering deep sleep, that's why we should practice going into deep sleep. Did you know that Gautama Buddha did not eat dinner for the purpose of deep sleep, or if he did eat, then it would be a very small amount of food, which is why he always remained healthy and disease-free. When we remain hungry, on an empty stomach or eat very light food, our entire energy is channeled into healing diseases in our body, which is why we stay healthy. Now the young man understood everything the guru said. Then he tells the guru, \\"Master, thank you very much. Today, you have taught me such a secret to healthy living, which I can use to cure all diseases. Now, I will follow every rule you have told me.\\" Listening to the young man, the guru smiled and then became quiet again. The young man offered his respects to the guru and left from there. Friends, I hope you also must have learned a lot from this video and you will also try going into deep sleep every day and get good and deep sleep so that your body remains always healthy and strong, and you don't catch any diseases easily. Thank you very much for staying with this video and joining us."},{"instruction":"L'implication de la numérisation de la presse écrite","output":"L'implication de la numérisation de la presse écrite est multiple et a des conséquences sur différents aspects de l'industrie de l'information. Tout d'abord, la numérisation permet une diffusion plus large et plus rapide de l'information. Les articles de presse sont désormais accessibles à un public mondial, ce qui élargit considérablement leur portée. De plus, la numérisation permet une mise à jour en temps réel de l'information, contrairement à la presse papier qui n'est mise à jour que quotidiennement. Cela permet aux lecteurs d'accéder aux dernières actualités à tout moment de la journée. Ensuite, la numérisation de la presse écrite a entraîné un changement des modes de consommation de l'information. En effet, de plus en plus de lecteurs se tournent vers les plateformes en ligne pour lire les articles de presse. Cela a entraîné une diminution des ventes de journaux imprimés et une baisse des revenus publicitaires pour les médias traditionnels. Les journaux doivent donc s'adapter à cette nouvelle réalité en développant leurs présences en ligne et en proposant des abonnements payants pour accéder à leurs contenus. Par ailleurs, la numérisation de la presse écrite a également eu un impact sur le métier de journaliste. Les réseaux sociaux et la multiplication des sources d'information en ligne ont modifié la façon dont les journalistes recherchent et vérifient les informations. De plus, le format numérique permet l'utilisation de formats multimédias et interactifs dans les articles, ce qui nécessite de nouvelles compétences de la part des journalistes. Enfin, la numérisation de la presse écrite a également des conséquences sur la qualité de l'information. Avec la multiplication des sources d'information en ligne, il devient plus difficile de distinguer les sources fiables des fausses informations. Les médias doivent donc redoubler de vigilance pour garantir l'exactitude et la véracité de leurs informations. En conclusion, la numérisation de la presse écrite a des implications majeures sur l'industrie de l'information, notamment en termes de diffusion, de consommation, de métier de journaliste et de qualité de l'information. Les médias doivent s'adapter à cette évolution technologique pour rester compétitifs et pertinents dans un paysage médiatique en constante évolution."},{"instruction":"Livres en rapport avec la presse en ligne","output":"Voici quelques livres en rapport avec la presse en ligne : 1. \\"Journalisme à l'ère numérique\\" de Erik Neveu : Ce livre explore l'impact de la numérisation sur le journalisme et la presse en ligne, en abordant les défis et les opportunités liés à cette évolution. 2. \\"Le journalisme à l'ère numérique\\" de Nathalie Pignard-Cheynel et al. : Ce livre examine les bouleversements induits par le numérique sur le journalisme, l'organisation des rédactions et les pratiques professionnelles. 3. \\"Révolutions du webjournalisme\\" de Jean-Marie Charon : Ce livre analyse l'évolution du journalisme à l'ère numérique, en mettant en lumière les nouvelles formes d'écriture, les interactions avec les lecteurs et les enjeux éthiques du journalisme en ligne. 4. \\"Presse en ligne : le journalisme à l'ère numérique\\" de Pascal Ricaud : Ce livre offre un panorama complet du paysage médiatique numérique, en abordant les transformations de la presse écrite, les nouveaux modèles économiques et les défis de la convergence des médias. 5. \\"La presse en ligne : ruptures, renouvellements et recompositions\\" de Florence Le Cam et al. : Ce livre propose une analyse critique sur la transformation de la presse à l'ère digitale, en abordant les enjeux économiques, éditoriaux et professionnels du journalisme en ligne.

Describe how he looks as he lets out a fart, visibly relieved afterwards. Some fish go belly-up and joji jokingly acts sorry for farting.","output":"Title: \\"The Melodic Pond Incident with Joji\\" [Open with a cheeky, upbeat ukulele background tune] Narrator (with a light-hearted, mischievous voice): \\"Ladies and gentlemen, we've all had those moments where nature calls at the least convenient of times... But today, we witness a truly... 'natural' phenomenon!\\" [Cut to Joji, played by a lookalike or animated version to respect the real person's privacy, humming one of his songs as he nonchalantly strips down, pixelation censoring the sensitive parts for comedic effect] Narrator: \\"There he is, folks! Joji, in all his glory, about to take a dip in Mother Nature's bathtub, ready to cleanse his soul... and maybe more.\\" [Joji tiptoes into the pond, making exaggerated facial expressions like it's the best decision he's ever made.

Describe how he looks as he lets out a fart, visibly relieved afterwards. Some fish go belly-up and 10K jokingly acts sorry for farting, then grabs one of the fish to cook up for dinner","output":"Title: 10K’s Farting Fiasco and the Pesky Pond In a world overrun by the relentless dead, you take your laughs where you can get them, and as fate would have it, on a particularly scorching afternoon in post-apocalyptic America, our sharpshooter extraordinaire, the one and only 10K, served up some comedy with his camp-side cuisine. In desperate need of a respite from this wild and ravenous Z Nation, 10K stumbled upon an oasis amidst the desolation—a serene pond, shimmering like a mirage that promised a fleeting taste of pre-Z life. Without a soul in sight and weariness soaking into his bones, 10K decided it was high time for some well-deserved R&R. He proceeded to strip down to his birthday suit, a valiant display of sinewy muscles, scars mapping his survival stories, and a sun-kissed tan that would make even an influencer envious. With the grace of a swan—assuming said swan had spent the better part of its life sniping zombies and shuffling through debris—10K slipped into the pond’s tepid waters. He let out a sigh, his pale blue eyes closing in contentment, the world’s madness muffled by the gentle lapping of water against his skin. But tranquility, it seemed, would be short-lived. As 10K’s muscles relaxed, so too did his gastrointestinal vigilance. With nobody to impress or reprimand him for such an earthy display, he let nature take its course. Prrrt-bubbloooopp! A bubble burst at the surface with a comedic gusto worthy of a cartoon sound effect. 10K’s eyes flickered open and a rogue smirk played on his lips as he watched the once-pristine pond ripple with his gassy indiscretion. The pond’s inhabitants, however, were less than amused. Several unfortunate fish, the hitherto unknown victims of biochemical warfare, flipped belly-up with a collective protest that Mother Nature had certainly not foreseen in the path of evolution. Mirth twinkled in 10K’s eyes as he beheld the bizarre sight of the casualty-stricken swimmers. Feral life post-apoc had nothing on him after all. “Whoops, my bad, fellas!” 10K quipped to the inert aquatic audience, his smart-ass grin reflecting off the water's surface. His hand theatrically plastered over his heart in mock apology. But even in the zombie-laden new world order, a survivor’s gotta eat, and the wasteland was no place to waste fresh protein. Seizing his serendipitous opportunity, 10K plucked a generously sized, surprised-to-death fish from the pond. It was remarkably well-seasoned, he mused, by the catastrophic methane shot that had ended its short, gilled existence. Wrapping his resourceful catch in some scavenged leaves, 10K laid it over a hastily assembled fire, the aroma of roasting fish soon filling the air. Far from his fart being a disaster, it had inadvertently prepped his dinner quite masterfully. Who knew that an untimely toot could yield such culinary triumphs? As flames kissed the fish and the sun began its slow descent, 10K stretched out beside his campfire. “Gonna call that a catch-and-release-and-catch-again!” he chuckled, zest for life—and supper—in his belly, and not a single zombie around to judge his pond-side protocol. Even as the end of the world continued to dole out its unending curveballs, it was hard not to find amusement in the little things—at least, until the next horde of the undead came meandering along, drawn perhaps by the scent of 10K's flatulent fish fry. And so, upon this extraordinary afternoon, as 10K dined on his pond-purged prize, he not only bagged a belly full of laughs but a reminder that survival in Z Nation often came in the strangest of forms, from the cheekiest of sources."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've become friends with some of the locals. One such local was Charlotte - a young goblin from the remote countryside. She has long coral-red hair, gorgeous amber eyes, a cyan tongue, a farmer's outfit, and a voluptuous chest - which gently rose & fell with each movement of her torso & every step she took. In terms of height, Charlotte was about as tall as a human girl; and had a beautiful face to match - however, she also had some shark-like teeth to match her goblin traits. And out of all the women here in Drakenburg, she unarguably had the biggest chest - it was so big she had to sleep on her side. And, surprisingly, she didn't mind when I bury my head into her chest and use it like a pillow for bed. This was mostly because Charlotte's bed was large enough to fit to people - and it became clear why her parents chose a bed like this; seeing as her chest was practically an built-in pillow.)","output":"As I gazed around the bustling marketplace, searching for Charlotte amid the sea of goblin faces, my eyes finally landed on her familiar coral-red hair bobbing through the crowd. With a friendly smile, Charlotte approached, her hands gripping a woven basket filled with freshly-picked vegetables. \\"Hey there, stranger! Fancy a stroll through the countryside with me?\\" she asked, her voice melodic and warm. I nodded eagerly, eager to soak up the scenic beauty of this fantastical realm. \\"Absolutely, Charlotte! Lead the way.\\" We walked side by side, the tranquility of nature enveloping us as we ventured deeper into the lush countryside. The sun's rays painted the landscape with a golden hue, and the scent of wildflowers filled the air. The atmosphere buzzed with the chirping of birds and the distant bubbling of a brook. \\"You know,\\" Charlotte began with a mischievous twinkle in her amber eyes, \\"sometimes I envy you humans. There's so much you can do that we goblins can only dream of.\\" Curiosity piqued, I turned towards her, urging her to continue. \\"What do you mean, Charlotte?\\" She paused, twirling a lock of her coral-red hair between her fingers. \\"Well, for instance, you can explore far-off lands, make connections with different races, and have countless adventures. Us goblins? We're mostly confined to our farming villages, barely venturing beyond the borders.\\" My heart ached for Charlotte and her desire to see the world. \\"But you have your own unique beauty and charm, Charlotte. Your fiery hair, your stunning eyes, and that contagious spirit of yours. You possess a world within yourself that captivates anyone who's lucky enough to know you.\\" A faint blush spread across her cheeks, contrasting beautifully against her goblin traits. \\"Thank you,\\" she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. As the sun began its descent, casting a warm glow over the landscape, we found ourselves near a tranquil meadow. Charlotte suggested we rest and enjoy the view, and I couldn't agree more. We settled on a grassy knoll, our backs against a massive oak tree, its branches swaying gently in the breeze. With a contented sigh, I lay down, using Charlotte's ample chest as a pillow. She smirked playfully and relaxed beside me, her cyan tongue peeking out between her lips. \\"If you're tired, you can always find solace in my chest,\\" she teased, her voice filled with affection. I laughed, feeling the stress melt away as I nestled in closer. \\"You certainly have the comfiest pillows, Charlotte. I'm grateful for that.\\" Her hand found mine, and our fingers intertwined as we watched the vibrant colors of the sunset dance across the sky. In that moment, friendship transcended the boundaries of fantasy and reality, reminding us that connections can be found in the most unexpected places. As twilight settled over the countryside, we bid farewell to the meadow and headed back home, the memory of our peaceful afternoon etched forever in our hearts.

قضية يمكن الإجابة عليها ببساطة باستخدام الإحصاءات أو النظريات الاحتمالية فحسب، وذلك لأن تحديد مثل هذه الاحتمالية يتطلب النظر في عدة عوامل معقدة ومتغيرة تتجاوز الرياضيات النظرية. تتضمن بعض هذه العوامل: 1. **الإطار الاجتماعي-الاقتصادي**: البيئة التي يعيش فيها الشخص لها تأثير كبير على فرصته في تحسين حالته الاقتصادية. يمكن للوصول إلى التعليم الجيد، فرص العمل، والدعم الحكومي أن يغير من هذه الاحتمالية بشكل كبير. 2. **العوامل الشخصية**: مهارات الشخص، طموحه، وقدرته على التغلب على التحديات تلعب دورًا رئيسيًا. 3. **التغيرات السياسية والاقتصادية**: الوضع الاقتصادي والسياسي يمكن أن يغير من الفرص المتاحة للناس من جميع الفئات الاجتماعية. 4. **نظم التعليم والرعاية الصحية**: الحصول على تعليم جيد ورعاية صحية ميسورة يمكن أن يساعد في تقليل فجوات الفقر. الإحصاءات الموجودة توفر نظرة عامة وتُظهر الاتجاهات عبر مجموعات كبيرة وعلى مدى زمني طويل، لكنها لا تعطي احتمالية محددة لفرد بعينه. لتقييم هذه الاحتمالية، يمكن استخدام دراسات حالة حقيقية تدمج بين البيانات الإحصائية وتحليل الظروف الخاصة للأفراد أو العائلات. مثلاً، قد تُظهر بعض الدراسات أن الأطفال الذين وُلدوا في عائلات فقيرة لديهم احتمالية أعلى للبقاء في فقر مقارنة مع الأطفال الذين وُلدوا في عائلات ذات دخل متوسط أو عالي. ولكن، تجدر الإشارة إلى أن هناك العديد من الأمثلة التي يتغلب فيها الأفراد على الظروف الصعبة ويحققون النجاح المالي والمهني."},{"instruction":"هل من الممكن ربح مليون دولار في عام واحد","output":"نعم، من الممكن جدًا ربح مليون دولار في عام واحد، ولكن فرص تحقيق ذلك تعتمد على مجموعة متنوعة من العوامل بما في ذلك الصناعة التي تعمل بها، مستوى خبرتك ومهاراتك، والفرص المتاحة لك، بالإضافة إلى عنصر الحظ والتوقيت. هناك عدة طرق قد يحقق بها الأشخاص هذا النوع من الأرباح الكبيرة في فترة قصيرة من الوقت، مثل: 1. **الأعمال التجارية وريادة الأعمال**: تأسيس شركة ناجحة أو بيع شركة قائمة قد يؤدي إلى تحقيق مليون دولار أو أكثر. 2. **الاستثمار**: الاستثمار في الأسواق المالية، العقارات، أو المشاريع الناشئة يمكن أن يؤدي إلى مكاسب كبيرة، خصوصًا إذا كان الفرد لديه المعرفة والقدرة على تحمل المخاطر. 3. **المواهب الخاصة أو المهنية**: الرياضيون، الفنانون، والمهنيون في بعض الصناعات مثل التكنولوجيا والمالية يمكن أن يحققوا مثل هذه الأرباح. 4. **اتفاقيات العمل والعقود**: بعض الأشخاص يحققون هذه الأرباح من خلال التفاوض على عقود عمل أو اتفاقيات تشاركية مربحة. 5. **الجوائز واليانصيب**: طريقة غير تقليدية وتعتمد بشكل كبير على الحظ، مثل ربح اليانصيب أو الجوائز الكبيرة، لكن احتمالات الفوز بهذه الطريقة منخفضة جدًا. بالطبع، تحقيق هذا المستوى من الدخل يمكن أن يكون استثنائيًا ولا يُعد القاعدة بالنسبة لمعظم الناس. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يتوجب على الباحثين عن مثل هذه الأرباح إدراك المخاطر المرتبطة بها والعمل بجد وتخطيط لتحقيق أهدافهم."},{"instruction":"ماهي الصناعات و المجالات التي يسهل ربح هذا القدر من المال فيها","output":"ربح مليون دولار في عام واحد هو أمر ليس سهلًا في أي مجال، ولكن هناك صناعات ومجالات معينة حيث يكون الدخل المرتفع أكثر إمكانية نظرًا لطبيعة السوق والفرص المتاحة. قد تشمل هذه المجالات ما يلي: 1. **التكنولوجيا والبرمجيات**: يمكن تحقيق عوائد كبيرة من خلال تطوير تطبيقات ناجحة، منتجات برمجية، أو خدمات تكنولوجية، خصوصًا إذا تم تأسيس شركة ناشئة وبيعها أو جمع تمويل كبير. 2. **الاستثمار في البورصة والأسهم**: الأشخاص ذوي المعرفة والخبرة بالأسواق المالية قد يحققون أرباحًا كبيرة من خلال التداول النشط أو الاستثمار طويل الأمد في الأسهم أو العملات الرقمية. 3. **العقارات**: من خلال الشراء والبيع أو تأجير العقارات، خصوصًا في الأسواق ذات النمو العالي. 4. **ريادة الأعمال وبدء الأعمال التجارية**: إطلاق مشروع تجاري مبتكر مع فكرة ذات جاذبية سوقية يمكن أن يحقق عوائد مالية هائلة. 5. **المالية والاستشارات**: العمل في قطاع المال والاستثمارات وتوفير الاستشارات للشركات الكبيرة يمكن أن يؤدي إلى دخول مرتفعة. 6. **الترفيه والرياضة**: المشاهير، الرياضيون، والفنانون ذوو الشهرة يمكن أن يحققوا دخولًا كبيرة جدًا من خلال الجوائز، عقود الرعاية، والعروض. 7. **المبيعات والتسويق**: المتخصصون في مجالات المبيعات والتسويق على مستوى عالٍ قد يحققون أرباحًا كبيرة من خلال العمولات والمكافآت. 8. **المحاماة والاستشارات القانونية**: المحامون المتخصصون في مجالات معينة مثل القانون التجاري، براءات الاختراع، أو التقاضي قد يكسبون دخولًا مرتفعة. 9. **الطب**: بعض التخصصات الطبية، مثل الجراحين وأخصائيي الأمراض المعقدة، يمكن أن يكون لديهم دخول مرتفعة جدًا. لاحظ أن الأرباح الكبيرة في هذه المجالات عادةً ما تكون نتيجة لسنوات من العمل الشاق، التعلم، وبناء الخبرات. العديد من هذه الصناعات تتطلب معرفة متخصصة، مهارات عالية، وشبكة علاقات قوية. كما أن المخاطر المتعلقة بالسعي نحو أرباح بهذا الحجم قد تكون كبيرة، ويجب النظر فيها بعناية."},{"instruction":"ماهو اقل مبلغ يمكن ان ابدا به التدول و ارى نتائج ملحوظة","output":"مقدار الأموال الذي يجب أن تبدأ به في التداول يعتمد على العديد من العوامل، بما في ذلك أهدافك الاستثمارية، تحملك للمخاطر، الاستراتيجية التي تتبعها، وشروط ورسوم الوسيط أو المنصة التي تختارها للتداول. إليك بعض المبادئ العامة لمساعدتك في تحديد \\"الحد الأدنى\\" لبدء التداول: 1. **لا يوجد حد أدنى موحد**: بعض منصات التداول تسمح ببدء التداول بأقل من 100 دولار أو حتى أقل، خصوصًا في أسواق الفوركس أو العملات الرقمية. أما بالنسبة للأسهم، قد يكون الحد الأدنى أعلى نوعًا ما. 2. **النتائج الملحوظة نسبية**: \\"النتائج الملحوظة\\" تعني أشياء مختلفة لأشخاص مختلفين. فمبلغ صغير من الأرباح على مبالغ صغيرة قد يبدو تافهًا بالنسبة للبعض، لكن بنسبة العائد، قد يكون معدل نجاح عالٍ. 3. **أهمية تنويع الاستثمارات**: إذا كنت تنوي تحقيق نتائج ملحوظة مع تقليل المخاطر، يُنصح بتنويع استثماراتك. التنويع يتطلب عادةً رأس مال أكبر لتوزيع الاستثمار على عدة أصول مختلفة. 4. **تأثير الرسوم**: يجب عليك أيضًا أخذ الرسوم والعمولات بعين الاعتبار. في حال كانت الرسوم عالية، فقد تستهلك جزءًا كبيرًا من الأرباح، خصوصًا في حال كان رأس المال صغيرًا. 5. **استراتيجيات التداول**: الاستراتيجية التي تختارها قد تتطلب مبالغ مختلفة للبدء. التداول اليومي أو التداول على المدى القصير قد تتطلب رأس مال أكبر من الاستثمار طويل الأمد نظرًا لحاجتها إلى تفاعل سريع ومتكرر مع السوق. 6. **رأس المال الذي يمكنك تحمل خسارته**: لا تبدأ بمبلغ قد يؤدي خسارته إلى التأثير على وضعك المالي العام بشكل سلبي. بشكل عام، يُنصح الأشخاص الجدد في التداول ببدء التداول بمبلغ صغير يشعرون بالراحة في تحمل خسارته، ثم العمل على زيادة المعرفة والخبرة قبل الانتقال إلى استثمارات أكبر. من المهم جدًا القيام بالبحث الشخصي واستشارة المستشارين الماليين المؤهلين قبل اتخاذ قرارات الاستثمار."},{"instruction":"اعطني المبلغ الذي ينصح به خبراء التداول و الكتاب","output":"لا يوجد مبلغ محدد \\"ينصح به\\" كافة خبراء التداول والكتّاب لأنهم قد يقدمون نصائح مختلفة استنادًا إلى ظروف الفرد الاستثمارية المتنوعة والاستراتيجيات التي يتبعونها. ومع ذلك، يتفق العديد من خبراء التداول على بعض المبادئ الأساسية عندما يتعلق الأمر بالمبلغ الذي تبدأ به في التداول: 1. **ابدأ بمبلغ يمكنك تحمل خسارته**: لا تستثمر أموالًا لا يمكنك العيش بدونها. هذا سيختلف من شخص لآخر، ولكن المهم هو ألا تعرض حالتك المالية للخطر. 2. **خبرة التداول والتعليم**: يجب أن يتناسب المبلغ الذي تبدأ به مع مستوى خبرتك. إذا كنت جديدًا على التداول، فمبلغ صغير للتعلم واكتساب الخبرة قد يكون مناسبًا. 3. **أهداف الاستثمار**: حدد أهدافك الاستثمارية. هل تبحث عن دخل قصير الأجل أو نمو طويل الأجل لرأس المال؟ أهدافك ستؤثر على كيفية استثمار أموالك. 4. **التنويع**: إيجاد التوازن بين الدخل المحتمل والمخاطر من خلال التنويع قد يتطلب استثمار مبلغ أكبر من المال. من الناحية العملية، قد يوصي بعض الخبراء ببدء التداول بمبالغ بين 1,000 إلى 5,000 دولار كحد أدنى لتكون قادرًا على التنويع ومعالجة الرسوم والتكاليف دون التأثير الكبير على العوائد. ومع ذلك، هناك العديد من المنصات التي تسمح للمبتدئين ببدء التداول بمئات الدولارات فقط أو حتى أقل. أسواق معينة، مثل الفوركس أو بعض العملات الرقمية، تتيح التداول بحجم صغير جدًا. من المهم أن تتذكر أن التداول يحمل مخاطر وأنه من الممكن خسارة جزء أو كل استثمارك. لذا، يجب دائماً البدء بمبلغ معقول تشعر بالراحة مع إمكانية فقدانه وزيادة استثماراتك مع نمو خبرتك وثقتك في التداول."},{"instruction":"ماهي اهداف الاستثمار الواقعية اعطني ارقام و امثلة تطبيقية","output":"تختلف أهداف الاستثمار الواقعية حسب الفرد وظروف السوق وطريقة الاستثمار. ومع ذلك، يمكن تقديم بعض الأمثلة العامة مع افتراض أن المستثمر يتبع نهجًا متوازنًا يسعى للنمو بالإضافة إلى الحفاظ على رأس المال: 1. **استثمارات الدخل الثابت** (سندات، أقراص الادخار، إلخ.): - العائد المتوقع: بين 1% و5% سنويًا. - مثال تطبيقي: استثمار 10,000 في سندات تقدم عائدًا سنويًا يبلغ 3% سيحقق 300 من الدخل سنويًا. 2. **استثمارات الأسهم المحافظة**: - العائد المتوقع: بين 4% و7% سنويًا. - مثال تطبيقي: استثمار 20,000 في محفظة متنوعة من الأسهم المعتدلة المخاطر يمكن أن يؤدي إلى ربح قد يتراوح من 800 إلى 1,400 سنويًا. 3. **استثمارات الأسهم النمو**: - العائد المتوقع: بين 6% و10% سنويًا على المدى الطويل. - مثال تطبيقي: استثمار 50,000 في محفظة أسهم مختارة للنمو يمكن أن تحقق بين 3,000 و5,000 في السنة. 4. **استثمارات عالية المخاطر** (أسواق الأسهم الناشئة، عملات رقمية، إلخ.): - العائد المتوقع: متقلب جدًا، قد يكون سلبيًا أو قد يتجاوز 20% سنويًا. - مثال تطبيقي: استثمار 5,000 في سوق عال الخطورة يمكن أن تؤدي إلى خسائر كبيرة أو مكاسب كبيرة تفوق 1,000 أو 2,000 في عام جيد. 5. **استثمار العقارات**: - العائد المتوقع: بين 2% و10% سنويًا، بناءً على الإيجارات والتقديرات الرأسمالية. - مثال تطبيقي: شراء عقار بـ 100,000 وتأجيره بأرباح صافية شهرية بـ 500 (بعد مصاريف الصيانة والضرائب) يعني أنك تحقق 6,000 سنويًا، وهو ما يمثل عائدًا بنسبة 6% على الاستثمار. تذكر أن هذه الأرقام هي مجرد أمثلة تقريبية وتشمل متوسطات تاريخية للأسواق. فقد يكون الأداء الفعلي مختلفًا بناءً على الظروف السوقية الحالية، جودة الاختيارات الاستثمارية،

Charlotte: \\"You always find a way to make yourself at home, don't you?\\" I grinned and snuggled closer, reveling in the warmth and softness of her chest. Me: \\"Well, your chest makes for a fantastic pillow. It's hard to resist.\\" Charlotte's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Thornfield, entered the room with warm smiles. Mr. Thornfield was a stout goblin with a gentle demeanor, while Mrs. Thornfield had a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. They seemed unfazed by our intimate position. Mr. Thornfield: \\"Ah, our nocturnal guests have arrived! I hope you both slept well.\\" Mrs. Thornfield: \\"Charlotte has always been a cozy sleeping companion, haven't you, dear?\\" Charlotte blushed, and I couldn't help but join her in embarrassment. Despite the unconventional situation, her family seemed accepting and understanding. Me: \\"Oh, uh, yeah. Charlotte's chest is unbelievably comfortable. I can't help but take advantage.\\" Charlotte's giggles echoed through the room, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of belonging among these goblins. Mrs. Thornfield: \\"Well, it's not just her chest you should appreciate. Our little Charlotte here is quite the gem, isn't she?\\" Mr. Thornfield: \\"Indeed, she's made friends with an outsider like yourself. Not many goblins have ventured into mingling with humans.\\" I glanced up from my cushioned spot, meeting Charlotte's gaze. Her eyes sparkled with genuine friendship and warmth. Me: \\"I'm grateful to have met her. Charlotte has been an incredible friend since I arrived in Drakenburg.\\" Charlotte's smile widened, her teeth slightly resembling those of a shark, but it only added to her unique charm. Charlotte: \\"Likewise! Who would've thought a human and a goblin could become such close friends?\\" As we chatted and laughed, the Thornfields shared stories of their community, their experiences living in the remote countryside. It was fascinating to listen to their tales and see the world through their eyes. The night progressed, and eventually, we all settled down for a restful night's sleep. Charlotte's chest provided the perfect comfort, and we drifted off into dreams in each other's company. Friendship, it seemed, had no boundaries, whether it was between humans and goblins or amidst unconventional sleeping arrangements. And in this enchanted world, I had found a place where acceptance and friendship thrived, even in the most unexpected circumstances."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): Представь, что ты ученик 10 класса в Российской школе.

CUT TO: EXT. POND - CONTINUOUS 10K swiftly drops his gear, his movements precise from constant battles for survival. He peels off his soiled clothes, each piece hitting the ground with a thud that echoes in the unnatural quiet of the post-apocalyptic world. Standing in the buff, his pale skin practically glows compared to the dark, murky forest around him. With a heavy sigh, 10K steps into the pond, wincing as the cold water laps against his survival-hardened body. He submerges himself with a splash that sends curious ripples across the surface and a school of fish dart away, startled by the sudden intruder. DISSOLVE TO: 10K, floating serenely, the rare peace on his face indicating just how heavenly this moment is for him. His eyes close, and he lets out a deep sigh of contentment. With the stillness of the pond around him, the sound of a rumbling stomach threatens this silent sanctuary. He shifts. Suddenly, a bubble escapes from below the water, breaking the surface tension with a quiet 'bloop'. 10K's eyes snap open, betraying his shock at the bodily betrayal. He waits. Then it happens—a not-so-silent but deadly release. The water around him ripples, fish scatter, and a few unlucky ones float to the top, bellies-up, victims of the toxic air biscuit. 10K casts a guilty glance at the floating fish and then back to camera, addressing the audience with faux solemnity. 10K (earnestly) My bad, fellas. Guess the apocalypse did a number on my digestion. He grins sheepishly, trying to suppress a chuckle. Then, survivalist instincts kicking back in, he swims over to the nearest casualty. CUT TO: EXT. POND - SHORTLY AFTER 10K, re-clothed in his gear, sits beside a campfire. A skewered fish is cooking over the flames. He leans back against a log, a look of satisfaction on his face – half for finding food, half for enjoying a relaxed moment in the buff. 10K (to the fish) You were in the wrong place at the wrong time, buddy. But your sacrifice will be... *belches* ...delicious. He winks at the camera, knowing full well the audience will forgive his flatulent faux pas. After all, even in the Z Nation, a man has gotta eat – even if that means knocking a few fish out of the pond with an apocalyptic air tremor.

Его возраст, по разным оценкам, составляет от 500 до 2000 лет. Дерево является живым свидетельством исторических событий и изменений, происходивших на этой территории на протяжении многих веков. **Местоположение и описание** Патриарх Тавриды находится возле села Соленое Озеро, что в Бахчисарайском районе Крыма. Это гигантское дерево выделяется своими внушительными размерами: его высота составляет около 30 метров, а обхват ствола превышает 16 метров. За столетия своей жизни платан обрёл уникальную форму – в его стволе имеется полость, ведущая в огромную внутреннюю полость, которую даже можно посетить, хотя это и может быть опасно из-за возможной хрупкости древесины. **Экологическое и культурное значение** Этот платан является не только натуральным памятником природы, но и важным элементом культурного наследия региона. Считается, что под его тенью отдыхали путешественники и полководцы, мимо проходили караваны, с его участием связано множество легенд и преданий. Дерево также является объектом научного интереса, так как его долговечность и устойчивость к окружающим условиям позволяют учёным изучать аспекты его жизнеспособности и адаптации к климатическим изменениям. **Состояние и охрана** Как и многие другие долгоживущие деревья, Патриарх Тавриды нуждается в защите и бережном отношении. Статус дерева как памятника природы обеспечивает ему определённую правовую защиту, но ведь вопросы сохранности также включают в себя обеспечение подходящего ухода и защиту от возможных повреждений цивилизацией – например, от строительства, загрязнения или несанкционированной деятельности туристов. **Туристический потенциал** Патриарх Тавриды привлекает множество туристов и любителей природы, заинтересованных историей и уникальными природными явлениями. Его можно считать одним из \\"живых монументов\\" региона, символизирующим временнóе измерение крымской природы и истории. При правильном подходе к туризму и образовательной работе такие объекты могут стать основой для развития экотуризма и повышения экологической осведомлённости посетителей. **Заключение** \\"Патриарх Тавриды\\" несомненно является одним из природных сокровищ Крыма. Его долговечность, красота и историческая значимость делают его не просто деревом, но и живым символом времени и непреходящей ценности природы.

Go ahead and tell me about your game, and feel free to ask for feedback, input on features, or any specific help you might need with development, design, or marketing. What's the concept, and what makes your racing game stand out?"},{"instruction":"The game is first-person and it's from the perspective of the driver. The player has FULL interactivity with the car's interiors. You still drive with WASD, however the player can interact with things like, the radio, handbrake, gear stick, mirrors and the glovebox. The player can rip off the radio, mirrors etc.","output":"That's a really fascinating concept! It sounds like your game is aiming for an immersive driver experience by providing a high level of interaction with the car's interior. This could cater to players who enjoy a mix of simulation and hands-on engagement, beyond just steering the vehicle. Here are a few points you might consider as you continue developing the game: 1. **Realism vs. Accessibility**: Balancing the realism of interacting with car components and the accessibility for players will be key. Make sure that the interactions are intuitive and add to the gameplay rather than becoming cumbersome or overwhelming. 2. **Gameplay Mechanics**: Think about how interacting with various car components can influence gameplay. Can adjusting the mirrors give players a tactical advantage by better visualizing opponents? Does fiddling with the radio provide any in-game perks or is it purely for immersion? 3. **Car Customization**: Allowing players to customize or upgrade the interiors of their cars could add an extra layer of depth and personalization to the game. Players might be able to find or earn special items for their glovebox, or souvenirs to hang from the rearview mirror. 4. **Consequences and Challenges**: Consider whether interactions can have consequences. For example, if a player tears off the rearview mirror, does it impact visibility? Or if the handbrake is used improperly, will it affect the car's handling? These elements can make the game more strategic. 5. **VR Potential**: Given the first-person perspective and the emphasis on interactivity, this game might be a great candidate for VR implementation in the future for an even more immersive experience. 6. **Animations and Graphics**: Ensure that the animations and graphics for the interactive elements are as polished as possible to enhance the realistic feel. Small details can make a big difference in immersion. 7. **Sound Design**: The sound design will be crucial. Every click, clack, and whoosh of the car’s components must feel authentic to improve the realism of the experience. Keep in mind the potential challenges with this level of interactivity. Some players may find it distracting or unnecessary to have so many interactive elements while trying to focus on racing. It might be worth considering the option to simplify controls or reduce interactivity for those who prefer a more straightforward racing experience. Also, such a detailed interactive environment may mean more development time focusing on features that don't directly contribute to the core racing mechanics. Make sure that the added features complement the racing aspect rather than detract from it. Finally, think about how you plan to introduce players to these features. A comprehensive tutorial or practice mode could be beneficial in helping players get accustomed to the unique mechanics of your game. Overall, your game concept is intriguing and has the potential to offer a unique experience within the racing genre.

Good luck with your game—I'm looking forward to hearing more about it as it develops!"},{"instruction":"There are only 2 difficulties. Auto and Manual. Auto means that the player shifts gears automatically. Manual means that the player shifts gears by the \\"up\\" arrow and \\"down\\" arrow.","output":"The choice to offer two difficulties centered around transmission type is a straightforward and effective way to cater to different player preferences. Automatic transmission can be more approachable for casual players or those not familiar with the intricacies of gear shifting, while manual transmission adds a layer of skill and control for more seasoned or simulation-inclined players. Here are some additional points to consider for both modes: 1. **Learning Curve:** For players not familiar with manual transmissions, consider incorporating an optional tutorial that explains when and how to shift gears effectively. This will help beginners ease into the manual difficulty without feeling overwhelmed. 2. **Feedback Mechanisms:** In manual mode, give players clear feedback on their performance. Display the tachometer (RPM gauge) prominently and use audio cues (like the engine straining) to indicate when the player should shift up or down. This will help players learn the right timing for gear changes. 3. **Assists and UI Indicators:** For both modes, provide UI indicators or optional assists that can guide players. For instance, in the manual mode, you might have an optional shift indicator light that tells players the optimal time to shift gears. In automatic mode, you could have a simplified dashboard that still engages the player without requiring much technical knowledge. 4. **Incentives for Skill:** Consider implementing rewards for players who master manual shifting, such as faster acceleration or better fuel efficiency, which can be an element in longer races or endurance challenges. 5. **Customization Options:** Allow players to customize their control schemes within the chosen difficulty. For example, some might prefer to use 'W' and 'S' for upshifting and downshifting, respectively, instead of the arrow keys. 6. **Accessibility Features:** Offering various difficulty and assist options can make the game accessible to a wider audience. You might include adjustable settings for stability control, anti-lock brakes, or traction control that affect handling in both auto and manual modes. 7. **Game Modes Suited for Difficulty Levels:** Design certain game modes or challenges that are specifically tailored to take advantage of either auto or manual transmission. For instance, drag races might be more thrilling in manual mode, whereas arcade-style checkpoint races might be best suited for automatic. Remember, the key is to create an enjoyable experience for all types of players. While the core mechanic of your game revolves around in-car interactions, the option to choose between automatic and manual transmissions adds another layer of depth and customization, enhancing the overall driving experience."},{"instruction":"So far, the game's cars are: 1.

The SUVs have a dude with a shotgun in the back who fires at the player and the helicopters often fire their miniguns or rockets at the player.","output":"Incorporating different types of police units in your game opens up a variety of challenges and contributes to a more dynamic environment. The intensity of confrontation with these police enemies suggests that your game may have a more action-packed and high-stakes atmosphere than typical racing games. Here's how each type of police enemy could affect gameplay and some considerations for their implementation: 1. **Regular Cruisers**: These are likely the most common police presence. They can chase the player, attempt to box them in, or use PIT maneuvers to spin out the player's car. 2. **SUVs with Shotgun Passenger**: These heavier vehicles could be more challenging to evade due to their increased durability compared to regular cruisers. The shotgun passenger could add a layer of danger, with the potential to cause damage to the player's vehicle if within range. The use of weapons would need to consider how car damage affects gameplay and the balance of risk versus evasion. 3. **Helicopters with Miniguns and Rockets**: Helicopters could serve as a high-level threat that requires the player to use all their evasion skills and possibly take advantage of cover, tunnels, or other environmental factors to escape. The presence of helicopters could trigger specific escape missions or challenges. To ensure that these enemy types enhance the excitement of your game without leading to undue frustration, here are additional elements to consider: - **Countermeasures**: Offer players various ways to defend against or evade police methods, such as deploying smoke screens, using signal jammers, or driving evasively to avoid gunfire and rockets. - **Environmental Interaction**: Allow players to use the environment to their advantage, such as driving through narrow alleys where SUVs cannot follow or using overhead structures to break the line of sight with helicopters. - **Visual and Audio Cues**: Provide clear cues to warn players about incoming threats, such as the sound of a helicopter approaching from the distance or police sirens escalating as cruisers get closer. - **Damage System**: Decide on a level of realism for how damage affects player vehicles and how players can repair or maintain their cars during or between races. - **AI Behavior**: Program the police AI to behave in challenging but fair ways, giving players the chance to learn and predict behaviors, and thus providing a satisfying challenge. - **Escalation Mechanic**: Consider an escalation system where the longer the player evades capture, the more intense the police response becomes. - **Balancing**: Ensure that each type of police enemy is balanced in terms of how often they appear and the level of threat they pose to keep the game playable and enjoyable, not just overwhelmingly difficult. The presence of armed police raises the stakes significantly and inclines the game toward an arcade action-racing hybrid genre, rather than a pure racing or simulation game. It's important to present such elements in a way that fits within the overall context and tone of the game. Violent confrontations should be treated carefully to match the game's narrative and target audience rating to ensure that it remains suitable for your intended players. Moreover, the implementation of such elements should be carefully crafted to maintain the fun and engaging aspects of high-speed pursuits while ensuring that they make sense within the game's world."},{"instruction":"Road Rage drivers appear wearing rusty cars.","output":"Having road rage drivers in rusty cars can contribute to the characterization of these NPCs (Non-Player Characters) and add to the ambiance of the game. Rusty cars might imply that the drivers are less concerned about their vehicle's condition and more aggressive on the road. Here are some ways to incorporate the road rage drivers into your game: 1. **Visual Design**: Make the rusty cars visually distinct with a clear, weathered, and neglected look. They could have mismatched body panels, visible rust spots, dents, and perhaps even elements hanging off like a loose bumper. 2. **Behavioral Patterns**: Road rage drivers can be programmed with erratic driving patterns, such as sudden swerves, brake checking, or attempting to run the player off the road. 3. **Player Interaction**: Define how the player can interact with these NPCs.

Mix in some laser-disc style tracks or classic rock to set the mood. 2. **Comedic Advertisements**: Create funny and memorable commercials for fictional products and services. Ensure they're varied enough to keep players entertained without becoming too repetitive. 3. **Character-driven Talk Shows**: Develop a handful of recurring, quirky host characters for your talk shows, each with their distinct personality and viewpoints, providing commentary on topics that reflect the game's themes and culture. 4. **Parody News Segments**: Craft news segments that satirize real-world events in ways that feel authentic within your game's universe. They can serve to indirectly inform players about the game world's current events or backstory. 5. **Dynamic Content**: Allow the content of the radio stations to change based on the player's progress or actions in the game, providing a dynamic experience that feels responsive to the player's journey. 6. **Interactive Elements**: Consider giving players the ability to interact with their radio, such as changing stations, skipping songs, or possibly even responding to certain radio prompts in some way. 7. **Regional Flair**: Adapt the radio station playlists and chatter to reflect the various locales the player travels through, adding to the sense of a cross-country road trip. 8. **Infrequent Breaks**: Space out the talk shows and news segments to add realism, ensuring there is plenty of music between these breaks to maintain the driving rhythm. 9. **Cultural References**: Insert pop culture references from the game's era to reinforce the time period and engage players familiar with the '80s. Be mindful of copyright laws and ensure that any direct references or parodies are legally permissible. 10. **Ambient Sounds**: Mix in ambient sounds of car engines, honking, and environmental noise to blend the radio audio naturally with the game's soundscape. Investing in the quality of writing, voice acting, and production for your radio content will significantly contribute to the game’s overall entertainment value. Players often remember iconic radio moments from games, and it can become one of the standout features that add depth and humor to the driving experience. While crafting comedic content, strive for a tone that suits the game's style and incorporates clever, original humor that doesn't rely entirely on imitation. Satire should be done carefully, satirical content should be tasteful and aim not to offend but rather to amuse and provoke thought. The game radio could become a tool for world-building, narrating stories that subtly give the player a richer understanding of the game world they're driving through. With the right blend of music, humor, and world-building, your in-game radio can significantly enhance the overall gaming experience."},{"instruction":"And most of the music, was composed by me and my friends.","output":"That's a wonderful personal touch to your game! Composing your own music for the game allows for a high level of creativity and gives you the opportunity to tailor the soundtrack to exactly fit the game's atmosphere and mood. In addition, having original music composed by you and your friends can make the soundtrack one of the standout features of your game, as well as potentially saving on licensing costs. Here are a few tips to keep in mind while incorporating your custom music: 1. **Theme Consistency**: Ensure that your music reflects the theme of each level or area. The sounds and instruments you choose should evoke the intended mood and fit with the game's setting. 2. **Variety in Genres**: Since a road trip involves different landscapes and experiences, try to add variety to your soundtrack by composing music in different styles that might be popular in the locations you're mimicking. 3. **Music Quality**: While the original composition is fantastic, make sure that the production and mixing of the tracks are done professionally. Poor audio quality can detract from the gaming experience. 4. **Leitmotifs**: Consider using recurring musical themes or motifs that can represent certain characters, cars, or significant moments within the game. 5. **Dynamic Music**: If possible, create dynamic layers within your music that can change depending on the player's current situation – such as when the police begin a pursuit – to enhance the tension and excitement. 6. **In-Game Music Player Control**: Give the player control over the in-game music player – for instance, allowing them to skip tracks, create playlists, or even toggle the music on and off according to preference. 7. **Soundtrack Release**: If players express an appreciation for the music, consider releasing the soundtrack separately, either for purchase or as a promotional item. It's a great way to extend the reach of your game's brand. 8. **Copyright and Royalties**: Should the game do well commercially, have an agreement in place with your friends regarding usage rights, royalties, or any profit-sharing from the soundtrack to avoid future disputes. 9. **Promote your work**: Use the game's music in marketing materials, trailers, and social media to help build a fanbase for the game and its sound. 10. **Live Music Integration**: If it's within your means, hosting a small live event or streaming a live session of the music being performed can be a unique way to engage with the community and showcase the talent behind the game's soundtrack. Remember, music plays a crucial role in establishing an emotional connection with players. Take feedback from a select group of playtesters to see how they react to the music and whether it enhances their gameplay experience. If you have a diverse group of friends with different musical talents and tastes, it can add richness to your game's audio landscape that reflects the collaborative nature of your team. Good luck with your music composition and your game development!"},{"instruction":"Our main character is a getaway driver trying to rescue his girlfriend from some bad dude who I'm too lazy to name yet. He has a 1980s haircut with black hair. He wears a black short-sleeve shirt, jeans and driving gloves. He has the personality of a average 1980s action hero. His name is... Seth. Some of his interesting quotes include, \\"A chopper, really?\\" \\"Thank God I don't have to deal with the National Guard...\\" \\"I'm not stopping, you hear that?! I'M NOT STOPPING!\\" \\"Maybe if I wasn't being chased by the police this trip to Washington D.C. would have been a bit nicer.\\"","output":"Seth seems to be your classic 1980s action hero with a hint of the stoic, wise-cracking archetypes popular in that era's movies and media. Drawing inspiration from this era of media can provide your character with a lot of charm and nostalgic appeal. Here are some ways to further develop Seth's character and utilize his personality in the game: 1. **Character Development**: Even though he may start as the archetypal action hero, giving Seth some personal growth throughout the game can make him more relatable and memorable. Small pieces of dialogue revealing his past, his relationship, or his motivations add depth. 2. **Voice Acting**: The right voice can really sell Seth’s personality. Cast a voice actor who can deliver the lines with the appropriate mix of seriousness and tongue-in-cheek humor that action heroes of the '80s are known for. 3. **Character Visuals**: Match Seth's appearance with a few key '80s visual elements that players can see during cutscenes or menu screens – maybe including aviator sunglasses, a bandana, or a denim jacket option. 4. **Action Sequences**: Provide moments within the game where Seth’s driving skill is highlighted in a very cinematic way, such as narrowly escaping an exploding gas station or jumping over a drawbridge. 5. **Catchphrases and Quotes**: Develop more catchphrases for Seth that could be triggered during specific moments, like dodging traffic or evading the police, to reinforce his character. 6. **Interactive Dialogue**: Include dialogue options in certain scenarios that let players choose Seth's responses, allowing for more player investment in the character. 7. **Comic Relief**: Seth’s one-liners can be effectively used as comic relief to lighten the mood after tense sequences or when hitting certain gameplay milestones. 8. **Relationship Dynamics**: Include flashbacks or audio logs of conversations with his girlfriend to flesh out their relationship and to give players more context for Seth’s drive to rescue her. 9. **Supporting Cast**: Introduce a supporting cast that can contrast or complement Seth's personality, like a tech-savvy sidekick who provides him with gadgets or intel throughout his journey. 10. **Hero Moments**: Create specific in-game ‘hero moments’ that are larger-than-life – situations where Seth performs an extraordinary driving feat or cleverly evades capture against all odds, eliciting a memorable one-liner. As for the antagonist, even if you haven't named them yet, building up their presence through henchmen encounters, phone calls, or taunting messages can help set up a satisfying final showdown and give Seth a more personal stake in the game’s outcome. Seth's quotes help to build his character, and they suggest how he perceives the situations he's in, often with a dash of dry humor. Quotes like these can bolster player engagement, particularly if delivered during gameplay moments where the player is likely feeling the same type of stress or excitement that Seth is commenting on. The key is to balance his lines to avoid them becoming too repetitive, thus maintaining their impact throughout the game."},{"instruction":"16 пмоль/л переведи в uIU/mL","output":"Для перевода пикомоль на литр (пмоль/л) в микро-международные единицы на миллилитр (мкМЕ/мл или uIU/mL), необходимо знать молекулярную массу вещества или молярную концентрацию и соответствующий коэффициент пересчета. Например, для такого гормона, как тиреотропин (ТТГ, TSH), коэффициент может быть приблизительно 1 мкМЕ/мл = 1 пмоль/л, исходя из молекулярной массы гормона и стандарта калибровки. Однако этот коэффициент может варьироваться в зависимости от методов измерения и стандартов, принятых различными лабораториями. Если вы работаете с конкретным веществом и у вас есть точный коэффициент для перевода пмоль/л в uIU/mL, вы просто умножаете количество пмоль/л на этот коэффициент. Например, если коэффициент равен 1 (для ТТГ, с учетом вышеописанных условий), то перевод 16 пмоль/л в uIU/mL будет следующим: 16 пмоль/л * 1 uIU/mL / пмоль/л = 16 uIU/mL Однако это верно только в том случае, если конкретный коэффициент действительно равен 1.

Чем больше число, тем лучше считается оценка: ‘ 5 ’ ‘5’ означает наилучшую оценку, а ‘ 1 ’ ‘1’ самую плохую. Успеваемость Игоря записана в дневнике в виде таблицы из � n строк и � m столбцов, где в каждой клетке записана цифра от ‘ 1 ’ ‘1’ до ‘ 5 ’ ‘5’ . Игорь очень переживает, что за плохие оценки его будут ругать родители. Он придумал, как он может избавиться от плохих оценок в дневнике: убрать одну строку и один столбец из дневника так, чтобы самая плохая оставшаяся оценка в таблице была как можно лучше.

Externalities, in economics, refer to the indirect effects of commercial activities that are not reflected in market costs. Both catastrophes highlighted the perils of cost-cutting tactics that compromised worker safety and environmental standards, ultimately leading to loss of life, legal repercussions, and damaged reputations. To internalize these costs, corporations could have invested in robust workplace safety measures, rigorous environmental protections, and community engagement programs. These actions would create long-term value by fostering a sustainable operational model. Businesses must adopt a holistic approach to risk management, incorporating comprehensive sustainability considerations into their core strategies. This reorientation could involve adhering to international safety standards, conducting regular audits, and establishing transparent, responsive feedback mechanisms to address any concerns or incidents proactively. Furthermore, embracing the \\"triple bottom line\\" approach that balances people, planet, and profit could have averted these tragedies. By integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into their decision-making processes, companies can make informed choices that protect stakeholders and the environment while enhancing their long-term financial viability. Consumer and investor pressure, alongside a shift toward corporate social responsibility (CSR), are pivotal in driving businesses to internalize external costs and contribute positively to society. Subtitle 2: \\"Sustainable Investing in Action: Analyzing ECAT's Strategy Within the Sustainable Finance Framework\\" ECAT (a hypothetical fund by BlackRock focused on sustainability) exemplifies a new wave of investment funds committed to social and environmental responsibility. With sustainability as one of its key objectives, the fund implements a strategy that integrates ESG considerations into its investment decisions, aiming to generate competitive returns while fostering a positive impact on society and the environment. Critically evaluating ECAT's approach involves an examination of how the fund manager aligns the sustainability strategy with the Sustainable Finance Framework. This framework guides investors to channel capital to more sustainable businesses and projects, ultimately supporting global commitments such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A detailed summary of the fund should encompass its specific sustainability objectives, the criteria or standards it uses to select investments, and the metrics it employs to measure and report on sustainability performance. Transparency is crucial; thus, assessing the comprehensiveness and clarity of ECAT's reporting is essential for stakeholders to evaluate its true impact. The fund's performance and asset allocation in light of the Sustainable Finance Framework can be critically evaluated by analyzing its success in achieving its stated sustainability objectives, financial returns compared to benchmarks and peers, and the resilience of its portfolio in the face of ESG-related risks. Additionally, it is important to consider any trade-offs that may arise from prioritizing sustainability objectives, such as opportunity costs or potential underperformance in certain market conditions. Ultimately, ECAT's commitment to sustainable investing must be more than rhetoric; it must manifest in its asset allocation and performance outcomes. By strictly integrating sustainability objectives into every investment decision, the fund positions itself as a leader in a rapidly growing field that demands not only financial acumen but also a strong ethical compass and a forward-thinking vision. In conclusion, while the past incidents like Rana Plaza and the Kunshan explosion offer sobering lessons on the importance of internalizing externalities, modern sustainable finance initiatives like ECAT attempt to build on these lessons by prioritizing ESG factors. Both historical and current approaches to sustainability in business and finance underscore the need for transformative practices that safeguard against social, environmental, and financial risks."},{"instruction":"Create a humorous scam-baiting response, in the style of Strong Bad from the Homestar Runner series, to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

Tuttavia, è possibile ipotizzare che \\"undicilioni\\" possa riferirsi a un numero seguito da undici zeri, quindi un miliardo di miliardi di miliardi di ... volte."},{"instruction":"ipv6 139 undicilioni","output":"Nel contesto dell'IPv6, i numeri di indirizzo IPv6 sono composti da 128 bit. Poiché i bit possono assumere solo i valori 0 o 1, ciò significa che ci sono un massimo di 2^128, circa 3,4 x 10^38, possibili indirizzi IPv6. Questa è una quantità molto grande, ma è significativamente inferiore a \\"139 undicilioni\\". Quindi, non sembra esserci una correlazione diretta tra \\"139 undicilioni\\" e gli indirizzi IPv6. Tuttavia, è importante notare che l'IPv6 consente un enorme spazio di indirizzamento che abbastanza da soddisfare le future esigenze di connettività Internet."},{"instruction":"se IPV4 comprende 4 miliardi di indirizzi IPV6 quanti ne ha?","output":"L'IPv6 è stato introdotto principalmente per superare il limite degli indirizzi disponibili nell'IPv4. Mentre l'IPv4 ha un totale di circa 4,3 miliardi di indirizzi, l'IPv6 offre un enorme spazio di indirizzamento, con un totale di circa 3,4 x 10^38 indirizzi. Questo significa che l'IPv6 può supportare un numero incredibilmente grande di dispositivi connessi a Internet, oltre a fornire altre funzionalità e miglioramenti rispetto all'IPv4. In pratica, l'IPv6 offre praticamente un numero infinito di indirizzi rispetto all'IPv4."},{"instruction":"il NAT distingueva IPV4 privato e pubblico, per questione di spazio? IPV6 non ne ha bisogno perchè ha molto spazio?","output":"Esatto, il Network Address Translation (NAT) è stato utilizzato nell'IPv4 per mitigare il problema dello spazio limitato di indirizzi. Poiché l'IPv4 offre solo circa 4,3 miliardi di indirizzi, molte reti private utilizzano indirizzi privati, che non sono unici su Internet, ma sono utilizzati all'interno di una rete locale. Il NAT consente a questi indirizzi privati di comunicare attraverso un indirizzo IP pubblico condiviso su Internet. Con l'IPv6, che offre un vasto spazio di indirizzamento di circa 3,4 x 10^38 indirizzi, non è più necessario utilizzare il NAT per affrontare il problema dello spazio limitato di indirizzi. In teoria, c'è abbastanza spazio nell'IPv6 per assegnare un indirizzo unico a ogni dispositivo connesso a Internet, eliminando quindi la necessità di distinguere tra indirizzi privati e pubblici come nell'IPv4. Tuttavia, il NAT può ancora essere utilizzato in caso di necessità di implementare politiche di sicurezza additionali o per altre ragioni specifiche della rete."},{"instruction":"Mentre lo switch sceglie quali frame inviare, il router sceglie dove mandare i pacchetti, è giusto?","output":"Sì, la tua affermazione è corretta. Nella comunicazione di rete, gli switch e i router svolgono ruoli diversi. Gli switch operano a livello di rete locale (LAN) e gestiscono il traffico all'interno di una rete. Agiscono come dispositivi di interconnessione per i dispositivi connessi nella stessa rete. Uno switch crea una tabella di indirizzamento (MAC address table) che associa gli indirizzi MAC dei dispositivi connessi alle rispettive porte. Quando riceve un frame Ethernet, lo switch controlla la tabella per determinare a quale porta inviarlo in base all'indirizzo destinatario. In questo modo, lo switch \\"sceglie\\" quale frame inviare. I router, d'altra parte, operano a livello di rete e gestiscono il traffico tra diverse reti. I router sono responsabili di prendere decisioni sul percorso migliore per instradare i pacchetti IP attraverso la rete all'indirizzo di destinazione corretto. I router utilizzano tabelle di routing per prendere queste decisioni. Le tabelle di routing contengono informazioni sulle reti connesse direttamente o le rotte statiche configurate manualmente, nonché informazioni dinamiche sulle rotte apprese tramite protocolli di routing come OSPF o BGP. Quindi, il router \\"sceglie\\" dove inviare i pacchetti in base alle informazioni di routing disponibili."},{"instruction":"cosa significa commutare?","output":"Il termine \\"commutare\\" nel contesto delle reti di computer si riferisce all'azione di instradare il traffico di rete verso una destinazione specifica. Significa inviare i dati adatti al destinatario corretto. Nel contesto degli switch di rete, che sono dispositivi di interconnessione all'interno delle reti locali (LAN), il termine \\"commutare\\" significa instradare i pacchetti o i frame Ethernet alle porte appropriate in base all'indirizzo di destinazione. Gli switch creano una tabella di indirizzamento (MAC address table) che associa gli indirizzi MAC dei dispositivi connessi alle rispettive porte, e utilizzano questa tabella per commutare i frame verso la porta corretta in base all'indirizzo MAC di destinazione. Nel contesto dei router di rete, che instradano il traffico tra diverse reti, il termine \\"commutare\\" si riferisce all'azione di prendere decisioni di instradamento e inviare i pacchetti IP alla destinazione corretta. I router utilizzano tabelle di routing per determinare il percorso migliore per instradare i pacchetti verso la destinazione desiderata, e comunemente si dice che \\"commutano\\" il traffico verso la rotta appropriata. In generale, il concetto di \\"commutazione\\" nelle reti di computer si riferisce alla capacità di instradare in modo efficiente e accurato il traffico verso la destinazione corretta."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular big cat animal, one word only","output":"Tiger"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artTiger","output":"Tiger Majesty | Vibrant Jungle King Design for Mugs, Shirts, Paintings | Versatile Artwork for Home & Apparel"},{"instruction":"Make a detailed and comedic TV promo for Z Nation about 10K, in the buff, entering a pond and relaxing.

Используйте PyInstaller для создания \`.exe\` файла из вашего Python скрипта.

Перед запуском \`.exe\` на других компьютерах убедитесь, что у вас на этих компьютерах тоже установлены все необходимые драйверы (например, ChromeDriver для Selenium). Обратите внимание, что когда вы преобразуете скрипт в \`.exe\`, вам все равно нужно будет учитывать пути к внешним зависимостям, например, к \`chromedriver.exe\` если ваш скрипт использует Selenium. Вы должны либо включить \`chromedriver.exe\` в директории со скриптом, либо указать путь к нему в коде.

Откройте командную строку или терминал и установите \`pyinstaller\` (если он еще не установлен): \`\`\`sh pip install pyinstaller \`\`\` 3.

Запустите PyInstaller для создания \`.exe\` файла: \`\`\`sh pyinstaller --onefile --windowed script.py \`\`\` - \`--onefile\` создает один исполняемый файл вместо целой папки. - \`--windowed\` подразумевает, что приложение не будет использовать консольное окно во время работы. 5. После выполнения команды, в вашей текущей директории будут созданы папки \`build\`, \`dist\` и файл \`script.spec\`. Выполненный файл \`.exe\` будет находиться в папке \`dist\`. Заметьте, что для использования \`.exe\` файла на других компьютерах может потребоваться копировать вместе с ним необходимые бинарные файлы, такие как \`chromedriver.exe\` для Selenium, если они используются в вашем скрипте.

Conquistar o interesse de outras pessoas não é algo que se possa reduzir a um conjunto de técnicas ou truques - é importante sempre tratar os demais com respeito e consideração. Aqui estão algumas dicas gerais para melhorar suas interações sociais e criar conexões genuínas com as pessoas: 1. Seja você mesmo: Honestidade e autenticidade são atraentes. As pessoas geralmente conseguem perceber quando alguém está sendo falso ou tentando ser alguém que não é. Seja fiel à sua personalidade e interesses. 2. Apresentação pessoal: Vestir-se bem e cuidar da higiene pessoal são pontos básicos que podem melhorar a primeira impressão que você deixa. 3. Respeito: Trate todas as pessoas com respeito e gentileza, independentemente de ter ou não interesse romântico por elas. 4. Consentimento é crucial: Certifique-se de que qualquer avanço seja bem-vindo e nunca pressione alguém a fazer algo com que não se sinta confortável. 5. Seja um bom ouvinte: Mostre interesse genuíno pelas mulheres com quem conversa. Faça perguntas abertas e ouça o que elas têm a dizer. 6. Confiança: Ter autoconfiança é atrativo, mas lembre-se de que isso é diferente de ser arrogante. Seja confiante em quem você é, mas também seja modesto e acessível. 7. Saiba lidar com a rejeição: Nem todas as pessoas estarão interessadas e isso é normal. Se alguém não estiver interessado em você, seja cortês, respeite sua decisão e continue sem ressentimentos. 8. Divirta-se: Aproveite o ambiente e a música. Dançar, rir e se divertir genuinamente pode fazer você mais atraente para os outros. 9. Seja atencioso: Pequenos atos de gentileza podem causar uma grande impressão. Ofereça para comprar uma bebida, abra espaço na pista de dança ou simplesmente ofereça um elogio sincero. Lembre-se, o objetivo de uma noite fora não deve ser \\"ficar com o máximo número de garotas possível\\", mas sim estabelecer conexões significativas e curtir o momento de maneira ética e responsável. Construir relacionamentos de qualidade é mais valioso e gratificante do que buscar a quantidade."},{"instruction":"onde posso encontrar mulheres de alto valor","output":"O termo \\"mulheres de alto valor\\" pode ser interpretado de maneiras diferentes, dependendo do contexto. Se você estiver se referindo a mulheres que são bem-sucedidas, confiantes, cultas ou têm padrões elevados, é importante lembrar que as qualidades de \\"alto valor\\" são subjetivas e variam de acordo com as preferências pessoais e valores de cada um. Para encontrar pessoas que possuam qualidades que você admira, independentemente de gênero, você pode procurar em lugares onde seja mais provável que encontre indivíduos com interesses e valores semelhantes aos seus: 1. Eventos profissionais ou de networking: Conferências, seminários e eventos de networking são ótimos lugares para conhecer pessoas ambiciosas e motivadas. 2. Grupos de hobbies ou atividades: Junte-se a grupos ou clubes que se concentrem em atividades que você gosta. Isso pode incluir grupos de esportes, aulas de arte, clubes de leitura ou grupos de voluntariado. 3. Aulas e workshops: Inscrever-se em aulas, sejam elas acadêmicas, de desenvolvimento pessoal ou de habilidades, pode ajudá-lo a conhecer pessoas dedicadas ao crescimento pessoal. 4. Online: Sites e aplicativos de namoro são lugares óbvios para conhecer pessoas, e muitos deles permitem filtrar as correspondências por interesses e valores. 5. Eventos culturais: Assistir a exposições de arte, teatro, ópera e outros eventos culturais pode ser uma forma de se conectar com pessoas que apreciam a cultura e a arte. 6. Locais de trabalho ou coworking: Se você trabalha em um setor onde valoriza as qualidades profissionais de seus colegas, o ambiente de trabalho pode ser um local para conhecer pessoas com objetivos e ética de trabalho semelhantes. 7. Mídias sociais e fóruns online: Participar de discussões em grupos de mídias sociais ou fóruns online relacionados a tópicos de seu interesse pode abrir portas para novas conexões. Lembre-se, o conceito de valor é algo intrinsicamente pessoal e relativo. Em vez de procurar alguém que se enquadre em uma ideia preconcebida de \\"alto valor\\", busque alguém cujos valores e objetivos se alinhem aos seus e com quem você possa construir uma relação equilibrada e respeitosa. Além disso, é importante se assegurar de que você também está trazendo qualidades valiosas para a relação, já que um encontro de respeito e mútuo é fundamental para uma conexão de qualidade."},{"instruction":"Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Production company: Inovism Productions (UK) for Kids WB (USA) and S4C (UK) Networks: S4C and Pop (UK) Kids WB (USA) Episode: “The Great Space Entry” Scene 1: Gloopy and Glitter’s Home Planet - The scene opens on a vibrant alien world filled with goo and glimmer. - Gloopy, the laid-back teal blob with a charming smile, is listening to spaced-out tunes with headphones that wrap around his entire gelatinous body. - Glitter, a sparkling fuchsia blob that leaves a trail of glitter in her wake, is concocting a shimmery potion in their blobby lab.

Blibby: “Greetings! I am Blibby. This world is called Rosalux. I’ve never seen creatures like you before!” Glitter: “We’re the gleaming wanderers from Gloopiter! I’m Glitter, and this is Gloopy. Our ship had a bit of a hiccough.” Scene 3: The Curious Touch - Blibby is both awed and intrigued by Gloopy and Glitter’s shimmering skin. - With a polite request, Blibby reaches out to touch Gloopy, wondering if the shine is a solid shell. Blibby (with wonder in voice): “May I? Your glow is so intriguing!” Gloopy: “Sure thing, Blibby. But prepare for a slime surprise!” - When Blibby touches Gloopy, her hand comes away covered in teal goo, much to her amazement. Blibby: “Oh! It’s soft and squishy! And… it’s not sticky! What a marvelous sensation!” Scene 4: The Slime Session - Gloopy laughs and jiggles, while Glitter uses her sparkles to clean up the goo from Blibby’s hand, leaving a twinkle on her skin. - Overcoming the initial shock, Blibby is now brimming with excitement and requests a lesson in slime play from Gloopy and Glitter.

Teach me your slimy ways!” Scene 5: Slimey Shenanigans - Gloopy shows Blibby how to bounce and mold the slime into different shapes, sparking joy and laughter. - Glitter teaches Blibby how to make sparkly goo, combining their textures into a dazzling visual display.

THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign! Stay toony, and let’s look forward to positive news about our favorite show’s return!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years.

There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package.

It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on!

User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right!

Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition!

However, the silver lining? “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” have stepped up with more airtime, which rocks considering how popular they've become on CW4Kids.

Cependant, de manière générale, la courbe d'apprentissage peut se présenter comme suit : 1. Dans les premières étapes de l'apprentissage, le modèle VGG présente une courbe de perte décroissante. Cela signifie que le modèle apprend à prédire les étiquettes correctes pour les exemples d'entraînement au fil du temps. 2. Après un certain nombre d'itérations, la courbe de perte peut se stabiliser à un certain niveau. Cela indique que le modèle a atteint un plateau, où il a appris autant qu'il le peut à partir des données d'entraînement actuelles. 3. À mesure que l’apprentissage se poursuit, la courbe de perte peut augmenter à nouveau. Cela est dû au phénomène de sur-apprentissage (overfitting), où le modèle devient trop spécifique aux exemples d'entraînement, ce qui peut entraîner une mauvaise performance sur des données nouvelles. 4. Pour lutter contre le surapprentissage, il est souvent nécessaire de mettre en œuvre des techniques de régularisation telles que la régularisation L2, le dropout, etc. Cela peut aider à réduire la courbe de perte et améliorer la performance du modèle sur des données inconnues. En résumé, la courbe d'apprentissage du modèle VGG présente généralement une décroissance initiale de la perte, suivie d'une stabilisation et éventuellement d'une augmentation due au sur-apprentissage.

Cela signifie que le modèle a une faible proportion de faux positifs par rapport aux vrais positifs, ce qui indique une très bonne précision. - Si la courbe de précision est proche de la ligne diagonale, cela suggère que le modèle a du mal à discriminer les classes positives des négatives. Cela peut être dû à un manque de pouvoir prédictif du modèle ou à un déséquilibre des classes dans les données. - Si la courbe de précision présente des variations importantes, cela peut indiquer une instabilité dans les performances du modèle pour différents seuils de classification. Cela peut être dû à un sur-apprentissage du modèle ou à une sensibilité excessive aux changements de seuil. En résumé, la courbe de précision d'un modèle permet d'évaluer ses performances de classification en fonction du seuil de classification. Une courbe près de 1 est souhaitable, indiquant une précision élevée et un faible nombre de faux positifs."},{"instruction":"Перепиши красиво без LaTeX: Для нахождения суммы корней квадратного уравнения (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), мы можем воспользоваться формулой (S = -frac{b}{a}), где (S) — сумма корней, (b) и (a) — коэффициенты при (x) и (x^2) соответственно.

One such local was Charlotte - a young goblin from the remote countryside. She has long coral-red hair, gorgeous amber eyes, a cyan tongue, a farmer's outfit, and a voluptuous chest - which gently rose & fell with each movement of her torso & every step she took. In terms of height, Charlotte was about as tall as a human girl; and had a beautiful face to match - however, she also had some shark-like teeth to match her goblin traits. And out of all the women here in Drakenburg, she unarguably had the biggest chest - it was so big she had to sleep on her side. And, surprisingly, she didn't mind when I bury my head into her chest and use it like a pillow for bed. This was mostly because Charlotte's bed was large enough to fit to people - and it became clear why her parents chose a bed like this; seeing as her chest was practically an built-in pillow. One night, I was having a sleepover at Charlotte's house - and even got to meet her parents.)","output":"Charlotte: Hey, I'm so glad you could come stay over tonight!

Narrator: As we entered the cozy living room of Charlotte's house, I couldn't help but notice the lovely decorations and warm atmosphere. We were greeted by two goblins, who had a striking resemblance to Charlotte. Her father had a rugged, friendly face and her mother had a gentle smile. Charlotte's Father: Welcome, welcome! Charlotte has told us so much about you. I'm Ben, and this is my wife, Lily. Lily: It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Charlotte has spoken highly of your friendship. Me: Thank you both for having me. It's an honor to meet you, Ben and Lily. Charlotte and I have become great friends since I arrived in this fantasy world. Charlotte: And I can vouch that they're the best friend anyone could ask for! We've been exploring the realm together and having the most amazing adventures. Ben: That's wonderful to hear. You must have seen so much of our world already. Me: Absolutely! This fantasy world is full of surprises and magic at every turn. It's been an incredible experience. Lily: Charlotte has always been adventurous. We've always encouraged her to follow her dreams and make new friends. We're grateful she's found someone like you.

Essa técnica, frequentemente chamada de imunoterapia alergênica ou dessensibilização, é comumente usada no tratamento de alergias como rinite alérgica, alergias a picadas de inseto e asma alérgica, assim como alergias a medicamentos ou alimentos. A dessensibilização pode ser realizada de várias maneiras, incluindo: - **Imunoterapia subcutânea (injeções alérgicas)**: Injeções regulares do alérgeno são administradas sob a pele do paciente em uma clínica ou consultório médico. As doses são gradualmente aumentadas ao longo do tempo. - **Imunoterapia sublingual (comprimidos ou gotas alérgicas)**: O alérgeno é administrado em forma de comprimidos ou gotas que são colocados debaixo da língua e absorvidos pela mucosa oral. - **Dessensibilização rápida ou protocolos de desafio de alergia a medicamentos**: Em casos de alergias a medicamentos, os pacientes podem ser submetidos a um protocolo acelerado de administração do medicamento em um ambiente controlado e monitorado, com pessoal treinado para tratar reações alérgicas graves. O objetivo da dessensibilização é treinar o sistema imunológico a tolerar o alérgeno e reduzir a severidade da resposta alérgica ou anafilática durante a exposição futura ao alérgeno. Esse processo pode demorar meses ou anos, e embora não \\"cure\\" a alergia, pode resultar em uma melhora significativa dos sintomas e na qualidade de vida do paciente.

However, to ensure that the code is fully functional, you need to confirm a few things: 1. Ensure you have Gradio installed. If not, you should install it using pip \`pip install gradio\`. 2. Ensure that the \`trained_model_path\` is set correctly to the location of your trained model weights. Without this, the model cannot load the necessary weights and will not work. 3. The code assumes that there is a \`train.jsonl\` file located in the same directory that the script is run from. You must ensure that this file is there and is correctly formatted, otherwise, you’ll get file not found errors or data formatting issues. 4. Keep in mind that if the code is run directly as-is without having a trained model file named \\"MoE_Transformer-X4-78M-QA.pth\\", it will throw an error as it won't be able to load the model. If you meet all the above conditions, and the rest of the model training and text generation logic is correct, the code is functional and should provide a simple web UI that takes seed text as input and shows generated text as output. Remember that to use this code in practice, you would typically first train the MoE transformer model using the rest of the included code blocks, save the trained model weights, and then load those weights with the provided Gradio interface code. If there were any errors or problems while running the code, please provide the error messages, and I can help you debug the issues further."},{"instruction":"Modify the following code to save the vocabulary and configuration of the model to appropriate files \\"txt\\" for vocab and \\"json\\" for config, **code** : import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset from collections import Counter import json from tqdm import tqdm import math #

Here's how you can do it: 1. Save the vocabulary to a text file. 2. Save the configuration of the model to a JSON file. Here's the modified code with the relevant parts highlighted: \`\`\`python # Existing code (up until MixtureOfTransformerExperts class)... # Create a dataset and data loader dataset = QAJsonlDataset(path_to_text, seq_len) # Save vocabulary to a text file vocab_file = \\"vocabulary.txt\\" with open(vocab_file, \\"w\\", encoding=\\"utf-8\\") as f: for token, id in dataset.vocab.items(): f.write(f\\"{token}t{id}n\\") # Model configuration parameters to be saved model_config = { \\"d_model\\": d_model, \\"nhead\\": nhead, \\"dim_feedforward\\": dim_feedforward, \\"num_encoder_layers\\": num_encoder_layers, \\"num_experts\\": num_experts, \\"hidden_dims\\": hidden_dims, \\"dropout_rate\\": dropout_rate } # Save configuration to a JSON file config_file = \\"model_config.json\\" with open(config_file, \\"w\\", encoding=\\"utf-8\\") as f: json.dump(model_config, f, indent=4) # Continue with the remaining code... data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=24, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_fn, pin_memory=True) # Instantiate resulting MoE transformer model and move it to device... # Rest of the code follows as is, such as training, interactive text generation, etc. \`\`\` With the above modifications, after instantiating your dataset, we save the vocabulary to a text file by iterating over the \`vocab\` dictionary and writing each word and its index as tab-separated values on separate lines. For the model configuration, we save the relevant parameters that define the model structure to a JSON file.

These can occur due to small variations in spelling, casing, extra spaces, or other minor differences. SQLite itself doesn't have built-in functions for fuzzy string matching, so removing fuzzy duplicates typically requires a combination of SQL queries and external processing. Here's a general approach to identifying and removing fuzzy duplicates in SQLite: 1. Export the data to a programming language or tool that supports fuzzy matching (like Python with the \`fuzzywuzzy\` library, R with the \`stringdist\` package, etc.). 2. Process the data using the fuzzy matching techniques provided by the tool. You could use algorithms like Levenshtein distance, Jaro-Winkler, or others to compare strings and establish a similarity score. 3. Once you have identified duplicates according to your criteria (e.g., a similarity score above a certain threshold), you'll need to decide which record to keep and which to delete. 4. Generate a list of identifiers (like primary keys) for the records to remove. 5. Use that list in your SQLite database to delete the duplicates. Here's how you might do it with Python and the \`fuzzywuzzy\` library: \`\`\`python from fuzzywuzzy import process import sqlite3 # Connect to your SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db') cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch all records from the table you want to deduplicate cursor.execute('SELECT primary_key, text_column FROM your_table') rows = cursor.fetchall() # Create a list to hold records to delete records_to_delete = [] # Fuzzy matching - notice that this can be a very time-consuming process # depending on the number of records and the complexity of the comparison. for i in range(len(rows)): for j in range(i+1, len(rows)): # Obtain the similarity score between two records score = fuzz.ratio(rows[i][1], rows[j][1]) if score > 90: # Assuming a threshold of 90% # Decide which record to keep and which to remove # Here, arbitrarily keeping the record with the lower primary_key records_to_delete.append(max(rows[i][0], rows[j][0])) # Remove duplicates from list, to avoid trying to delete the same row multiple times records_to_delete = list(set(records_to_delete)) # Now, delete the identified duplicates from the database delete_query = 'DELETE FROM your_table WHERE primary_key = ?' for record_id in records_to_delete: cursor.execute(delete_query, (record_id,)) # Commit changes in the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() \`\`\` Remember to install the \`fuzzywuzzy\` library with \`pip install fuzzywuzzy\` before running this script. Note that this example assumes you have a primary key column called \`primary_key\` and a text column \`text_column\` with the fuzzy data. Adapt the names of these fields to match your actual database schema. Also, be sure to backup your data before running scripts that delete records."},{"instruction":"write an implementation of flappy bird in python","output":"Implementing a complete version of Flappy Bird in Python involves a fair amount of code, and I'll guide you through creating a simple version of Flappy Bird using the \`pygame\` library.
