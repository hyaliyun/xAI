Possible A: container, internet cafe, starbucks, cup, supermarket  Why is \\"cup\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"The answer \\"cup\\" aligns with human common sense because it directly addresses the practical need and context associated with drinking coffee. To understand this better, let's analyze each of the provided possible answers and their relationship to the question. The question asks, \\"Where would you put some coffee if you are thirsty?\\" This implies that the person is looking for a location or receptacle to pour and consume the coffee. When people are thirsty, they typically consume beverages like coffee by drinking it from an appropriate container. In the case of coffee, the most common and practical container is a cup.  Now, let's evaluate the other possible answers: 1. Container: While a \\"container\\" could technically hold coffee, it's a vague and overly broad term. People usually prefer a cup as it is specifically designed for drinking liquids such as coffee at a comfortable temperature. 2. Internet cafe: An internet cafe is a place where people use computers and access the internet, often while drinking coffee and other beverages. But it is not a suitable receptacle for holding coffee when someone is thirsty. It is a location, but not the specific answer to where you would put the coffee. 3. Starbucks: Starbucks is a well-known coffee shop, and while you can purchase coffee and other drinks there, it does not directly answer where you would put the coffee if you are thirsty. Similar to the \\"internet cafe,\\" it is a location but does not serve as a suitable place to hold the coffee. 4. Supermarket: A supermarket is a place where you can buy packaged coffee beans or grounds, but not somewhere you would put coffee to drink if you are thirsty. It is neither a suitable receptacle nor location for consuming the coffee. In conclusion, \\"cup\\" is the answer that aligns with human common sense because it is the most relevant and practical option for the context of the question. A cup is specifically designed to hold and drink beverages such as coffee, addressing the person's thirst and need in the most efficient and suitable manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 17:08 EST, 3 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 21:11 EST, 3 November 2012. Britain is sitting on a £1.5 trillion shale gas bonanza that could be worth more than the remaining North Sea gas. The amount is bigger than previously thought and would potentially bring energy price stability and independence from imports for decades. Although only about ten per cent  of the gas is in unpopulated areas suitable for extraction, it would still be worth £150 billion. Boost: Britain is sitting on a £1.5 trillion shale gas bonanza that could be worth more than the remaining North Sea gas. It is hoped shale gas can transform the economy in the way North Sea oil did in the Eighties and Nineties. The level of untapped shale gas will be confirmed next month in a study by the British Geological Survey, commissioned by the Department  of Energy and Climate Change, according to industry sources. Ministers are then likely to give the go-ahead for drilling, hoping the enormous economic benefits can win over environmental concerns. But critics say the environmental cost is too high for ‘fracking’ – or hydraulic fracturing, the controversial method of extracting gas by forcing water, sand and chemicals at high pressure 6,000ft underground. Pilot wells caused two earthquakes in Lancashire last year and green campaigners warn the method could contaminate the water supply. US research also says that homeowners within two miles of a fracking site can expect property prices to plummet by almost a quarter. Sources close to Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he was ‘quite excited about the prospect of a new domestic resource and probably wants to be able to exploit it, but it is quite a disruptive process and we need to go in with our eyes open’. Although the shale gas reserves are unlikely to mean a fall in gas prices, there could be enough to prevent expected big increases for years. Oil and gas experts are also hopeful about the high concentration of gas in UK rocks, which is richer than even US shale deposits and would require fewer wells. The Coalition hopes that shale gas can transform the economy in the way North Sea oil did in the Eighties and Nineties. David Cameron has chaired a seminar to which he invited shale gas experts to come to Downing Street. Meanwhile the Chancellor is considering a ‘generous new tax regime’ for drilling companies. Energy  Minister John Hayes is expected to give the go-ahead  for drilling, which has been suspended for the last  year because of safety and environmental concerns. Last year, Cuadrilla Resources suspended its drilling operations after fracking caused two small earthquakes near Blackpool. A senior industry source with  intimate knowledge of the BGS survey said: ‘When the survey announces the size of the reserve, it will be an enormous figure. The potential is that it will be a bigger number than the total recovery from the North Sea.’ Hopeful: Sources close to Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he was 'quite excited' about the prospect of a new domestic resource. Substantial recoverable gas could enhance Britain’s energy security, offset declining North Sea output and reduce import dependence. About 70 per cent of the North Sea gas and oil reserves have been used up and in 20 years Britain will be dependent on gas from abroad – mainly Norway and Qatar. However, only about ten per cent of the shale gas is available for commercial exploitation because much of it has been found in heavily populated areas, such as the North West, North Wales, Isle of Man, South Cumbria, East Midlands and the North East. Many of these areas have already suffered a property price collapse, and so fracking would be likely to provoke fierce opposition. An ICM poll last month showed  67 per cent of homeowners would rather have a wind turbine near their home than a fracking well.  But Cuadrilla claims the estimated 200 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in the Bowland Basin in the North West could create 5,600 jobs. Pro-frackers say the landscape is disturbed for a few months during initial drilling and that the ground can be returned to its former use. But Friends of the Earth claims that the longer-term effects below ground could be catastrophic. Andrew Pendleton, of the charity, said: ‘Our objection to shale gas is there are risks of water contamination by methane and chemicals, and the process involves very high use of water anyway. Then there’s the risk of earth tremors. ‘We don’t think shale gas would even stop the rise in gas prices  anyway and it is another fossil fuel creating carbon. Plus there is the risk methane will leak out, and it is a very powerful greenhouse gas.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. Britain is estimated to have £1.5 trillion worth of shale gas reserves, larger than remaining North Sea gas resources. 2. A study by the British Geological Survey, commissioned by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, will confirm the level of untapped shale gas next month. 3. Approximately 10% of the gas is in unpopulated areas suitable for extraction, which would be worth around £150 billion. 4. Shale gas extraction could help maintain stable energy prices and reduce dependence on imports for decades. 5. The government is expected to approve drilling despite environmental concerns. 6. The shale gas reserves are unlikely to reduce gas prices but could prevent significant increases in the coming years. 7. Gas concentrations in UK rocks are richer than US shale deposits, potentially requiring fewer wells. 8.

Here is a question about this article: The body’s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium. Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity. Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells. Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage. B cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active. What is the answer to this question: Why are newborns described as being physiologically immunodeficient?","output":"Newborns are described as being physiologically immunodeficient because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. This suppression is due to several factors, such as: 1. Lower opsonic activity and limited ability to activate the complement cascade, resulting in reduced effectiveness in identifying and eliminating pathogens. 2. Impaired phagocytic activity in newborns, attributed to lower opsonic activity, diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, slow monocytes, and reduced ATP production. This limits their ability to effectively neutralize and eliminate pathogens via neutrophils and monocytes. 3. Although newborns have a higher number of total lymphocytes compared to adults, their cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired. Antigen-presenting cells have a reduced capability to activate T cells, as well as a reduced production of cytokines that are essential to activate the humoral response and macrophage phagocytic activity. These factors contribute to the physiological immunodeficiency in newborns and make them more susceptible to infections, particularly from low virulence organisms such as Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gardestad was wrongly mentioned in the Swedish media as \\"the 33-year-old\\", a suspect in the investigation of the assassination, which severely affected him although Gardestad was on vacation in Greece at the time of the murder, and although he was never questioned by the Swedish police nor was under suspicion by the authorities, the speculations and rumours followed him and his family for the rest of the 1980s. A few years later, he was again the subject of rumours accusing him of being Lasermannen, a bank robber and serial killer. The rumours affected the sensitive and already unstable former star, and Gardestad withdrew and fell into a deep depression.  In the early 1990s, Gardestad was briefly coaxed out of retirement by his friend and fellow Swedish pop singer Harpo. He joined Harpo on a concert tour and made guest appearances. In 1992, they released the duet \\"Lycka\\" (\\"Happiness\\") as a single; it garnered little attention but marked Gardestad's return to music. Early that year he embarked on his first tour since 1978 and played a series of dates with Plura Jonsson, Tove Naess, Totta Naslund and Dan Hylander, and received overall positive reviews from the press.  In 1993, a compilation album titled Kalendarium 1972-93 was promoted by a tour in the Swedish folkparks; the album and tour were successful, as was his first composition in twelve years, \\"For karlekens skull\\" (\\"For Love's Sake\\"), which topped the Svensktoppen chart. The Kalendarium collection included a Swedish-language re-recording of the title track from Blue Virgin Isles, \\"Himlen ar oskyldigt bla\\" (\\"The Sky is Innocently Blue\\"), which fifteen years after its original release became another Svensktoppen hit, and became one of his best-known songs. In early 1994, Kalendarium 1972-93 was awarded a platinum disc. All of Gardestad's albums from the 1970s and early 1980s, with the exception of Blue Virgin Isles, were re-released on CD by Polar, and a generation of Swedes who grew up listening to his music now re-discovered and re-evaluated his back catalogue as adults. His body of work has since come to be regarded as a national treasure as important as those of Evert Taube, Carl Michael Bellman and Cornelis Vreeswijk both by fans and Swedish music critics.

House Republicans offered their own proposal Monday in the heated battle to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, but it was quickly rebuffed by President Barack Obama's administration for not demanding more from the nation's wealthiest taxpayers. The GOP plan promises 2.2 trillion in deficit savings over the next decade, including 800 billion from tax reform, 600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and 600 billion in other spending cuts, House Republican leadership aides said. It also pledges 200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index, a measure of inflation. House Speaker John Boehner called it a \\"credible plan that deserves serious consideration by the White House.\\" The move follows spitting back and forth in recent weeks, with each side claiming the other isn't sincere about striking a deal to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts in January, a scenario many economists say would hurt the U.S. economy. Senior Obama administration officials slammed the Republican plan, calling it a step backward in negotiations and not worthy of its own counteroffer because it isn't serious enough. Opinion: Beware the fiscal cliff deniers. White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer criticized it for not meeting \\"the test of balance.\\" Another Obama spokesman, Jay Carney, earlier said the president \\"will not sign a bill that extends those tax rates for the top 2%,\\" as the GOP proposal would do. \\"Until the Republicans in Congress are willing to get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates, we won't be able to achieve a significant, balanced approach to reduce our deficit,\\" Pfeiffer said. Republicans make budget counter-offer. Republicans offered the plan amid pressure for a House vote -- which Boehner has so far prevented -- on a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than 250,000 a year and to allow rates to return to Clinton-era levels for wealthier households. Lower tax rates set in 2001 and 2003 were extended for two years as part of budget talks in 2010. In line with his stances during his first term and re-election campaign, Obama's deficit-reduction plan would increase tax revenue by almost 1 trillion over 10 years, a significant cut of a 4 trillion overall deficit reduction goal. In addition to adding a 50 billion stimulus package, his proposal closes loopholes, limits deductions, raises the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends. Opinion: A tax we could learn to love. Yet Republicans, led by Boehner, have objected to any increase in tax rates, even for the wealthiest Americans. They have said an agreement must include major reforms of entitlement programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health-care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. Their plan offered Monday proposed 800 billion in deficit savings through tax reform, including an unspecified amount of revenue raised by eliminating tax deductions and loopholes. The GOP letter said the offer is based on a framework proposed last year by Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and one-time White House chief of staff who co-chaired a bipartisan deficit reduction panel appointed by Obama in 2010. \\"This is by no means an adequate long-term solution, as resolving our long-term fiscal crisis will require fundamental entitlement reform,\\" the letter said. \\"Indeed, the Bowles plan is exactly the kind of imperfect, but fair middle ground that allows us to avert the fiscal cliff without hurting our economy and destroying jobs.\\" GOP, break Grover Norquist's grip on you. In his response, Pfeiffer said the Republican proposal \\"includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate, which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve.\\" \\"Independent analysts who have looked at plans like this one have concluded that middle class taxes will have to go up to pay for lower rates for millionaires and billionaires,\\" he said. And Bowles denied any direct connection to the GOP proposal, saying it reflected his view of a middle-ground approach a year ago but \\"circumstances have changed since then.\\" \\"It is up to negotiators to figure out where the middle ground is today,\\" Bowles said. Recent posturing on both sides -- such as Boehner saying this weekend he was \\"flabbergasted\\" by Obama's plan -- reflects mistrust built up over two years of deficit wars that have left Congress with a reputation for dysfunction. 5 ways you would stop the fiscal cliff. In 2011, Republicans demanded major budget cuts before they authorized a hike in the federal debt ceiling, a fight that contributed to a U.S. credit rating downgrade. The end of that crisis was a temporary fix that set up the current crisis, which sets the stage for sharp and widespread tax increases and the start of budget cuts of 1 trillion over 10 years if there is no agreement. Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil and threaten the U.S. credit rating. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about 2,000 a year more in taxes without action. According to a CNN/ORC International Poll released last week, 56% of respondents said higher taxes were a fair tradeoff if it helps lower-income people, while 36% said taxes should be kept low to create jobs. Listen: WWJD...about taxes? Another survey, by ABC News and the Washington Post, showed two thirds of respondents support Obama's call for holding down tax rates for everyone except the wealthiest Americans. So what happens next? Senior Obama administration officials said Monday the GOP's plan was a nonstarter, primarily because they said it would actually lower tax rates for those in the top 2% income bracket and was too short on specifics. But even with no more offers officially in the works, both sides will keep talking, the officials said. That may happen as soon as Monday night, when all members of Congress are invited to a holiday reception at which they can talk to, among others, the president himself. Defense companies see cuts coming even with a budget deal. CNN's Ashley Killough, Adam Levy, Deirdre Walsh and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has been pictured visiting a seafood factory shortly after conducting a controversial missile test which has worsened relations with South Korea. In echoes of David Cameron's photo opportunity in a fish market in Portugal last week, Kim inspected the newly commissioned Kalma foodstuff factory in Kangwon province today. Kim was all smiles during the official visit, despite earlier conducting a high-precision missile test that was widely condemned by neighboring South Korea. Kim Jong Un visits a seafood factory in North Korea today a day after controversial missile tests. Kim laughed and joked with staff from the Kalma factory in the country's southern Kangwon province. Kim is often pictured giving 'field guidance' to the country's workers as part of government propaganda. South Korea protested that one of the missiles was fired just half an hour before the Pope was due to land in the southern nation while conducting his first visit to Asia. The rockets were fired from multiple launchers in the North Korean port city of Wonsan and travelled 135 miles before landing in waters east of the Korean peninsula, a South Korean defence ministry official said yesterday. However, an official from North Korea dismissed the idea that the launches had anything to do with the Pope's visit as 'nonsense'. Kim In Yong, research director at the Second Academy of Natural Sciences, said:'The test firing of ultra-precision high-performance tactical rockets was conducted on the scheduled day and time along with our plan to strengthen our self defensive power. 'Our scientists do not know what the pope has done for the people of the world, and especially for our nation, and we don't feel any necessity to know about it. Some of the pictures bear an eerie resemblance to pictures taken of David and Samantha Cameron last week. The day before visiting the fish factory Kim was pictured joking with military chiefs as he tested missiles. The missile test was widely condemned by neighbour South Korea as it prepares for military exercises. 'And we don't know and are not interested in the purpose of his visit to Korea.' The launches preceded the start of U.S.-South Korean military exercises set for Monday. Seoul and Washington say the exercises are purely defensive but North Korea regularly protests against what it sees as a rehearsal for war. In Friday's statement, Kim said the South should call off the drills in order to promote a peaceful atmosphere ahead of the Asian Games, set for next month in Incheon, South Korea. North Korea last fired short-range rockets in late July but has since said repeatedly that the launches are specifically designed as counter measures against those drills. 'Given that the U.S. and the puppet forces of South Korea continue staging nuclear war exercises against us in particular, we will take countermeasures for self-defence which will include missile launches, nuclear tests and all other programmes,' a statement carried by North Korean state media last Friday said.

It leans because of a mistake. It has leaned almost since the day the tower was built. In 1173, the people of Pisa, Italy, wanted to build a bell tower. They wanted the tower to be the most beautiful bell tower in all of Italy. The city also needed a bell tower because the church did not have one. However, there was a problem. As soon as the first floor of the building was finished, the tower started to lean. Builders tried to make the building straight again as they added more floors, but they couldn't figure out how to make it stop leaning. It took almost 180 years to finish the tower. Since then, the tower has leaned by another millimeter every year. Today, the Leaning Tower has eight floors and is 54.5 meters tall. By 1990, it was leaning by about 4 meters to one side. It was also slowly sinking into the ground. Many people became worried that it would soon fall apart. In 1998, repair works began on the tower, and by the end of 2001, it had been moved back by 45 centimeters. The tower will still lean, however, so it will need to be repaired again---in another 200 years. Question: why did the people of  Pisa want to build the tower? - They needed a new church - They wanted to build the tallest tower in Tower - They needed a bell tower. - They wanted to build a leaning tower.

Moreover, the citizens of Ecuador are receptive about the idea of increased biodiversity. On the contrary, the Government of Oman was not very active in increasing the biodiversity of their country. As a result, Oman, at present, is not very biodiverse.  Would Oman have less or more stable ecosystem funcions than Ecuador?  Hint: \\"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.\\" Answer:","output":"Oman would have less stable ecosystem functions than Ecuador.

The Great Mall of the Bay Area (often simply called The Great Mall) is a large indoor outlet shopping mall in Milpitas, California built by Ford Motor Land Development and Petrie Dierman Kughn in 1994. It was acquired by Mills Corporation in 2003, and by the Simon Property Group in April 2007. The mall contains approximately 1.4 million square feet of gross leaseable area. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The Great Mall is an outdoor shopping mall","output":"The next sentence does not follow the given preceding text. In the initial information provided, it is stated that The Great Mall of the Bay Area is a large indoor outlet shopping mall. This clearly indicates that the mall is completely indoors, contrary to the statement in the next sentence suggesting that The Great Mall is an outdoor shopping mall. The Great Mall of the Bay Area, which originally opened its doors in 1994, has been through a series of ownership changes, eventually being acquired by the Simon Property Group in 2007. It boasts 1.4 million square feet of gross leaseable area, providing ample space for retailers and various other establishments to set up shop. As an indoor outlet mall, The Great Mall offers several advantages to both shoppers and retailers. First and foremost, it provides a climate-controlled environment, allowing visitors to shop in comfort, regardless of the weather outside. This can be particularly beneficial during hot summer months or cold and rainy winter days when outdoor shopping centers can be less appealing. Furthermore, with so much retail space available, a wide range of stores and outlets can co-exist, offering customers a diverse selection of brands and discounts under one roof. In addition to the shopping facilities, The Great Mall of the Bay Area also features numerous dining and entertainment options, making it a popular destination for an all-day outing. Food courts, sit-down restaurants, a movie theater, and other entertainment facilities are often available, providing shoppers with a comfortable and enjoyable experience while they take a break from browsing the stores.

Options: - human being - bar - haunted saloon - graveyard - haunted house  The answer is \\"graveyard\\" because A:","output":"The answer is \\"graveyard\\" because the context provided in the question suggests that the setting is supernatural and eerie, involving spirits and aimless wandering. A graveyard is the most fitting location for such a scene, as it is typically associated with the presence of ghosts and spirits, who might be lingering there after their burial. Let's analyze each option to understand why the graveyard is the best choice: - Human being: This is not a location, so it can't be the answer for the question. - Bar: This is a public place where people gather for socializing and recreation. Although it may have its own stories and myths, it's not a typical setting for spirits to wander aimlessly. - Haunted saloon: Similar to a bar, it is also a place where people visit for amusement and socializing. Despite being haunted, it's not the ideal location for a spirit to wander without a purpose. - Graveyard: As previously mentioned, this is the correct answer due to its connections with the supernatural, death, and the lingering of spirits. - Haunted house: While it might be a valid location for spirits, it may not best suit the aimless wandering of spirits, who are more likely to have a connection to the specific house and its history.

Question: Which famous racehorse, winner of all his 18 races, is an ancestor of over 90% of all racehorses? Answer:","output":"The famous racehorse, winner of all his 18 races and ancestor of over 90% of all racehorses, is Eclipse. Born on April 1, 1764, during a solar eclipse, this legendary Thoroughbred racehorse rose to prominence during the 18th century in England and became one of the most celebrated names in the history of horse racing. Eclipse was sired by Marske, a moderately successful racehorse and a grandson of the influential Darley Arabian, one of the three founding stallions of modern Thoroughbred racehorses. Eclipse's dam, Spilletta, was a daughter of Regulus, who was one of the dominating racehorses in England in the early 18th century. This exceptional lineage would play a significant role in Eclipse's success as a racer and subsequent influence on the breed as a whole. Eclipse's racing career spanned from 1769 to 1770. During these two years, he was undefeated in all his races and established himself as a force to be reckoned with on the turf. Not only did Eclipse possess impressive speed, but he also demonstrated incredible stamina and a strong temperament that made him a formidable competitor. These qualities led to a sizable number of walkovers, where no other horse was willing to vie with him, further demonstrating his dominance in the sport. Following Eclipse's retirement from racing in 1771, he embarked on a remarkable career as a stud. He was bred to a variety of mares, resulting in the production of numerous successful offspring. Eclipse passed on his exceptional genetic traits, including speed, stamina, and temperament, to subsequent generations of racehorses. His sons and daughters went on to achieve great success on the racecourse, further magnifying Eclipse's influence on the Thoroughbred breed. Some of Eclipse's most notable offspring and descendants include: 1. Pot-8-Os: A successful racehorse and influential sire. 2. King Fergus: A leading sire in England. 3. American Eclipse: A champion racehorse and leading sire in the United States during the early 19th century. 4. Sir Archy: A foundation sire of the American Thoroughbred. 5. Hermit: Winner of the 1867 Epsom Derby and later a renowned sire. Today, it is estimated that over 90% of all Thoroughbred racehorses can trace their lineage back to Eclipse. This astounding figure showcases the lasting impact Eclipse has had on the equine world and the breeding of racehorses in general. Eclipse's legacy will continue to shape the Thoroughbred breed for years to come, as his genes are responsible for the athleticism and prowess seen in modern racehorses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Moses Kiptanui was born on October 1, 1970, in Marakwet District, which was part of the former Rift Valley Province in Kenya. He is a middle and long-distance athlete, mostly famous for the 3,000-meter steeplechase in which he was the number one ranked athlete from 1991 to 1995 and a three-time IAAF World Champion.

Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators. contains an answer for the question: Where did the person who is re-making the Sissinghurst garden serve before taking on the project?, what is it ?

Article: Sports shoes that work out whether their owner has done enough exercise to promise time in front of the television have been devised in the UK. The shoes- named Square Eyes- contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter   passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves , based on the day's efforts. The design was inspired by a desire to fight against the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, says Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London, UK. \\"We looked at current issues and childhood overweight really stood out,\\" she says. \\"And I wanted to tackle that with my design.\\" Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise, the television automatically   switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps. Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals exactly one minute of TV time. Existing pedometers  normally clip onto a belt or slip into a pocket and keep count of steps by measuring sudden movement. Swan says these can be easily tricked into recording steps through shaking. But her shoe has been built to be harder for lazy teenagers to cheat. \\"It is possible, but it would be a lot of effort,\\" she says. \\"That was one of my main design considerations.\\" Question: Which of the following is true of Square Eyes shoes?

When Jon and Sandy go to the store or to their daughters' soccer games, they drive in high-tech style. They drive a 1 million, fuel-cell-powered car. It may be the world's most expensive car and one of the most environmentally friendly cars. The FCX is the first fuel-cell-powered car to be used by a family anywhere in the world. The FCX uses hydrogen and oxygen for fuel. Car makers have been working to develop vehicles that are better for the environment. They are developing cars that use fuel other than gasoline. And then what is fuel cell technology? Fuel cell technology works by changing the chemicals hydrogen and oxygen into water. This process produces electricity, and water vapor which comes out of the exhaust pipe. Most cars release dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Many scientists say these gases are major contributors to global warming. \\"The FCX is driven just like any other vehicle on the road, but without the gases which pollute the environment,\\" scientists say. Fuel cell technology has been around since the 1800s, but scientists have yet been to perfect it. They say it may take years before the technology is ready for widespread use.

Background: John Anthony Gillis was born in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest of ten children--and the seventh son--of Teresa (nee Bandyk) and Gorman M. Gillis. His mother's family was Polish, while his father was Scottish-Canadian. He was raised a Catholic, and his father and mother both worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. Gillis became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. Context: On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of the Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, was fined 750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes.  White has repeatedly referenced conflicts that erupted between him and fellow artists in Detroit's underground music scene after The White Stripes gained international success. In a 2006 interview with the Associated Press, he said that he eventually left Detroit because, \\"he could not take the negativity anymore.\\" However, in an effort to clarify his feelings towards the city of Detroit itself, he wrote and released a poem called \\"Courageous Dream's Concern.\\" In it, he expresses his affection for his hometown.  During their 2013 divorce proceedings, Elson entered into evidence an e-mail White had sent her that included disparaging remarks about The Black Keys. When asked about the email in a 2014 Rolling Stone magazine interview, White stood by the remarks saying, \\"I'll hear TV commercials where the music's ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it's me. Half the time, it's the Black Keys.\\" He later apologized for the comments. However, in September 2015, Patrick Carney of the band posted a series of tweets alleging that White tried to fight him in a bar. White denied the claim in a statement to the online magazine Pitchfork, saying that Carney should talk to him directly, and not on the internet. The following day, Carney posted a tweet saying, \\"Talked to jack for an hour he's cool. All good.\\" White tweeted on the Third Man Twitter account, \\"From one musician to another, you have my respect Patrick Carney.\\"  On February 1, 2015, the University of Oklahoma's newspaper OU Daily ran a story regarding White's February 2 show at McCasland Field House that included the publication of White's tour rider. The rider, especially the guacamole recipe it included and White's ban of bananas backstage, received significant media coverage. It was later reported that in response to the rider's publication White's booking agency, William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, had banned its acts from playing shows at the University of Oklahoma. On February 15 White released an open letter addressed to \\"journalists and other people looking for drama or a diva\\" in which he referred to the guacamole recipe as his tour manager's \\"inside joke with local promoters\\" and \\"just something to break up the boredom\\" while criticizing journalists who wrote about the rider as \\"out of their element.\\" In the same letter he forgave OU Daily for publishing the story and reaffirmed his desire to perform in Oklahoma.  In October 2016--upon learning that Donald Trump had used the White Stripes' song \\"Seven Nation Army\\" in video campaign materials--White denounced the presidential candidate, and began selling shirts reading \\"Icky Trump\\" through the Third Man Records website. Question: For what reason is Jack White controversial? Answer:","output":"Jack White is considered controversial for several reasons, including his involvement in physical altercations with other musicians, conflicts within the Detroit underground music scene, his public feuds with fellow artists like The Black Keys, disparaging remarks and apologies, and his reactions to leaked concert riders and political affiliations.

So, I am starving I just got home from working on the strip and I work at Bar too that closes at one in the morning that is why I called to ask. My husband and I walk inside and sit right in front of the bar at one of the high tops it was 15 mins before anyone came to greet us or give us any menus. Finally, a male bartender came and greeted us he was friendly but was in a rush to get our order he just handed us the menu and asked \\"Do you know what you want?\\" We needed a min and did not ask if we wanted some thing to drink or nothing just \\"I assumed you been here before\\". Retarded how can you say that to a guest. So, he came around sooner than I thought to take our order the way it was going we asked for it to go. I ordered the chicken dinner with rice and veggies; my man got a bucket of buffalo wings with extra buffalo on the side and an order of fried cheese. Then he asks do you want a drink while you wait we both said no it is okay.( In my head you'd probably bring it when the food is ready anyway.)  So it took 30 to 45 mins for the bar food to come out; we had paid before hand too and had to go up to the bar to ask the bartender how much longer that's when he finally got the food. I guess he noticed we gave him 20% and was extremely fast and nice I walked out My husband stayed to get some ranch to go. When we get home his wings were PLAIN we hand to melt butter and mix it with franks to toss the wings in to make them buffalo. Other than that the food was good the veggies did not seem fresh if anything they are frozen or canned. This review got two stars because the male bartender was nice and food was okay.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Christopher Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa, which is located in present-day Italy. Although the exact location of his birth has been a topic of debate among historians, it is widely believed that Columbus was born in Genoa, a major seaport city at the time. Christopher Columbus, the famous explorer, and navigator of the 15th century are well-known for his ambitious voyages to the Americas. He completed four expeditions across the Atlantic Ocean, which paved the way for Europeans to further explore and colonize the Americas. Born in 1451 to Domenico Colombo, a middle-class wool weaver, and his wife, Susanna Fontanarossa, Christopher grew up in a family of modest means. He had three brothers and a sister, and though not much is known about his early life, it is believed that he worked with his father in the weaving trade during his youth. At that time, the Republic of Genoa was an independent city-state with a thriving economy, based on trade and maritime ventures. This maritime culture provided young Columbus with the necessary drive and opportunity to pursue a life at sea. By the age of 14, Columbus had embarked upon his first sea voyages, working on various merchant ships and developing skills that would later aid him in his explorations. As he progressed in his maritime career, Columbus became deeply fascinated with geographical texts and theories. He was particularly influenced by the ideas of contemporary thinkers like Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, who posited that a westward route to Asia might be possible. This idea fueled Columbus's determination to find such a route, and with support from the Catholic monarchs of Spain, King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I, he embarked upon his first voyage in 1492. Though Columbus's voyages did not lead to the discovery of a direct westward route to Asia, they resulted in the European exploration and subsequent colonization of the Americas, which had a profound impact on the history of the world. Despite controversies surrounding his methods and the consequences of his expeditions, Christopher Columbus remains an iconic figure in world history. In summary, Christopher Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa, in present-day Italy. His early life in this maritime city-state inspired him to follow a life at sea, and his ambitions ultimately led to the European discovery of the Americas, changing the course of history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Richard Allen Posner (; born January 11, 1939) is an American jurist and economist who was a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago from 1981 until 2017, and is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School. He is a leading figure in the field of law and economics, and was identified by The Journal of Legal Studies as the most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. Posner is known for his scholarly range and for writing on topics outside of his primary field, law. Context: In Posner's youth and in the 1960s as law clerk to William J. Brennan he was generally counted as a liberal. However, in reaction to some of the perceived excesses of the late 1960s, Posner developed a strongly conservative bent. He encountered Chicago School economists Aaron Director and George Stigler while a professor at Stanford. Posner summarized his views on law and economics in his 1973 book The Economic Analysis of Law.  Today, although generally viewed as to the right in academia, Posner's pragmatism, his qualified moral relativism and moral skepticism, and his affection for the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche set him apart from most American conservatives. As a judge, with the exception of his rulings with respect to the sentencing guidelines and the recording of police actions, Posner's judicial votes have always placed him on the moderate-to-liberal wing of the Republican Party, where he has become more isolated over time. In July 2012, Posner stated, \\"I've become less conservative since the Republican Party started becoming goofy.\\" Among Posner's judicial influences are the American jurists Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and Learned Hand.  In June 2016, Posner was criticized by right-wing media organizations for a column he wrote for Slate in which he stated, \\"I see absolutely no value to a judge of spending decades, years, months, weeks, day, hours, minutes, or seconds studying the Constitution, the history of its enactment, its amendments, and its implementation.\\"  He has called his approach to judging pragmatic. \\"I pay very little attention to legal rules, statutes, constitutional provisions... A case is just a dispute. The first thing you do is ask yourself -- forget about the law -- what is a sensible resolution of this dispute? The next thing...is to see if a recent Supreme Court precedent or some other legal obstacle stood in the way of ruling in favor of that sensible resolution. And the answer is that's actually rarely the case. When you have a Supreme Court case or something similar, they're often extremely easy to get around.\\" Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects about the article: 1. Posner's shift in political views: The article highlights Posner's shift from being a liberal during his youth to developing a conservative bent. It provides insight into his encounters with Chicago School economists Aaron Director and George Stigler and his views on law and economics, as detailed in his 1973 book, \\"The Economic Analysis of Law.\\" 2. Posner's unique position within the conservative spectrum: Although considered to be in the right-wing of academia, the article emphasizes that Posner's pragmatism, moral relativism and skepticism, and appreciation for Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy set him apart from mainstream American conservatives. 3. His judicial philosophy: Posner's pragmatic approach to judging focuses on finding a sensible resolution to disputes irrespective of legal rules, statutes, and constitutional provisions. This distinctive perspective makes him a notable figure in the world of law and economics. 4. Influence of American jurists: The article mentions Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and Learned Hand as influences on Posner's judicial thought. 5. Controversial statements: Posner has made controversial remarks in regards to studying the Constitution, which has drawn criticism from right-wing media organizations. This controversy showcases his deviation from traditional conservative thought, which often emphasizes the importance of constitutional interpretation. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of Richard Posner's background, ideologies, and unique contributions to law, economics, and judicial thought."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Would you like to be an actor, but aren't the right age or physical type for the part? Don't give up: there may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting.  _ . In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don't see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud. Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours. Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \\"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\\" says Rickey. Later, the recorded words, music, and sound effects are combined with the cartoon art to create the cartoon we enjoy on TV. Sound interesting? Maybe you can have a \\"voice\\" in acting after all!

Constructiveness: A good review should give helpful feedback to the product or service provider, pointing out the strengths and weaknesses. The one-word review \\"Nice\\" does not provide any specific details or information about what exactly was nice or what can be improved. 2. Clarity: A great review should be clear and concise, providing enough information to help others understand the reviewer's perspective. While \\"Nice\\" is brief, it does not reveal much about the reviewer's experience. 3. Helpfulness: Reviews are most useful when they help potential buyers make informed decisions. Unfortunately, the word \\"Nice\\" does not offer any in-depth or practical insights that could guide someone considering the product or service. 4. Subjectivity: A review should ideally balance personal opinion with objective information.

The answer is:","output":"[+] Envision what the experience is like for the other person and what may be driving their actions. Let's say you want to go for a month-long vacation during the summer, but your partner prefers to take smaller vacations throughout the year. This option invites you to empathize with the other person's perspective and consider the reasons behind their preferences. By understanding their motivations, you can find common ground and work towards a compromise that meets both of your needs. In the example given, understanding your partner's desire to take several smaller vacations could lead to a potential solution, such as splitting the month-long vacation into shorter trips spread across the year. The other options are not as comprehensive or actionable in achieving compromise. Option 2 pertains more to the process of negotiation rather than understanding the other person's point-of-view, whereas the focus should be on empathy and understanding. Also, this option incorrectly suggests that you need to gain something from the compromise, rather than finding a solution that works for both parties involved. Option 3 emphasizes the importance of courtesy and politeness, which is indeed necessary in maintaining a positive tone during negotiations. However, it fails to address how to empathize with and understand the other person's stance, which is crucial for compromising effectively. Option 4 discusses being a better judge of someone's situation, but it is rather vague and does not provide clear guidance on how to step into the other person's shoes or how this approach can lead to a successful compromise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Between rent, child care and other necessities, Norton says her expenses cost more than she earns, leaving her without a cushion to fall back on in case of emergencies.      More than three-fourths of Americans don’t have enough money saved to pay their bills for six months, according to survey results released Monday by Bankrate. Half of the survey respondents said they had less than three months’ worth of expenses saved up, and more than one-quarter -- like Norton -- have no reserves to draw on in case of emergency.      Bankrate compared its survey results from this year with results from 2006, and it found that Americans are saving more now than before the recession. However, the results of this year's survey, which was conducted through phone interviews of a nationally representative sample of more than 1,000 adults, indicate that Americans haven't changed their saving habits much over the past three years.      The survey brings into stark relief what many experts have said for some time: While the Great Recession and recovery brought the importance of savings to the forefront -- for everyone, not just the poor -- persistent unemployment and stagnant wages have made it difficult for Americans to put any money away. Low- and middle-income Americans were hit harder by the recession and slow recovery than their wealthy counterparts. The annual wages of the bottom 90 percent of workers declined between 2009 and 2011, according to a January analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. The wages of the top one percent rose 8.2 percent during the same period.      “It’s alarming” how little Americans have saved up, Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate, told The Huffington Post. McBride noted that if Americans want to ensure they're protected in the event of a financial emergency, like a job loss or a medical issue, they should have enough money to cover about six months' worth of bills saved up.      “People have long been woefully under-saved for emergencies,” McBride said. “While they may now realize the importance of emergency savings, they’ve done very little to move the needle.”      With less money to spend on bills and interest rates on savings accounts now at record lows, there's little incentive for most Americans to stash their money away for a rainy day. The disincentive could be part of why nearly half of Americans are one disaster away from a financial emergency, the Corporation for Enterprise Development found earlier this year.      “It’s not like the lesson has been lost on people,” McBride said, “they’ve had a very difficult time making any substantive headway.”      Gevon Lockhart is one of those Americans struggling to put money away, even though she knows the value of savings. Lockhart, 42, said she was able to survive 24 months of unemployment and underemployment thanks to a financial cushion she built up while she was working.      “If I hadn’t saved, my story would've been much worse than it was,” she said.      Though Lockhart knows from personal experience how important keeping money stashed away can be, she’s had trouble building up her savings again, she said. Lockhart works full time at a credit union and skimps on things like eating lunch out, but there still isn't much left after paying all her bills.      “When you’ve depleted the savings that you had before, it becomes a struggle to try to put back,” she said.      Lockhart said she’s not comfortable with the little she’s been able to put away and is concerned she won’t be able to cover her expenses if something “major” happens. Indeed, that’s the case for many Americans, McBride said.      “A lot of people are dealing with stagnant incomes that make it very difficult to ramp up saving,” he said. “Even in the cases where people have managed to squirrel away some money, they don’t really feel good.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A recent survey by Bankrate has revealed that more than three-fourths of Americans do not have enough savings to cover their bills for six months.

Article:And I should know: as Jones is one of the few High Street staples to offer a larger than average range of big sizes, my local branch was the first port of call to accommodate my own size nines. Now it lies empty, the latest instalment in a troubled footwear history that sentenced me to boy's lace-ups at school and overhanging toes in any sandal since. With independent shops rarely stocking shoes above size seven and larger brand outlets offering merely one or two options - if I'm lucky -  finding suitable shoes remains the Holy Grail. Since the 1970s, the average shoe size of men and women in the UK has increased by two sizes, from a size eight to 10 and four to six, respectively, according to research from the College of Podiatry. \\"When size five was average the industry would think providing two sizes above to a seven was just about the fringe of adequate for women, but now that it's a six, we should be seeing far more eights and even nines as standard,\\" says the college's Dr Jill Halstead-Rastrick. She believes the footwear industry is not moving with the times to accommodate a nation that is taller and heavier and so by evolutionary logic, has larger feet, and warns this is an issue that could be a time bomb for the next generation. \\"Increased weight splays the feet and we are seeing a lot of adults wearing shoes that are too narrow or small. This is only going to become more of a problem as we continue to grow in stature - we need a wider variety of larger sizes.\\" It's a familiar narrative to Laura West of the Society of Shoe Fitters. She estimates around 30% of inquiries she receives are from girls aged around 12 unable to find school shoes above a size eight, and who have to wear boys' shoes as a result. Irrespective of any aesthetics this has serious repercussions for girls' foot health, she argues. \\"Boys' shoes will fit differently, and ill-fitting footwear does change [girls] physiology. \\"If feet hurt you shift your weight unnaturally when you walk and this wears out other joints and tendons leading to hip, knee and ankle and neck problems later on.\\" West believes the problem stems from the demise of British manufacturing in the 1980s, when many UK brands shifted production overseas to cut costs. This has meant less research into foot development and a deeper disconnect between the manufacturer and consumer needs, she says. \\"When we produced shoes here we could run short production lines including larger sizes at little extra cost, but in an overseas factory you have to order in far greater numbers, which becomes cost prohibitive. \\"Independent shops can't compete with low cost imports - and they would have been the ones to feedback the inability to supply certain items like larger sizes to their manufacturers' representatives. \\"Now consumers trawl from High Street chain to supermarket and the staff have little involvement; it is a self-service mass market approach and an 'if we've got it you can have it - if not tough' mentality, so manufacturers don't have a clue.\\" A focus on fashion over quality has compounded the problem for many UK women's shoe makers. By contrast the men's market has benefitted from higher-priced items such as Goodyear welted shoes which enjoy a healthy export trade to Europe, Asia and US. \\"The price commanded for them makes UK production profitable,\\" says British Footwear Association chief executive John Saunders. By contrast \\"most UK women's shoemakers were operating in the volume to mid-tier market,\\" he says, and were hit hard in the late 20th Century by increasing Asian competition, retailers demanding a greater share of profits and consumers turning to cheaper shoes. China now accounts for about 65% of shoes made worldwide, and with this production coming from a country where the average female shoe size is a UK three-and-half, this virtual monopoly has hit shoes sizes. Former luxury shoe buyer Naomi Braithwaite, now a fashion marketing and branding lecturer at Nottingham Trent University, recalls how standard sizes of shoes at the company she worked for reduced after it switched production from Italy to China. \\"Sample sizes were based on Chinese feet which are smaller boned and narrower. As well as this, many of the designers at the luxury end simply didn't like to see their shoes in bigger sizes as they didn't think they looked as beautiful as the more petite sizes.\\" The additional cost involved in producing larger sizes to cover the extra material and increased shipment weight is another deterrent for a somewhat already reluctant industry, she concedes. It's a gap in the market that Long Tall Sally, a specialist in fashion and footwear for tall women, has successfully exploited. Its shoe range starts at size seven and goes up to 13. Making shoes above a size eight costs the firm about Â£5 extra a pair because of the extra material, and it also uses a bespoke 'last' - a three-dimensional foot shaped mould on which each shoe is made. Yet it seems to be paying off with footwear growing from a 5% to 15% share of the total business. Size 10 is now its most popular size, representing 30% of footwear sales. \\"Demand for larger size women's shoes has risen steadily,\\" says Long Tall Sally's shoe buyer, Chris O'Shea. The other option if you've larger feet, is to buy German. \\"Germany is very much an exception - it has always had much better selection in larger size footwear and what they do well is shoes with quality, comfort and longevity'\\" says O'Shea. While Germany still outsources production to Asia, many of its footwear brands retain head office, marketing and design in the country - with a consistent focus on function and quality over fashion. It's why Dr Halstead-Rastrick often directs patients to German brands. But she says the industry could better use technology to provide more personalised fittings without the prohibitive prices that handmade shoes usually command. \\"You can even scan and measure feet via a phone app now, so surely we can't be that far off a situation where we can send our measurements to companies and say, this is the shape of my foot can you make me something?\\" Here's hoping change is afoot. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article highlights the issues faced by those with larger feet in finding suitable footwear, particularly in the UK. Since the 1970s, the average shoe size for men and women in the country has increased by two sizes, but the footwear industry has not kept pace with the change. Few shops stock larger sizes, and when they do, the options are often limited. The shift in production overseas has contributed to the problem, as well as a focus on fashion over quality. Foot health experts warn that ill-fitting footwear can lead to long-term health issues. However, some brands, like Long Tall Sally and German footwear companies, are successfully addressing the gap in the market.

Mary sighed, running her fingers nervously through her hair, while Megan leaned in, offering a supportive gaze. \\"You know, I never thought I'd find myself here,\\" Mary admitted. \\"But the more I think about it, the more I realize that Dave and I just aren't the same people we used to be.\\" Megan nodded, understanding that relationships change and evolve over time. \\"It's not easy, Mary, but you're making the right decision. You have to put your own happiness first.\\" Mary smiled half-heartedly at her friend's encouragement. She looked down into her cup, her coffee now lukewarm. \\"I guess I'm just scared, Meg. We've been together since college, and the thought of starting all over again... It's just so daunting.\\" Megan reached over and placed her hand on Mary's arm. \\"I know it is, but this is a chance for you to rediscover who you are and what you want out of life. Remember when you used to paint and visit art galleries before Dave came into your life?\\" Mary's face lit up at the memories. \\"Yes, I really loved doing that. I always felt so inspired and free.\\" \\"Exactly!\\" Megan exclaimed, excited at her friend's enthusiasm. \\"This is the perfect opportunity for you to reconnect with your passions and maybe even find new ones.\\" As the weeks went by, Mary took Megan's advice to heart. She decided to attend an art class at a local community center, where she met a new group of people who shared her love for creativity. Slowly but surely, Mary began to embrace her newfound independence and found joy in the meaningful connections she made in her art community. Megan, on the other hand, couldn't help but feel a tinge of envy when she saw how much her friend was blossoming. Despite being happily married to her husband, Tom, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was living a life stagnant and devoid of excitement. Of course, she loved Tom, and they had a good life together, but seeing Mary thrive made her crave something more. It was during one of their coffee catch-ups that Megan finally shared her feelings with Mary. \\"I love Tom, I really do, but I almost feel trapped in this life we've built together.\\" Mary listened, offering the same supportive gaze Megan had given her weeks before. \\"You know, Meg, it's never too late to find those things that excite you. If there's something missing, you owe it to yourself to explore and rediscover yourself too.\\" Inspired by Mary's transformation, Megan decided to step out of her comfort zone and joined Mary in attending various workshops and community events. Working closely together on a mural project for the city, the two friends experienced a new level of camaraderie and contentment that transcended their previous understanding of friendship. Tom noticed the change in his wife, too. He saw her joy and excitement when she came home after spending time with Mary and her newfound passions. This made him reflect upon his own life and the parts of it that may have been lacking. Tom decided to surround himself with people who could challenge him and help him grow, not just professionally, but personally as well. As the seasons passed and the leaves changed from vibrant reds and oranges to barren branches covered in snow, life took its turns for both Mary and Megan. Through support, encouragement, and taking risks, the two women found themselves living lives that were everything they could have ever hoped for, and more. Mary's divorce was finalized, and while it did bring up a few lingering emotions, she knew she was now on the path meant for her. Megan and Tom strengthened their marriage with new personal growth experiences, as they shared both their newfound passions and continued to nurture their love for each other.

Q:I have a new situation: Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.  But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend started taking statins for his disease? A:","output":"Based on the given situation and background, the friend who started taking statins for his high cholesterol is Ben.

He killed himself when he was only 37, but he left behind him more than 2,000 paintings and drawings, which established his reputation in a way he would never have considered possible. Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853 at Groot Zundert Province of Noord Nrabant in Dutch. He was the son of a clergyman. His first artist impressions were formed as a boy, from his uncle who was an art dealer. The motivation bore early fruit and from the age of 12 the young Vincent was drawing. The interest led to an apprenticeship   in an art dealer's firm, Groupil's, in the Hague. When he was only 20, he was transferred to the firm's London office. In London Van Gogh faced his first major crisis, when he was rejected in love. After that, he turned to religion, expressed disapproval with art-dealing and neglected his work. Groupil transferred him from London to Paris but, when his work was still unsatisfactory, dismissed him in 1876.  The young Van Gogh made religion a consuming interest and during the next few years travelled in Britain, Belgium and Holland, trying to establish himself as a preacher, but without success. In 1880, at the age of 27, he found himself drawn back to art. He had a job as an assistant evangelist  in the mining village of Borinage in Belgium but realized an artist drive which was to motivate him unceasingly until his death 10 years later. Late in 1881, he moved to the Hague and established a relationship with a woman, Christine Hoornik, with whom he lived for a time. He broke with her in 1883, however, and never again established a significant intimate relationship with a woman. In 1886 Van Gogh left Holland forever and travelled via Antwerp to Paris, and to major changes in artistic style. Van Gogh's work became more youthful in Paris. He  lived with his brother, Theo, who managed the modern department of an art dealer's. A new, more animated, painting style emerged and the impressionist tendencies of earlier work weakened somewhat. Van...

He decided to send his mother some roses. He went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. \\"How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?\\" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe he should be happy with carnations . \\"No, I have to have roses,\\" he said, \\"My mom was sick so much last year and I had little time with her. It has to be red roses, 'cause that's her favourite.\\" The florist shook her head. John was touched by the boy, who wanted to get those roses so badly. John looked at the florist and silently mouthed that he would pay for the boy's roses. Then the florist said, \\"Ok, I will give you a dozen red roses for your six dollars.\\" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement. John ordered his own flowers and had the florist be sure that delivery would include a note telling his mother how much he loved her. Then he drove away from the shop. As he waited at the light, he saw the young man crossing the street and enter a park through two huge gates. Suddenly, he realized it wasn't a park. It was a cemetery . The light changed, and John slowly crossed the road, parked his car and got out to follow the boy down the fence. The boy stopped by a small monument and went on his knee. He carefully laid the roses on the ground and cried, \\"Mommy, why didn't I tell you how much I love you?, Jesus, please.

They declare that if more people rode bicycles to work, there would be fewer automobiles in the downtown part of the city and so less dirty air from car engines. For several years this group has been trying to get the city government to help bicycle riders. For example. They want the city to draw special lanes for bicycles only on some of the main streets, because when bicycle riders must use the same lanes as cars, there are accidents. Bike for a Better City feels that if there were special lanes, more people would use bikes. But no bicycle lanes have been drawn. Not everyone thinks it is a good idea-they say it will slow the traffic.

Here is a question about this article: Religious Jews have Minhagim, customs, in addition to Halakha, or religious law, and different interpretations of law. Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations. On certain issues, Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors, and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past. In this sense, \\"Ashkenazic\\" refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry. Reform Judaism, which does not necessarily follow those minhagim, did nonetheless originate among Ashkenazi Jews.

Hoffmann; born Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann; 24 January 1776 - 25 June 1822) was a Prussian Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror, a jurist, composer, music critic, draftsman and caricaturist. His stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach's famous opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero. He is also the author of the novella The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, on which Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker is based. The ballet Coppelia is based on two other stories that Hoffmann wrote, while Schumann's Kreisleriana is based on Hoffmann's character Johannes Kreisler. Hoffmann assimilated well with Polish society; the years spent in Prussian Poland he recognized as the happiest of his life. In Warsaw he found the same atmosphere he had enjoyed in Berlin, renewing his friendship with Zacharias Werner, and meeting his future biographer, a neighbour and fellow jurist called Julius Eduard Itzig (who changed his name to Hitzig after his baptism). Itzig had been a member of the Berlin literary group called the Nordstern, and he gave Hoffmann the works of Novalis, Ludwig Tieck, Achim von Arnim, Clemens Brentano, Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert, Carlo Gozzi, and Calderon. These relatively late introductions marked his work profoundly.  He moved in the circles of August Wilhelm Schlegel, Adelbert von Chamisso, Friedrich de la Motte Fouque, Rahel Levin, and David Ferdinand Koreff.  His fortunate position was not to last: on 28 November 1806, during the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte's troops captured Warsaw, and the Prussian bureaucrats lost their jobs. They divided the contents of the treasury between them and fled. In January 1807 his wife and two-year-old daughter Cacilia returned to Posen, while he pondered whether to move to Vienna or go back to Berlin. A delay of six months was caused by severe illness. Eventually the French authorities demanded that all former officials swear allegiance or leave the country. As they refused to grant him a passport to Vienna, he was forced to return to Berlin. He visited his family in Posen before arriving in Berlin on 18 June 1807, hoping to further his career there as an artist and writer.","output":"This text is about Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann, also commonly abbreviated as E.

He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime.

A major problem is his chief rival Grocer, whose effort to cartelize the hitman business puts him at potentially lethal odds with the unaffiliated Martin. Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in his hometown of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his therapist, Dr. Oatman, and his secretary, Marcella. She books him a contract in Michigan that coincides with the reunion, ostensibly to smooth things over with the client whose contract was botched. Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin reconnects with his friend Paul and seeks out his high school sweetheart Debi Newberry, now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets. Meanwhile, Martin is being stalked by Felix LaPoubelle, who attempts to kill Martin in the convenience store that stands in place of his childhood home. He is also tailed by two National Security Agency agents who were tipped off to Martin's contract by Grocer. Despite these dangers, Martin remains distracted by his desire to make amends with Debi and fails to open the background dossier on his prospective target. At the reunion, Martin mingles with his former classmates, one of whom hands him her toddler. Martin then experiences an epiphany, recognizing that his recent disillusionment with his work and his amends with Debi signify an opportunity to change his life for good. Moments later, while exploring the halls, Martin is attacked by LaPoubelle, whom he kills in self-defense.

One of his biggest jobs so far has designed the hair and makeup for the three Lord o f the Ring movies . He had just six weeks to design and make more than a hundred wigs, each one a different style, color, shape and length. The hair and makeup in a movie are just as important as the costumes or the sets. Over the years, Peter has made actors look older, younger, healthy and sick. For one movie he even made a female actor look like a man! \\"What people don't realize about wigs is that we are not always making people more beautiful,\\" he says. \\"Often we are covering up beauty and making them look ordinary.\\" All Peter's wigs are handmade using human hair, so they look as real as possible. This also makes them very expensive -between US  4,500 and US 12,500 each! He knows he's done a good job when people don't realize the star of the movie is wearing a wig. So he was pleased when one newspaper said that Nicole Kidman had dyed her hair dark brown for a movie. \\"It was a wig and no one knew that9\\" he said.

Please answer the following question: Background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.  Paragraph: Noah is currently making dinner in his kitchen. He has been boiling some soup on the stove for a while, so the temperature of the soup is currently high. Noah's brother, Justin, is sitting on the couch in the living room. Justin is eating ice cream, which has a low temperature.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Do the particles have more kinetic energy in the ice cream or in the soup? Answer:","output":"The particles have more kinetic energy in the soup. This is because the soup has been boiling on the stove for a while, causing its temperature to be high. A higher temperature indicates that the particles of matter in the soup are moving more quickly and have more kinetic energy. On the other hand, the ice cream has a low temperature, meaning its particles are moving more slowly and have less kinetic energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: A couple is sleeping at home.","output":"In the given sentence – \\"A couple is sleeping at home\\" – the most important words are \\"couple,\\" \\"sleeping,\\" and \\"home.\\" Let's break down the significance of each of these words in detail. 1. \\"Couple\\": This word is essential in determining the subject of the sentence. A couple refers to two people who are in a romantic relationship or are married. By incorporating this word in the sentence, we understand that there are two individuals involved in the action taking place. Without this word, we wouldn't know who (or how many people) the sentence refers to. 2. \\"Sleeping\\": Sleeping is the primary action being described in the sentence. It is the central activity that the couple is engaged in, and thus, holds significant importance in understanding the main message of the sentence. Eliminating this word would leave the sentence without a clear purpose or a description of what the couple is doing. 3. \\"Home\\": The word \\"home\\" establishes the location at which the action (sleeping) is occurring. This information adds context to the sentence, helping readers visualize the situation more effectively. Furthermore, it reflects a sense of intimacy, safety, and privacy, as homes are commonly associated with these qualities. Without the word \\"home,\\" the sentence would lack essential information about where the couple is sleeping. In summary, the words \\"couple,\\" \\"sleeping,\\" and \\"home\\" are of utmost importance in conveying the meaning of the given sentence.

Can you tell me the answer to which of the indian language is known as italian of the east??","output":"The Indian language known as the \\"Italian of the East\\" is Telugu. Telugu is a Dravidian language predominantly spoken in the southern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, as well as by Telugu speakers in other Indian states and countries. The reason for this nickname can be traced back to a notable Italian linguist named Niccolò de' Conti. He was an explorer and merchant from the early 15th century who traveled extensively, including visiting India. During his travels, he came across the Telugu language and was captivated by its melodic quality and similarity to the sound of Italian. This led to him referring to the language as the \\"Italian of the East.\\" Another possible reason behind this nickname lies in the structural and phonetic resemblances observed by linguists when comparing the two languages. Both Telugu and Italian are known for their mellifluous rhythms and smooth phonetics, which allows for expressive and harmonious intonation. Apart from the melodic quality, there are a few more reasons that affirm the resemblance between Telugu and Italian: 1. Syllabic structure: Both languages have a similar syllabic structure, which means words usually end in vowels, contributing to the musicality while being spoken. 2. Literary tradition: Telugu has a rich literary heritage dating back several centuries. Its script and language follow distinct patterns and rules, akin to the Italian language. 3. Polysyllabic words: In both Telugu and Italian, there are a variety of polysyllabic words built with compound sounds that produce a rhythmic effect in speech. 4. Grammatical structure and functions: Though the languages belong to different language families, certain syntactic and morphological similarities can be observed in verb conjugations, verb-noun agreement, and usage of gender. All these factors contribute to the comparison between Telugu and Italian, bestowing upon Telugu the title of the \\"Italian of the East.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Melbourne Melbourne is experiencing high population growth, generating high demand for housing. This housing boom has increased house prices and rents, as well as the availability of all types of housing. Subdivision regularly occurs in the outer areas of Melbourne, with numerous developers offering house and land packages. However, after 10 years[when?] of planning policies to encourage medium-density and high-density development in existing areas with greater access to public transport and other services, Melbourne's middle and outer-ring suburbs have seen significant brownfields redevelopment. Q: What is generating high demand for housing in Melbourne?","output":"The high demand for housing in Melbourne is being generated by a combination of factors that include population growth, economic growth, urban development, and changing social trends. Below is a detailed explanation of these factors: 1. Population Growth: Melbourne has experienced significant population growth in recent years, primarily due to natural increase and immigration. This has led to an increase in the number of people seeking accommodation in the city, causing a surge in demand for housing. As people move to Melbourne for better job opportunities, education, or quality of life, the city's population swells, requiring the construction of more housing units to accommodate everyone. 2. Economic Growth: Melbourne boasts a strong and stable economy that has consistently attracted businesses and industries, leading to job creation and an increase in the city's population. A thriving job market draws people to the city in search of employment, which in turn generates demand for housing. Additionally, a robust economy can lead to higher income levels, enabling individuals and families to invest in property or rent better-quality accommodation. 3. Urban Development: Melbourne has been undergoing extensive urban development, including the construction of new transport infrastructure and public amenities. These improvements have increased the city's overall livability and made certain areas more desirable, leading to an increased demand for housing in those regions. Furthermore, government planning policies have encouraged medium-density and high-density development in existing areas with good access to public transport and other services, leading to a surge in housing demand in those neighborhoods. 4. Changing Social Trends: Melbourne has seen a shift in social trends that has affected housing demands. More and more people are choosing to live in urban areas rather than suburban or rural communities, as these areas offer better job opportunities, access to amenities, and diverse lifestyle choices. This has resulted in a higher demand for housing in Melbourne's inner city and surrounding suburbs. Additionally, there has been an increase in the number of single-person households and smaller families, leading to a higher demand for smaller, low-maintenance housing options, such as apartments and townhouses. In conclusion, the high demand for housing in Melbourne can be attributed to its population growth, economic success, urban development, and changing social preferences. All these factors contribute to the rising need for more housing options, with a particular emphasis on medium-density and high-density developments in well-connected, amenity-rich areas. This heightened demand has led to rising house prices and rents, as well as significant brownfields redevelopment in Melbourne's middle and outer-ring suburbs to accommodate the growing population."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There has been a lot of love that has been put into Wes Anderson's \\"Fantastic Mr Fox\\", unfortunately all the love is for himself. Granted, there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self-consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and this is the best that Wes Anderson could come up with. The animation is good in the close-up shots of the animals, however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess. There wasn't really anything special about the acting either, with Wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better. I'm pretty sure George Clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in South Park, one of them where he played a dog. The film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically, despite the film being set in England, all the good animals are typical Americans playing baseball, whilst the bad guys are stereotypical English with the most insulting English accents.

Passage: McVeigh rented a storage space in which he stockpiled seven crates of 18-inch-long (46 cm) Tovex sausages, 80 spools of shock tube, and 500 electric blasting caps, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the 40,000 pounds (18,000 kg) of ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as he did not believe it to be powerful enough (although he did obtain seventeen bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb which was detonated in the desert to avoid detection. Later, speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, \\"You learn how to handle killing in the military. I face the consequences, but you learn to accept it.\\" He compared his actions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, rather than the attack on Pearl Harbor, reasoning it was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost.On April 14, 1995, McVeigh paid for a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas.

Question: Process:  - Dirty dishes are rinsed - Placed into the dishwasher - A detergent is added to the detergent dispenser - The dishwasher is closed - The power is turned on - In about 1.5-2 hours, the dishes are clean -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person may hyperventilate happens, how will it affect HURTING the dishwasher to clean better.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented involves a person potentially hyperventilating. Hyperventilation refers to a state in which a person breathes more rapidly than needed, resulting in a reduced level of carbon dioxide in their blood. It is important to note that hyperventilation is a separate issue unrelated to the dishwasher's operation and does not affect its ability to clean dishes. To address your question, hyperventilating will not have any direct or indirect effect on the dishwasher's cleaning process. Here is a summary of the mentioned steps in the dishwasher process:  1. Dirty dishes are rinsed: This step removes any large food particles and debris before dishes are loaded into the dishwasher. Hyperventilation has no influence on this step. 2. Dishes are placed into the dishwasher: This involves organizing and loading the dishes into the dishwasher racks. Again, hyperventilation does not affect this step. 3. A detergent is added to the detergent dispenser: Adding detergent is crucial for the effective cleaning of dishes. Hyperventilating does not influence the detergent's effectiveness or this step in the process. 4. The dishwasher is closed: This requires simply closing the dishwasher door before starting the cycle. Hyperventilation has no impact on this action. 5. The power is turned on: Turning on the dishwasher initiates the cleaning cycle. Hyperventilation does not influence the dishwasher's electrical supply or operation. 6. In about 1.5-2 hours, the dishes are clean: During the cleaning cycle, the dishwasher uses various systems like water supply, heating elements, and detergent to effectively clean the dishes. Hyperventilation has no bearing on these systems or the cleanliness of dishes. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis concerning hyperventilation does not affect the dishwasher's ability to thoroughly clean dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Virginia pair met 10 years ago while buying lottery tickets—splitting a 2,500 winner—and married earlier this year. But that union—an interracial one in a state that banned such marriages for decades—has instigated a court battle over Hill's estate and could end with the couple splitting up, the AP reports. Hill is legally incapacitated, and a judge has ruled daughter Rebecca Wright shouldn't have facilitated the marriage without the court's permission. Wright's sister, Patricia Barber, claims the union complicates the division of Hill's 475,000 estate, because now Harrison could inherit a portion. \\"She wants to sell my mother's house. She wants the money,\\" Wright tells WUSA9. Should Barber win, Hill would have to move in with her or be put in a nursing home—either way, she and Harrison would be separated. \\"They're not gonna separate us. No, we're not gonna let them,\\" Harrison tells the station. The judge agrees on that score: Breaking them up could \\"create a circumstance in Ms. Hill's life that she doesn't deserve,\\" he ruled. To protect Hill's interests, an attorney has been appointed and her daughters removed as guardians. Wright believes ageism and racism are also at play in her sister's court action, telling WJLA that mindsets haven't changed. But Hill and Harrison don't mind: \\"We see hearts, we don't see color.\\" (This couple got married after 72 years together.)","output":"Title: Love Triumphs Over Adversity: The Heartwarming Story of Edith Hill and Eddie Harrison In an age where true love is hard to find, Edith Hill, 96, and Eddie Harrison, 95, are a shining example of what it means to be completely committed to one another. Meeting 10 years ago while purchasing lottery tickets, the couple struck both luck and love, winning 2,500 and each other's hearts. Earlier this year, the elderly Virginia pair decided to make their love official and tied the knot. Despite their love story's fairy-tale-like beginning, Hill and Harrison, an interracial couple, now face a court battle that could possibly separate them – a bitter outcome in a state that had once banned interracial marriages for decades. Hill is considered legally incapacitated, and her daughter Rebecca Wright's involvement in facilitating the marriage without court permission has sparked a family feud and legal challenge. Wright's sister, Patricia Barber, asserts that the couple's marriage complicates the division of Hill's 475,000 estate, as Harrison now stands to inherit a portion. \\"She wants to sell my mother's house. She wants the money,\\" Wright tells WUSA9. If Barber wins the court battle, Hill would have to move in with her daughter or be put in a nursing home, separating her from her beloved husband, Harrison. Determined to remain united, Harrison says, \\"They're not gonna separate us. No, we're not gonna let them.\\" The judge in their case agrees with their sentiment, stating that breaking them apart could create an undeserving, devastating circumstance in Hill's life. To ensure Hill's best interests are protected, an attorney has been appointed on her behalf, and her daughters have been removed as guardians. Wright believes that ageism and racism are intertwined in the court battle, with outdated mindsets remaining prevalent in society. However, Hill and Harrison, undeterred by the challenges, assert that love transcends all differences, saying, \\"We see hearts, we don't see color.\\" In a world sorely in need of examples of compassion and dedication, their love story is an inspiring reminder of the power of true love."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Our goal is to isolate c. Let's start by getting rid of the -26 from the right side. We do that by adding 26 to both sides of the equation. Adding 26 to both sides will result in: 58 + 26 = 84*c - 26 + 26. Simplifying it leads to: 84 = 84*c. Step 3: Now we need to get the c by itself. We can do that by dividing both sides of the equation by 84. 84 / 84 = 84*c / 84 This simplification leads to: c = 1.

The annual ceremony at which the awards are presented is a major part of the film industry's awards season, which culminates each year in the Academy Awards.  The 74th Golden Globe Awards, honoring the best in film and television in 2016, was broadcast live on January 8, 2017. Jimmy Fallon hosted the show.  In 1943, a group of writers banded together to form the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and by creating a generously distributed award called the Golden Globe Award, they now play a significant role in film marketing. The 1st Golden Globe Awards, honoring the best achievements in 1943 filmmaking, was held in January 1944, at the 20th Century-Fox studios. Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including the Beverly Hills Hotel, and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.

To briefly explain the coal-heating process once again: First, a type of coal is selected and broken down into smaller particles. Then, these particles are mixed with hot air and fed into a boiler. The heat from the coal turns the water inside the boiler into steam, which powers turbine blades. These blades generate electricity through the magnetic charging of wire coils. Following this, the water returns to its chamber, and the process is repeated.

News article: ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A domestic dispute aboard a cruise ship led to the death of a 39-year-old Utah woman, and the FBI is investigating what happened in U.S. waters off Alaska, the agency said Wednesday.      Princess Cruises said the woman died Tuesday night on the Emerald Princess, which was carrying 3,400 passengers and 1,100 crew members on a weeklong trip that left Sunday from Seattle. Company spokeswoman Negin Kamali declined to provide any other details about the case, referring questions to the FBI.      \\"Since the incident, our fleet security team has been coordinating with the FBI and other local authorities,\\" Princess Cruises said in a statement to CBS affiliate KTVA in Anchorage.      FBI spokeswoman Staci Feger-Pellessier said no arrests had yet been made, but a team was heading to Alaska's capital city of Juneau.      CBS News      The ship was diverted to Juneau because of the investigation, arriving nearly five hours ahead of schedule on Wednesday morning, said S. Kirby Day III with the cruise line. Passengers, however, were not immediately allowed to get off the ship, he said.      Passengers were seen taking photos of Gastineau Channel and Juneau from the decks and balconies of the ship.      No further schedule changes were expected for the cruise, which was set to leave late Wednesday and head to the southeast Alaska town of Skagway, Kamali said.      But conversations are underway to offer passengers some compensation for lost time, such as providing credits for shore excursions, she said.      Since the vessel arrived so early, excursions such as glacier viewing or seeing sled dogs were not ready, but Day anticipated allowing people off the ship later in the day.      The FBI said it is required to step in when such deaths occur in international or U.S. waters. ||||| FBI agents responded from the bureau’s Anchorage office to investigate the suspicious death of a 39-year-old woman from Utah who was aboard a cruise ship off Southeast Alaska.      Anchorage FBI spokeswoman Staci Feger-Pellessier said the death, aboard the Emerald Princess near Juneau, was reported to the FBI Wednesday morning.      “It was in water outside of any state’s territory,�? Feger-Pellessier said. “That’s why it’s our jurisdiction.�?      Charles Rowlen tells KTVA he and his wife were in a room, two floors above, where the incident took place Tuesday night.      “It was evening for us, I had turned in and my wife was taking a shower and I heard terrible screaming, I mean you knew it wasn’t normal,” Charles said. “And it sounded like two or three ladies or girls, definitely women screaming.”      Rowlen said his wife looked over the balcony and saw a man, bruised, cut and covered in blood.      “My wife’s a registered nurse, she thought he was going to jump over the rail, and at one point he put his hand on the rail and set his rear on it, but she started yelling get back in and the ship announced, get a security team to that area,” he said.      Rowlen said the yelling got worse.      “There was a lot of yelling started up again between men, fighting you know, somebody hurt somebody’s sister and it was a family dispute,” he said. “At one time, when my wife went to the phone, I yelled down to the young man, I said, ‘don’t worry, there’s help coming, you’ll be okay and we’re praying for ya.'”      At the time, Rowlen says he couldn’t see that a woman lay dead on the deck below.      Chris Ceman was in a room just down the hall.      “One of the little girls from that room came running out, calling for help, that her parents were in a fight,” Ceman said. “She sounded pretty desperate.”      Like most of the other passengers, he didn’t learn of the death until the morning. Both Rowlen and Ceman say they didn’t hear gunshots.      The crime scene aboard the cruise ship had been secured by late Wednesday morning, Feger-Pellessier said, and the FBI sent an evidence response team from Anchorage to Juneau. The identity of the victim, as well as any word on the status of any suspects, wasn’t immediately available.      In a statement, Princess Cruises said that a domestic dispute occurred aboard the Emerald Princess at about 9 p.m. Tuesday “resulting in the death of a 39-year-old female guest from Utah.�?      “Since the incident, our fleet security team has been coordinating with the FBI and other local authorities,�? Princess officials wrote.      By late Wednesday morning, the cruise ship was tied up alongside a Juneau dock. None of the passengers were allowed to debark, however.      Kirby Day, a Princess Cruises employee in Juneau, said the Emerald Princess had been scheduled to arrive in Juneau at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, but its arrival was expedited to 8 a.m. due to the death on board.      Day said passengers would hopefully be released by 2 p.m. to join pre-scheduled tours. However, around 3 o’clock, the Emerald Princess Captain said all Juneau tours have been canceled for passengers on board.      The nearly 5,000 passengers were stuck on board until around 5 p.m. Some say they were frustrated they had missed out on pre-paid excursions in Juneau. But, many others told KTVA the mood on board was somber and people remained calm, despite the wait      The Emerald Princess, on a one-week cruise out of Seattle since July 23, had been scheduled to make a scenic cruise of Tracy Arm Fjord on Wednesday. Princess officials said that excursion had been canceled.      The ship set sail for Skagway at 11:15 p.m.      The FBI has confirmed a suspect in the killing is in custody.

The FBI is investigating the domestic dispute death of a Utah woman on board the ship, which was traveling in U.S.... (Associated Press)      ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A suspect is in custody in the death of a woman during a domestic dispute on a cruise ship in U.S. waters off Alaska, the FBI in Anchorage said late Wednesday.      FBI spokeswoman Staci Feger-Pellessier had no other details ahead of a scheduled Thursday news conference at which the U.S. attorney's office plans to announce charges.      Princess Cruises said the 39-year-old woman died Tuesday night on the Emerald Princess, which was carrying 3,400 passengers and 1,100 crew members on a weeklong trip that left Sunday from Seattle.      Company spokeswoman Negin Kamali declined to provide any other details, including the woman's name, and referred questions to the FBI.      The Emerald Princess was diverted to Juneau because of the investigation, which the Coast Guard was also involved in. The ship arrived in Juneau early Wednesday, and passengers were stuck on board for more than eight hours before they were allowed to disembark. While on board, some scoped out their surroundings with binoculars or took pictures, while others watched the comings-and-goings in the restricted-access area leading to the ship. Some waved to onlookers on shore.      The scene was a bit harried as people got off the boat, trying to figure out if their shore excursion was still on or making alternate sight-seeing plans.      Suzanne Ragsdale, of Houston, said passengers were notified late Tuesday about security issues and told over the public address system Wednesday morning that there had been a death. She said being onboard for so long was \\"awful\\" and that her kids were bored.      Her family had hoped to see Mendenhall Glacier, a popular local destination, and to do some whale watching. She said she was able to rebook a whale watching cruise for Wednesday evening.      \\"I was hoping we'd be cruise people. We may not be after this,\\" she said.      Zane Edwards, who was traveling with his family, said efforts were made to take care of passengers. There were games in the main atrium and movies playing in theaters, he said.      Edwards, of California, said this is his first trip to Alaska, though he's been on other cruises. \\"It's like a mini city. Things are going to happen,\\" he said.      Earlier, several people, including at least one child, were escorted by authorities off the vessel in separate groups. Some were wearing white and gray hooded sweat shirts, with hoods or umbrellas in some cases obscuring their faces.      The groups were whisked away in vehicles with dark-tinted windows that waited in a restricted area of the port.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. David (Maguire) and his twin sister Jennifer (Witherspoon) lead different high-school social lives. Jennifer is shallow and extroverted; David is introverted and spends most of his time watching television. One evening while their mother, Sherry (Jane Kaczmarek), is away, they fight over the TV. Jennifer wants to watch a concert on MTV, but David wants to watch a marathon of Pleasantville, a black and white 1950s sitcom about the idyllic Parker family, who live in the squeaky-clean suburb of Pleasantville, Iowa. During the fight, the remote control breaks, and the TV cannot be turned on manually.A mysterious TV repairman (Knotts) shows up, quizzes David about Pleasantville, then gives him a strange remote control. The repairman leaves, and David and Jennifer resume fighting. However, they are then transported by the remote into the Parkers' black and white Pleasantville living room in 1958. David tries to reason with the repairman (with whom he communicates through the Parkers' television), but he succeeds only in chasing him away. With the remote no longer functioning, David and Jennifer must now pretend they are Bud and Mary Sue Parker, the son and daughter on the show.David and Jennifer witness the wholesome nature of the town, such as a group of firemen who only rescue cats stuck in trees, as there are no fires to fight. David tells Jennifer they must stay in character and not disrupt the lives of the town's citizens, who do not notice any difference between Bud and Mary Sue, and David and Jennifer. To keep the show's plot Jennifer dates a boy from high school, but, due to her impatience, Jennifer skips all forms of storybook romance and has sex with himâa concept unknown to him and everyone else in town.Slowly, Pleasantville begins changing from black and white to color, including flowers and the faces of people who have experienced bursts of emotion and personal transformation (usually through sex). Though against Jennifer's disruption at first, David eventually joins in when he begins to see the shows characters as real people and not just avatars. David introduces Mr. Johnson (Daniels), owner of the cheeseburger joint/soda shop where Bud works, to colorful modern art via a book from the library, sparking in him an interest in painting. Johnson and Betty Parker (Allen) fall in love, causing her to leave home, throwing George Parker (Macy), Bud and Mary Sue's father, into confusion. The only people who remain unchanged are the town's fathers, led by the mayor, Big Bob (Walsh in his final performance), who sees the changes eating at the values of Pleasantville. They resolve to do something about their increasingly independent wives and rebellious children.As the townsfolk become more colorful, a ban on \\"colored\\" people is initiated in public venues. Eventually, a riot is touched off by a nude painting of Betty (painted by Johnson) on the window of Mr. Johnson's soda shop. The soda shop is destroyed, books are burned, and people who are \\"colored\\" are harassed in the street. As a reaction, the town fathers announce rules preventing people from visiting the library, playing loud music, or using paint other than black, white, or gray. In protest, David and Mr. Johnson paint a colorful mural on a brick wall, depicting their world, prompting their arrest. Brought to trial in front of the town, David and Mr. Johnson defend their actions, and their passion begins to influence the non-colored members of the population into becoming colored. David also eventually arouses enough anger and indignation in Big Bob that the mayor becomes colored as well. The mayor runs off, effectively ending the segregation.With Pleasantville and its populace now in full color, Jennifer and David both reflect on how their actions in changing Pleasantville have changed their own views on how they perceive the real world and their place in it, noting that it had been far more difficult for them to become colorful as opposed to the other townsfolk, and the circumstances that eventually allowed them to. Jennifer stays to finish her education, citing that her poor academic record in the real world would not allow for college.

Cronauer is greeted by Private First Class Edward Montesquieu Garlick (Forest Whitaker). Cronauer's irreverence contrasts sharply with many staff members and soon rouses the ire of two of his superiors, Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). Hauk adheres to strict Army guidelines in terms of humor and music programming, while Dickerson is generally abusive to all enlisted men. However, Brigadier General Taylor (Noble Willingham) and the other DJs quickly grow to like the new man and his brand of comedy. Cronauer's show consists of unpredictable humor segments mixed with news updates (vetted by the station censors) and rock and roll records that are frowned upon by his superiors. Cronauer meets Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), a Vietnamese girl, and follows her to an English class. Bribing the teacher to let him take over the job, Cronauer starts instructing the students in the use of American slang. Once class is dismissed, he tries to talk to Trinh but is stopped by her brother Tuan. Instead, Cronauer befriends Tuan and takes him to Jimmy Wah's, the local GI bar, to have drinks with Garlick and the station staff. Two other soldiers, angered at Tuan's presence, initiate a confrontation that Cronauer escalates into a brawl. Dickerson reprimands Cronauer for this incident, but his broadcasts continue as before. While relaxing in Jimmy Wah's one afternoon, he is pulled outside by Tuan, who says that Trinh likes him and wants to see him, moments before the building explodes, killing two soldiers and leaving Cronauer badly shaken.

Your task is to summarize them. Q: ANGELS FYI Tommy Hanson returns to Angels      Pitcher had been dealing with mental issues since the death of his stepbrother.      “I was having mental issues with the death of my younger brother,” said Hanson, 26, two years older than his deceased brother. “I was just trying to get through it. I didn’t know how to handle it.      The Angels were about to fly to Houston. They called him in for a private meeting and told him to stay home, and to take all the time he needed to get well.      Iannetta was not the only teammate to wonder.      Tommy Hanson spent six days away from the Angels — long enough, he thought, to mourn the death of his stepbrother. In his second start after rejoining the team, catcher Chris Iannetta called time out and walked to the mound.      “That was the first time anything like that had ever happened to me. I didn’t know how to cope with it.”      Hanson returned to the Angels’ clubhouse — and to a fair number of hugs — on Tuesday, after three weeks away from the team. He said he spent time in California, with his father and stepmother, working out at UC Irvine and Soka University, until reporting to the Angels’ Arizona training complex last week.      “Physically, I feel great,” he said. “I’m in great shape. I just had to deal with the issues going on in my head.”      Hanson wouldn’t discuss the specifics of how he dealt with those issues.      He said he expects to start Friday but said the final word would come from Angels Manager Mike Scioscia. Jerome Williams, whose turn in the rotation comes up Friday, said before the game that he had not been told of any change in his status.      Scioscia declined to say when Hanson would start but said Joe Blanton would remain in the rotation. Blanton took the loss Tuesday, giving up three runs and seven hits in seven innings. He is 1-8 with a 5.98 earned-run average, and has given up the most hits and taken the most losses of any pitcher in the American League.      “Joe is hopefully turning the corner on his rough start,” Scioscia said. “He’s pitched a strong start for us the last couple outings. We’re going to need him as we move forward.”      Scioscia said after the game that Williams could help in the bullpen for the “next couple days” but would get one more start. It is unlikely the Angels would use a six-man rotation for more than one turn.      “Whatever role settles for Jerome, it will be an important one,” Scioscia said.      Williams has delivered four consecutive quality starts since rejoining the rotation. He is 3-1 with a 3.19 ERA in five starts, with a 1.69 ERA in eight relief appearances.      In order to clear a roster spot to reinstate Hanson, the Angels put left-hander Sean Burnett on the disabled list because of a sore left elbow. Burnett, who previously missed 22 games because of irritation in his left arm, said X-rays were negative and doctors injected him with a lubricant in the hope of fighting inflammation.      “I’m kind of like the Tin Man,” Burnett said. “I was a little squeaky, so they lubed me up.”      Etc.      Outfielder Josh Hamilton was scratched from the lineup after reporting back stiffness during batting practice. Scioscia said he would be evaluated Wednesday. … The Angels plan to activate Jered Weaver on Wednesday.                  bill.shaikin@latimes.com      Twitter: @BillShaikin ||||| Just One More Thing...

Hanson, 29, suffered \\"catastrophic organ failure\\" on Monday, according to WSB-TV in Atlanta, and had been hospitalized since early Sunday morning.      Hanson, a 6-6, 220-pounder known for his amiable personality, last pitched in the major leagues in 2013 with the Los Angeles Angels. He spent nearly a month away from the club that year as he coped with the sudden death of his stepbrother.      He finished third in National League Rookie of the Year voting in 2009, when he won 11 games and posted a 2.89 earned-run average for the Atlanta Braves.      \\"We are incredibly saddened to learn of Tommy's tragic passing,\\" said Braves president John Schuerholz in a statement released by the club. \\"He was a favorite in the clubhouse and with our staff and he will truly be missed by everyone in Braves Country.

While Hanson made 31 starts and won 13 games for the Braves in 2012, they traded him to the Los Angeles Angels that off-season for reliever Jordan Walden. When his stepbrother passed away that spring, Hanson took six days off from the team, made one start, and then realized he needed more time away to mourn.      He returned to the Angels three weeks later.      \\"I was having mental issues with the death of my younger brother,” Hanson, then 26, told reporters then. \\"I was just trying to get through it.

In another attempt at a comeback, he signed with the Chicago White Sox in April 2014 and spent the season in the minors before an injury cut his season short. He was granted his free agency after the season.      In May, Hanson signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants and appeared for their Class A and AAA teams in San Jose and San Francisco.      In five major league seasons, four with the Braves, Hanson went 49-35 with a 3.80 ERA.

I read this background article the other day: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures.  I am facing a new situation today: Alexander is conducting reactions in his college chemistry class. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses a high strength burner so the temperature of the reaction is high. In the second reaction, reaction B, he uses a weaker model of burner, so the temperature of the reaction is low.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which reaction will proceed slower? A:","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, the reaction that will proceed slower is Reaction B. This is because it uses a weaker model of burner, resulting in a lower temperature for the reaction.

Question: Information:  - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event.  - Geir Andersen ( born February 12 , 1964 ) is a Norwegian nordic combined skier who competed from 1983 to 1989 . He won three medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships with one gold ( 1984 : 3 x 10 km team ) and two silvers ( 1985 : 15 km individual , 3 x 10 km team ) . Andersen also finished 10th in the individual event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo . He had six individual victories in his career from 1984 to 1985 .  - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing.  - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen.  - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate.  - The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women. Championship events include nordic skiing's three disciplines: cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and nordic combined (the latter being a combination sport consisting of both cross-country and ski jumping). From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held every year, including the Winter Olympics. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years.  - Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing.  - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia.

Question: Information:  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Waders are birds commonly found along shorelines and mudflats that wade in order to forage for food (such as insects or crustaceans) in the mud or sand. They are called shorebirds in North America (where \\"wader\\" is used to refer to long-legged wading birds such as storks and herons). Waders are members of the order Charadriiformes, which includes gulls, auks and their allies.  - The coursers are a group of birds which together with the pratincoles make up the family Glareolidae. They have long legs, short wings and long pointed bills which curve downwards. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they inhabit deserts and similar arid regions.  - Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills. They belong to the family Ciconiidae. They are the only family in the order Ciconiiformes, which was once much larger and held a number of families.  - Glareolidae is a family of birds in the wader suborder Charadri . It contains two distinct groups , the pratincoles and the coursers . The coursers include the atypical Egyptian plover , Pluvianus aegyptius , which has sometimes been placed in its own family . The family contains 17 species in five genera .  - Charadriiformes is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most Charadriiformes live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), some occupy deserts and a few are found in thick forest.  - Mudflats or mud flats, also known as tidal flats, are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by tides or rivers. They are found in sheltered areas such as bays, bayous, lagoons, and estuaries. Mudflats may be viewed geologically as exposed layers of bay mud, resulting from deposition of estuarine silts, clays and marine animal detritus. Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the intertidal zone, and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily.  - The Egyptian plover (\\"Pluvianus aegyptius\\"), also known as the crocodile bird, is a wader, the only member of the genus \\"Pluvianus\\". Formerly placed in the pratincole and courser family, Glareolidae, it is now regarded as the sole member of its own monotypic family Pluvianidae.  - Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes \\"Tomistoma\\", is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes \\"Tomistoma\\", the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.  - The herons are the long-legged freshwater and coastal birds in the family Ardeidae, with 64 recognised species, some of which are referred to as \\"egrets\\" or \\"bitterns\\" rather than herons. Members of the genera \\"Botaurus\\" and \\"Ixobrychus\\" are referred to as \\"bitterns\\", and, together with the zigzag heron or zigzag bittern in the monotypic genus \\"Zebrilus\\", form a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae. Egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative plumes. Although egrets have the same build as herons, they tend to be smaller. Herons, by evolutionary adaptation, have long beaks.  - An auk or alcid is a bird of the family Alcidae in the order Charadriiformes. The alcid family includes the murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and murrelets.  - The pratincoles or greywaders are a group of birds which together with the coursers and Egyptian plover make up the family Glareolidae. They have short legs, very long pointed wings and long forked tails.  - Gulls, often referred to as seagulls, are seabirds of the family Laridae in the suborder Lari. They are most closely related to the terns (family Sternidae) and only distantly related to auks, skimmers, and more distantly to the waders. Until the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus \\"Larus\\", but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of several genera. An older name for gulls is mew, cognate with German \\"Möwe\\", Danish \\"måge\\", Dutch \\"meeuw\\", and French \\"mouette\\"; this term can still be found in certain regional dialects.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'parent taxon' with the subject 'glareolidae'.

In the scheme of hierarchical biological classification known as taxonomic rank, the level of 'order' is a higher rank than 'family.' Therefore, in relation to the family Glareolidae, the order Charadriiformes is a 'parent taxon'.

Maury was a descendant of the Maury family, a prominent Virginia family of Huguenot ancestry that can be traced back to 15th-century France. His grandfather (the Reverend James Maury) was an inspiring teacher to a future US president, Thomas Jefferson. Maury also had Dutch-American ancestry from the \\"Minor\\" family of early Virginia.  He was born in 1806 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg; his parents were Richard Maury and Diane Minor Maury. The family moved to Franklin, Tennessee, when he was five. He wanted to emulate the naval career of his older brother, Flag Lieutenant John Minor Maury, who, however, caught yellow fever after fighting pirates as an officer in the US Navy. As a result of John's painful death, Matthew's father, Richard, forbade him from joining the Navy. Maury strongly considered attending West Point to get a better education than the Navy could offer at that time, but instead, he obtained a naval appointment through the influence of Tennessee Representative Sam Houston, a family friend, in 1825, at the age of 19.  Maury joined the Navy as a midshipman on board the frigate Brandywine which was carrying the Marquis de La Fayette home to France, following La Fayette's famous visit to the United States. Almost immediately, Maury began to study the seas and to record methods of navigation.

The leaf should be free of obstructions, such as plumb lines. (II) However, if the leaf stays open, it is not hard enough to get paint to stick to the table and ruin the look.

Input: The film explores several flashbacks and present timelines to show how Dean and Cindy became involved. Dean is a young high school dropout, working for a moving company in Brooklyn. Cindy is a pre-med student living with her constantly fighting parents and also caring for her grandmother in Pennsylvania. Cindy and Dean meet at Cindy's grandmother's nursing home while Dean is delivering a new resident's furniture and they begin dating afterwards.Cindy discovers she is pregnant, and tells Dean that the baby is most likely not his, as her ex-boyfriend Bobby didn't use protection. Dean asks Cindy whether or not she wants to keep the baby. At an abortion clinic, Cindy decides at the last moment to cancel the procedure, and on a bus ride home, Dean tells her he doesn't mind if the child is not his, and that he wants to begin a family with her. Before the wedding, Bobby finds out about Dean, and beats him up.Five years later, the couple lives in rural Pennsylvania with their daughter Frankie. Dean works at painting houses while Cindy is a nurse at a clinic. One evening, Dean insists on taking Cindy out for a romantic getaway at a motel so they can have some time off from their preoccupied lives, much to Cindy's reluctance.While buying wine in a liquor store, Cindy sees Bobby, who asks Cindy if she has ever cheated on her husband. She hesitates, but eventually says no. In the car, Cindy and Dean get into an argument when she mentions seeing Bobby again. At the motel, they continue fighting during sex. Cindy is called away early in the morning to work at the clinic, and she leaves a note for Dean. At the clinic, Cindy's boss, Dr. Feinberg, talks to her about a position he had offered her, and asks if she would move closer to work, suggesting that they would be able to spend time together on weekends. Visibly upset, Cindy says she previously thought he was offering her the position because she was good at her job.Angered that Cindy left the motel without waking him, Dean shows up drunk at the clinic, leading to a violent altercation with Dr. Feinberg. Cindy says she wants a divorce after Dr. Feinberg fires her. After leaving the clinic, Dean tries to persuade Cindy to give the marriage another chance, asking if she wants their daughter to grow up in a broken home. Cindy says she does not want Frankie to grow up with parents who are so hateful to each other.Dean reminds Cindy of their wedding vows, and the two apologize to each other.

The complete sentence reads:  Dennis loved to paint but William preferred crayons since they left no mess, so William bought only crayons. A detailed reason for choosing the second option: The sentence outlines the preferences of two characters, Dennis and William. Dennis enjoys painting, while William has a preference for crayons. The sentence emphasizes the reason behind William's preference, which is that crayons leave no mess as compared to paint. This reason further supports the conclusion that William would choose to buy crayons, as it aligns with his personal preferences and the advantages he sees in using them. Option (i), \\"Dennis bought only crayons,\\" doesn't follow the logic set forth in the sentence.

The Commission president said he was ‘not the type who trembles in front of prime ministers’ and warned Mr Cameron that he had ‘a problem’ with other EU leaders. Mr Juncker’s remarks come as Mr Cameron battles to reduce the £1.7billion surcharge demanded by the EU to cover years of strong economic growth in the UK while Europe struggled.

Roger Federer (German pronunciation: ['rodZ@r 'fe:d@r@r]; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 2 in men's singles tennis by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). He is regarded by many fans, players and analysts as the greatest tennis player of all time. Federer has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles--the most in history for a male player--and has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record total of 308 weeks, including 237 consecutive weeks. After turning professional in 1998, he was continuously ranked in the top ten from October 2002 to November 2016. The 2006 season was statistically the best season of Federer's career. In November 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as statistically the second-best season of all time during the Open Era, behind Rod Laver's Grand Slam year of 1969.  Federer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player since John McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92-5 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982). Federer reached the finals in an astounding 16 of the 17 tournaments he entered during the season.  In 2006, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and reached the final of the other, with the only loss coming against Nadal in the French Open. This was Federer and Nadal's first meeting in a Grand Slam final. He was the first man to reach all four finals in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. Federer defeated Nadal in the Wimbledon Championships final. In the Australian Open, Federer defeated Marcos Baghdatis, and at the US Open, Federer defeated Roddick (2003 champion). In addition, Federer made it to six ATP Masters Series 1000 finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Federer, however, consistently pushed Nadal to the limit on clay throughout the season taking him to fourth-set tiebreakers in Monte-Carlo and Paris, and a thrilling match in Rome that went to a deciding fifth-set tiebreaker.  Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world No. 1. Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old Andy Murray in the second round of the 2006 Cincinnati Masters, in what would be Federer's only defeat before reaching the final of a tournament that year. Federer finished the season on a 29-match winning streak, as well as winning 48 of his last 49 matches after the French Open.  A personal highlight for Federer came near the end of the season when he won his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland for the first time, having finished runners up in 2000 and 2001, and missing the tournament in 2004 and 2005 due to injuries. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Why was the 2006 season an outstanding year?","output":"The 2006 season was an outstanding year for Roger Federer because he won 12 singles titles, had a match record of 92-5, reached the finals in 16 of the 17 tournaments he entered, and won three Grand Slam singles titles.

Who played the role of Ashley Wilkes in Gone With The Wind????","output":"The character of Ashley Wilkes in the iconic 1939 film, Gone with the Wind, was portrayed by British actor Leslie Howard. Born on April 3, 1893, in London, England, Leslie Howard Steiner achieved significant success not only as a film actor but also as a stage actor, producer, and director. Although his involvement with the theater started at a young age, he didn't become a professional actor until he was in his early 20s. He made his first stage appearance in 1917, and gradually, his stage career gained momentum, leading to his on-screen debut in the 1920 silent film, The Heroine of Mons. As his career progressed, Leslie transitioned to \\"talkies\\" (films with sound) and appeared in several critically acclaimed films such as The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), Pygmalion (1938), and Intermezzo (1939). Before playing Ashley Wilkes in Gone with the Wind, Leslie was already an established actor in both the British and American film industries. Despite some initial hesitance to accept the role due to concerns that it would typecast him, Howard's portrayal of the refined and honorable Southern gentleman Ashley Wilkes ultimately became one of his most memorable roles.  In addition to his acting career, Leslie Howard was actively involved in supporting the British war effort during World War II. Tragically, on June 1, 1943, he died at the age of 50 when the civilian plane he was traveling on was shot down by the German Luftwaffe over the Bay of Biscay. Despite his untimely death, Leslie Howard's contribution to the film industry and his memorable portrayal of Ashley Wilkes in Gone with the Wind continue to be celebrated today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then he studied Earth's radiations, which he labeled as rad B. He also learned that longer wavelength radiations would produce heat.  Would rad B more likely or less likely make atmosphere warmer than rad A? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's first understand the main characteristics of the Sun's radiations (rad A) and Earth's radiations (rad B) and how they contribute to the warming of the atmosphere. It's important to note that both rad A and rad B play critical roles in determining the Earth's temperature and climate. Rad A represents solar radiation emitted by the Sun. The Sun's radiation primarily consists of short-wavelength radiations, such as ultraviolet (UV), visible, and some near-infrared (NIR) light. These radiations travel through space and reach Earth's atmosphere. Approximately one-third of incoming solar radiation is reflected back into space by the atmosphere, clouds, and Earth's surface, while the rest is absorbed by the planet. As Earth absorbs solar radiation, it heats up and emits its own radiation in the form of terrestrial radiation or rad B. Rad B comprises long-wavelength radiations, such as mid-infrared and far-infrared, also known as thermal infrared. Rad B is emitted in all directions, including back towards the surface and atmosphere, and also towards space. The greenhouse effect plays a crucial role in the warming of the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, and nitrous oxide, present in the atmosphere, can absorb a portion of rad B. When these gases absorb rad B, they become excited and then re-emit the energy in the form of radiation, some of which is directed back at the Earth's surface. This process effectively traps heat within the atmosphere, keeping our planet warm and habitable. Now, back to the original question: would rad B more likely or less likely make the atmosphere warmer than rad A? In terms of their direct warming effect, it can be concluded that rad B is more likely to make the atmosphere warmer than rad A. This is because rad B, with longer wavelengths, corresponds to the heat-emitting thermal infrared radiation. This radiation is absorbed and re-emitted by GHGs, intensifying the greenhouse effect and subsequently warming the Earth's atmosphere. Both rad A and rad B are critical to Earth's energy balance and climate system. It is important to understand that while rad A provides the initial energy input to the Earth, it is predominantly rad B that contributes to the warming of the atmosphere through the greenhouse effect. Therefore, a better understanding of these two types of radiation, their interactions with the atmosphere, and how they contribute to the climate system, is essential for our knowledge of the Earth's overall energy balance."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Space Tourism and SpaceX: The concept of space tourism has attracted public attention for decades, with wealthy individuals investing in limited and costly opportunities to experience life beyond our atmosphere. With SpaceX's successful track record in lowering the cost of space exploration, the company is on track to revolutionize the space tourism industry. This landmark lunar mission highlights SpaceX’s expansion into the realm of space tourism, which began with the company’s initial announcement of sending tourists to the ISS via the Crew Dragon spacecraft. As this field continues to develop, many are eagerly awaiting the day when space travel becomes as common as traditional commercial aviation. The Lunar Mission: The two anonymous tourists have secured an opportunity to travel around the moon with SpaceX. While the company has not yet revealed the exact cost of the trip, it is assumed to be a substantial investment. The lunar expedition is expected to take place once SpaceX has completed a series of successful tests, such as the Crew Dragon's first crewed flight to the ISS. Previous SpaceX lunar mission efforts include the initial plan disclosed in 2018 to send Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and several artists in the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) on a week-long trip around the moon in 2023. The success of the imminent two-tourist lunar voyage could help pave the way for this larger and more elaborate lunar mission. Significance and Future Implications: This moon mission featuring two tourists represents a significant step forward for SpaceX and the space tourism industry as a whole. If the mission proves successful, it can open doors for an influx of space tourism endeavors, attracting more private investment and launching a new era of exploration, innovation, and travel beyond Earth’s atmosphere. Ultimately, this lunar mission signifies a major shift in the way space travel is perceived and made accessible to the general public. As SpaceX continues to revolutionize space exploration and tourism, we can expect to see greater advances in technology, economies of scale, and an increase in the frequency of extraterrestrial expeditions and lunar missions. Conclusion: As SpaceX embarks on this groundbreaking journey to send two tourists around the moon, the company is poised to shift the paradigm of space travel, creating new opportunities and forging a path toward accessible and affordable cosmic exploration. The lunar mission is not just an impressive feat for SpaceX, but also serves as a testament to human curiosity, determination, and the undying pursuit to explore the depths of the universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I've been here a couple times mainly because I didn't feel like cooking my own protein meal/making a juice/shake. I've had their Teriyaki Bowl with quinoa and their Muscle Burger as a lettuce wrap. It actually looks like they've changed their menu since I've last been here... they don't have juices anymore but I've had a juice that was called like the Hang Over Cure or something... and some other juice that tasted a bit better than whatever was in the hang over one.  The Teriyaki bowl was okay. The salmon was a bit dry. The bowl could have used more sauce/flavor. I was really hungry when I was eating it and rushing over to a photo shoot though, so I wasn't exactly sitting and enjoying the meal, moreso shoveling it into my mouth.  The muscle burger as a lettuce wrap was impossible to eat as a lettuce wrap. I had to take my knife and fork to it. And there definitely wasn't enough lettuce or onions. Really just a ton of meat and cheese. And it definitely wasn't cooked medium. I only got this because the owner, at least I'm assuming the owner, recommended it. I barely put a dent into this monster when my stomach decided it wanted nothing more to do with it.

Alexander II's death caused a great setback for the reform movement. One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or Duma, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his father's death was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, Nicholas II, commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\" With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory.

Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft.

It consisted of Auschwitz I (the original camp), Auschwitz IIBirkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp), Auschwitz IIIMonowitz (a labor camp to staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps.  - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889  30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The German extermination camps or death camps were designed and built by Nazi Germany during World War II (193945) to systematically kill millions of Jews, Slavs and others whom the Nazis considered \\"Untermenschen\\", primarily by gassing, but also in mass executions and through extreme work under starvation conditions.  - Franciszek Piper ( born 1941 ) is a Polish scholar , historian and author . Most of his work concerns the Holocaust , especially the history of the Auschwitz concentration camp . Dr. Piper is credited as one of the historians who helped establish a more accurate number of victims of Auschwitz - Birkenau death camps . According to his research , at least 1.1 million people perished at Auschwitz - Birkenau , of whom about 960,000 were Jewish . He is the author of several books and chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz - Birkenau State Museum .  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Following the Invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II, nearly a quarter of the entire territory of the Second Polish Republic was annexed by Nazi Germany and placed directly under the German civil administration. The rest of Nazi occupied Poland was renamed as the General Government district. The annexation was part of the \\"fourth\\" partition of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, outlined months before the invasion, in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.  - Nazi Germany maintained concentration camps (KZ or KL) throughout the territories it controlled before and during the Second World War. The first Nazi camps were erected in Germany in March 1933 immediately after Hitler became Chancellor and his Nazi Party was given control over the police through Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick and Prussian Acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring. Used to hold and torture political opponents and union organizers, the camps initially held around 45,000 prisoners.    What is the relationship between 'franciszek piper' and 'poland'?

A CT scan revealed nothing but cerebrospinal fluid where the \\"little brain,\\" which contains around half the brain's neurons, was supposed to be, reports the New Scientist. The woman had sought medical help after experiencing a month of vomiting; she also noted she has always walked unsteadily. She has slightly slurred speech, and her mother told doctors she hadn't started walking until age 7 or speaking intelligibly until around age 6. The woman, who is married with a daughter, has no history of neurological problems in her family, researchers write in the journal Brain. Only eight other people have ever been found to have the condition, known as cerebellar agenesis, but most other cases involved infants with severe mental impairment and were discovered upon autopsy, the researchers say. This case \\"shows that the young brain tends to be much more flexible or adaptable to abnormalities,\\" a professor of neurosurgery at New York's North Shore University Hospital tells LiveScience, which notes that even a damaged cerebellum can cause severe motor challenges. \\"When a person is born with an abnormality ... the rest of the brain tries to reconnect and to compensate for that loss or absence.\\" (But as adaptable as the brain is, it's a myth that we only use 10% of it.)","output":"Title: The Curious Case of a Woman Living Without a Cerebellum: Revealing the Brain's Adaptability Introduction: The human brain is a complex and fascinating organ, responsible for controlling our every thought, movement, and interaction with the world around us. One of the essential parts of the brain, the cerebellum, plays a critical role in maintaining balance, coordination, and fine movement control. In a rare and fascinating case, doctors in China discovered a 24-year-old woman living a relatively normal life without this vital part of her brain. This unusual medical case sheds light on the adaptability and resilience of the human brain when faced with abnormalities. Background: The cerebellum, often referred to as the \\"little brain,\\" contains about half of the brain's neurons and is positioned at the back of the skull, beneath the cerebrum. Its primary function is to assist in controlling voluntary movements, balance, and coordination. In an extraordinary case reported in the journal Brain, researchers detailed the life of a 24-year-old woman who, despite lacking this crucial part of her brain, has managed to live a relatively normal life. Case presentation: The woman had sought medical help after experiencing a month of vomiting; she also noted she has always walked unsteadily. Upon conducting a computed tomography (CT) scan, doctors discovered that the cerebellum was missing from her brain. Instead, the space where the cerebellum should have been was filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, the woman has a slightly slurred speech, and her mother informed doctors that she had only started walking at the age of 7 and speaking intelligibly around the age of 6. Interestingly, despite lacking the cerebellum, this woman is married, has a daughter, and possesses no family history of neurological problems. Cerebellar Agenesis: This woman's condition, known as cerebellar agenesis, is extremely rare. Until now, only eight other individuals have ever been found to have this condition. However, most other cases involved infants with severe mental impairment, and the missing cerebellum was discovered upon autopsy. This case provides an intriguing insight into the adaptability of the human brain when faced with abnormalities from a young age. The Brain's adaptability: A professor of neurosurgery at New York's North Shore University Hospital spoke with LiveScience about the case, concluding that the young brain is much more flexible and adaptable than previously thought. In cases such as this, where individuals are born with an abnormality, the rest of the brain works to reconnect and compensate for the loss or absence of normal function. This demonstrates that even in the face of significant developmental challenges, the brain possesses an incredible capacity for adaptation. Conclusion: This rare and exceptional case of a woman living without a cerebellum highlights the incredible adaptability of the human brain. Despite the importance of the cerebellum in controlling movement and coordination, this woman has managed to lead a relatively normal life, showcasing the brain's remarkable ability to rewire itself and compensate for abnormalities. The resilience and flexibility of the human brain continue to amaze scientists and medical professionals, providing hope for advancements in understanding and treating neurological disorders."},{"instruction":"Joern Renzenbrink (born 17 July 1972) is a former professional tennis player from Germany.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please briefly summarize this news article: The New York Times Fielding recognizable heroes with clear vulnerabilities (from amnesia to inexperience to a daughter in jeopardy), all three advanced their narratives while remaining true to their protagonist’s previously defined character. This is the essential challenge of a sequel: creating a hero who evolves without abandoning his nature. “Spider-Man 3” tried — and failed — to distract from this by substituting villains for ideas. And “Ocean’s 13” perpetuated a formula of stagnant antihero plus interchangeable crimes, locations and dames. At first glance “The Bourne Ultimatum” — basically an extended chase sequence interspersed with flashbacks and bureaucratic chicanery — appears to value sensation over evolution. A blur of movement, it may leave you jangling, but the director, Paul Greengrass (who also directed “The Bourne Supremacy”), isn’t offering just a series of empty thrills. Continuing a process begun by Doug Liman’s excellent first installment, “The Bourne Identity,” he reduces Matt Damon’s Jason Bourne to a mass of nerve endings and conditioned responses. It’s evolution in reverse. Most action heroes function on a formulaic blend of ego and id, but the “Bourne” films are about the effacement of the self and the erasure of identity. We can’t know Bourne because he doesn’t know himself, so the accomplishment of this trilogy — and of Mr. Damon’s performance — lies in its ability to involve us in the quest of a hero who is often more machine than man. His particular tragedy is that self-knowledge won’t set him free; it will only imprison him more. All he can do is run until, in the movie’s final and most peaceful shot, Mr. Greengrass brings him, and the trilogy, full circle. Yet while Bourne is becoming less of a man, the opposite is happening to Harry Potter. In “The Order of the Phoenix” the maturation of the wizard (paralleled by a rapidly maturing Daniel Radcliffe) has darkened the palette and emotional landscape. It’s time for Harry to put away childish things, and aside from the cat pictures beloved of the movie’s newest villain, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), cuteness is in short supply. What remains constant, though, is the series’s commitment to community and the way it serves as a counterweight to human frailty. Unlike Bourne, Harry is not self-sufficient; and while Bourne’s journey has stripped him of all extraneous emotion, Harry may have become more of a mess. In this universe information is power, and friends are indispensable; David Yates, the latest director to come on board, understands this. That’s why Harry’s confusion at being cold-shouldered by Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is one of the film’s more painful, and essential, threads. For John McClane (Bruce Willis), the reluctant hero of “Live Free or Die Hard,” personal growth is for sissies. The world — and its villains — may change around him, but McClane remains, in the words of his latest nemesis, “a Timex watch in a digital age.” And that’s exactly how we like him. After 12 years in franchise limbo “Live Free or Die Hard” entered theaters with significantly longer odds than its competitors. Lacking the literary pedigree and gluteal definition of his more youthful rivals, McClane was the most shopworn and least flexible of the bunch. But timing is everything. The fourth “Die Hard” offered a hi-tech terrorist, a bungling Homeland Security and a villain foolish enough to mess with McClane’s 401(k). Now it’s personal. Tapping into boomer fears of computer malfunction and financial disaster, “Live Free or Die Hard” united at least two generations in modern angst and popcorn bliss. Much credit belongs to Mr. Willis, who hews to his tempered character with the long-suffering resignation of Brad Pitt when presented with yet another set of adoption papers. When trouble appears, McClane sucks in his breath and his gut, rolls his eyes and saddles up. So when the next “Die Hard” sequel calls, we will show up for him, if only because he always shows up for us. Summary:","output":"\\"The Bourne Ultimatum,\\" \\"The Order of the Phoenix,\\" and \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" each manage to advance their respective sequel storylines while staying true to their protagonists' natures. In \\"The Bourne Ultimatum,\\" Jason Bourne's character is reduced to raw nerve endings and conditioned responses, which contrasts with Harry Potter's maturation in \\"The Order of the Phoenix.\\" The \\"Die Hard\\" franchise maintains its classic formula with John McClane as a reluctant and unchanged hero in \\"Live Free or Die Hard.\\" Each film successfully builds on the evolution of its hero and engages the audience in their individual quests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Famines in Bangladesh, the Sahel and Ethiopia seemed to prove Malthus finally right. Population growth was outstripping food supplies, food prices skyrocketed: people like Paul Ehrlich warned of a \\"population bomb\\". Yet, the apocalypse did not happen. Agricultural productivity growth not only fed more people, but also accommodated a resource guzzling boom in meat consumption. If skeptics pointed to inequalities and persisting hunger, the neoliberal orthodoxy would tell them to be patient until trickle-down effects would have worked their magic. African agriculture key If it has ever worked, it does so no more. The number of chronically hungry people has hovered around one billion for more than a decade. Large swathes of the developing world, including Africa, have seen a worrying decoupling from the trend of long-term economic growth. The reasons for this botched agricultural revolution are many but they seem to apply not just to","output":"Africa, but also to other parts of the developing world where agriculture has struggled to keep pace with the rapidly escalating demands for food. Some of the primary factors contributing to this dilemma include inadequate investments in agricultural research and development, outdated farming practices, lack of access to modern technology, unreliable infrastructure, land degradation, climate change, and socio-economic and political challenges. Furthermore, these problems are exacerbated by a growing urbanization trend that reduces the available workforce for agricultural activities, as well as the persisting inequalities in access to resources and markets, which disproportionately affect smallholder farmers. One of the most pressing issues facing Africa and other developing regions is the need to modernize their agricultural sectors. There is a pressing need for the adoption of new and innovative farming practices that increase productivity, promote sustainability and resilience to climate change, reduce post-harvest losses, and make agriculture more profitable for farmers. This can be achieved through targeted investments in agricultural research and development, as well as by providing farmers with access to modern tools, technologies, and knowledge, such as improved seeds, fertilizers, irrigation systems, and other agro-inputs. In addition to modernizing the agricultural sector, a concerted effort must be made to address the underlying socio-economic and political factors that contribute to food insecurity and underdevelopment in these regions. Land tenure policies, which determine the access to and control over land resources, must be reformed to ensure a more equitable distribution of land ownership and use, and to encourage responsible land management practices. Access to credit, especially for smallholder farmers, must be made a priority as this would enable them to access the necessary inputs and technologies to improve their farming practices and potentially increase their profitability. Strengthening the agricultural value chain is also crucial in boosting agricultural productivity and profitability. Investments in transport, storage, and processing infrastructure, as well as the development of agri-food and marketing systems, would help to reduce post-harvest losses, encourage value addition, and increase the bargaining power of farmers. In turn, this would contribute to enhanced food security, improved nutrition, and poverty reduction. Governments, international organizations, and the private sector have a pivotal role to play in addressing these challenges. Concerted efforts must be made to increase public and private investments in agriculture, including through innovative financing mechanisms such as blended finance, risk-sharing instruments, and public-private partnerships. Efforts should also be directed at improving human capital development, through targeted investments in education, healthcare, and social protection, in order to build a skilled and healthy workforce that can drive the agricultural transformation process. In summary, the potential for agricultural growth and development in Africa and other developing regions is immense, but it is hampered by a myriad of complex challenges that require coordinated and sustained action by all stakeholders. Ensuring a successful agricultural revolution will hinge on addressing the multifaceted issues that affect the sector, taking into account the unique socio-economic and environmental contexts in which they occur. Only then can we hope to see a significant reduction in global hunger and a true realization of the shared prosperity that comes with sustainable and inclusive growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My name is Harpreet Arora and I am a representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) International Accounting Standards (IAS) team. I am writing to share some crucial information regarding upcoming changes in accounting regulations and their potential impact on your organization. First and foremost, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has recently issued new amendments to IAS 1. The major update includes the introduction of specific disclosure requirements for liabilities that arise from financing activities. These liabilities are an essential part of a company's financial performance and must be carefully scrutinized and presented in financial statements. As we understand the significance of complying with these regulations, we want to ensure your organization is well-prepared and proactive in adopting these changes. Below are some key points to consider: 1. Familiarize yourself with the amendments: It is imperative to thoroughly understand the amendments and the rationale behind the changes. IASB has provided a detailed explanation of the amendments, including the disclosure requirements for financing activities and the presentation of financial statements. 2. Assess the impact on your organization: Ascertain which financing activities your organization is involved in, and evaluate how the amendments will affect them. This will assist in developing a plan to incorporate these changes into your financial statements and reporting processes. 3. Update internal policies and procedures: Ensure your accounting policies align with the new amendments and that your financial staff is well-trained in following them. Make necessary adjustments to internal documentation, templates, and financial software to accommodate the reporting requirements. 4. Engage stakeholders: It is crucial to communicate with stakeholders (e.g. board members, shareholders, auditors) about the changes and their impact on the financial statements. Collaboration with relevant parties can facilitate a smooth transition and avoid potential misunderstandings. 5. Seek professional guidance: Consulting experts, like those at PwC, can provide tailored advice on implementing the changes and interpreting the requirements correctly. We are here to help your organization navigate this transition with minimal disruption to your operations. At PwC, our mission is not only to ensure compliance with accounting standards, but also to empower your organization by providing the tools and information necessary for financial success. We urge you to consider the implications of these amendments carefully and take the required steps to prepare for implementation. If you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me at harpreet.arora@pwc.com or +(country code and phone number).

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The marsupial embryo is nourished inside the uterus with food from a yolk sac instead of through a placenta. The yolk sac stores enough food for the short period of time the embryo remains in the uterus. After the embryo is born, it moves into the mother’s pouch, where it clings to a nipple. It remains inside the pouch for several months while it continues to grow and develop. Even after the offspring is big enough to leave the pouch, it may often return to the pouch for warmth and nourishment ( Figure below ).

Write an article that answers the following question: how many yards did boswell nail?","output":"Title: The Impact of Chris Boswell: Measuring Success in Yards In an era of increasingly competitive football, the importance of a proficient kicker cannot be overstated. When it comes to the most reliable legs in the game, Chris Boswell undoubtedly comes to mind. Since joining the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2015, Boswell has consistently made game-changing contributions on the field. But, just how many yards has Boswell really nailed throughout his career? In this article, we'll delve into Boswell's performances and analyze his contributions in yards, both on and off the field. Born on March 16, 1991, Christopher Boswell had always exhibited remarkable skill as a kicker. Kicking at Fossil Ridge High School in Keller, Texas, Boswell would eventually go on to kick for Rice University. It was during his tenure in college that Boswell would perfect his craft, developing into the clutch kicker that he is today.  Undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft, Boswell would eventually find a home in the ranks of the black and yellow. His arrival would drastically improve the stability of a previously shaky special teams unit. From 2015 through the 2020 season, Boswell has consistently displayed his ability to make difficult kicks under pressure. Let's break down Boswell's remarkable yardage over the years. 2015 Season: Boswell was called upon to join the Pittsburgh Steelers midseason, replacing the struggling Josh Scobee. In just 12 games, Boswell made 29 of his 32 attempted field goals, with a long of 51 yards. This season, he made a total of 1,184 yards worth of field goals and extra points. 2016 Season: During his first full season, Boswell would continue to demonstrate his prowess. Connecting on 21 of 25 field goals with a long of 49 yards, Boswell would go on to make 1,110 yards in the campaign. 2017 Season: This would prove to be a banner year for Boswell, as he would make 35 of his 38 attempted field goals, setting the record for most field goals by a kicker in a single-season for the Steelers. With a long of 53 yards, Boswell’s 2017 contributions amounted to 1,464 yards. 2018 Season: The 2018 season would prove to be slightly more challenging for Boswell. However, despite a dip in his overall field goal percentage, he would still contribute a respectable 647 yards to the Steelers' cause. 2019 Season: In a season cut short by injury, Boswell only played in 12 games. Even with limited playing time, he managed to make 29 of 31 field goals, with a long of 51 yards. In total, Boswell made 933 yards in a shortened 2019 season. 2020 Season: Last season, Boswell returned to a hero-like form as he connected on 19 out of 20 field goal attempts, with a career-long of 59 yards. In 2020, he amassed 991 yards. Adding up these impressive yardage contributions, Chris Boswell has nailed a staggering 6,329 yards through field goals and extra points across his six-season career with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Of course, it's crucial to mention that his impact on games cannot merely be measured by traditional statistics. His ability to stay composed under pressure and make high-stakes kicks has not only helped secure victories but has also boosted the morale of the entire team. In conclusion, Chris Boswell's career has been nothing short of exceptional thus far, having nailed a significant 6,329 yards as a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers. As we eagerly await the next chapters in Boswell’s career, suffice it to say, the exciting tale of the 'Wizard of Boz' has only just begun."},{"instruction":"In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

He enjoyed spending his days surrounded by family, taking up chores around the house and cultivating the small piece of land that his forefathers had left him. Life was idyllic - beautiful sunsets, freshly minted cups of morning chai, and a close-knit community made up of colorful characters that brought a local flavor to the village. From Ranga's farmer grandfather to his witty, gossipy aunty, every member of the family played a crucial role in keeping their home happy and thriving. Ranga's days were filled with laughter and heartwarming banter that punctuated the family's daily chores. His chores were simple – milking the cows every morning, fetching water from the nearby well, and tending to their small but abundant vegetable garden. However, like a dark cloud creeping over their little paradise, life took an unexpected turn when local dons – Konda Reddy and Lala Goud – arrived in the village, buying up large swaths of land at ‘bargain’ prices. What seemed like a blessing soon turned into a curse, as the dons began to use the villages' property as their personal playground. The once peaceful village life became fraught with tension, with the villagers petrified of satisfying the dons' whims lest they face their wrath. Amid this turmoil, a soft-spoken, withdrawn man named Vasu arrived at Ranga's doorstep. He had traveled from a nearby village and knew the air of danger that preceded Konda Reddy and Lala Goud. Fearing for the safety of his family, Vasu urged Ranga to relocate his home and seek refuge away from the villains' reach. Ranga knew of the risks by ignoring Vasu's warning but didn’t want to uproot his family from their beloved home. As fate would have it, not all encounters with the dons were terrifying. Ranga's life took an unexpected turn when he happened upon a lovely and strong-willed young woman, Anitha, the sister of Lala Goud. It was love at first sight, and amidst the treacherous realities they faced, an unlikely romance bloomed between them. Initially, Ranga hesitated considering the precarious situation surrounding their families; nevertheless, as the days passed, their love grew deeper. However, just as Ranga and Anitha's bond started to bring them closer to their dreams, the situation in the village took another turn. It was discovered that Konda Reddy's sister, Roja, had eloped with Lala Goud. The news of their forbidden love affair angered the villagers and ignited a fierce rivalry between their two powerful families. Konda Reddy, feeling betrayed by Lala Goud, rallied his forces and launched an all-out manhunt for the newly eloped couple. Lala Goud, on the other hand, fortified his defenses, protecting his love-struck sister and his newfound brother-in-law from his sworn enemy. The once-peaceful village now bore witness to a vicious war for power and retribution between Konda Reddy and Lala Goud, which threatened to destroy the innocent lives caught in the crossfire. Recognizing the graveness of the situation, Ranga's sense of duty came to the fore, guiding him to take a stand against the violent feud staining his village's peace. With Anitha by his side, Ranga and his family joined forces with other villagers, determined to fight back against the tyranny and crime the dons had imposed upon them. Together, Ranga and his fellow villagers leveraged their knowledge of the land and superior numbers to conduct clandestine strikes and raids. As a result, they managed to weaken the might of the two dominant crime lords. The villagers, with Ranga at the helm, demonstrated the power of love, unity, and conviction against the darkness that had threatened to engulf their peaceful existence. The rains washed away the stains of this great strife, and the village eventually regained its serene beauty. Life returned to normal for Ranga and his family, who continued to live happily among their patch of vegetables and their feisty, lovable cows. What had started as a fierce storm of conflict and violence between the mighty dons had been resolved through the sheer determination and intelligence of the villagers. With the love story of Ranga and Anitha serving as a beacon of hope for the future, the villagers left the fierceness of their war-torn past behind. They had proved that together, even a small band of humble villagers was capable of taking a stand against the giants who threatened their existence. The happiness and strength that had once defined village life flourished once again, leaving no trace of the pain and darkness that had preceded it. And with Ranga and Anitha joined in marriage, their bond personified the spirit of love and resilience that had brought their community back from the brink."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given an input list A.

Mark Lavon \\"Levon\\" Helm (May 26, 1940 - April 19, 2012) was an American musician and actor who achieved fame as the drummer and one of the vocalists for The Band. Helm was known for his deeply soulful, country-accented voice, multi-instrumental ability, and creative drumming style, highlighted on many of the Band's recordings, such as \\"The Weight\\", \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\", and \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\". Helm also had a successful career as a film actor, appearing as Loretta Lynn's father in Coal Miner's Daughter, as Chuck Yeager's friend and colleague Captain Jack Ridley in The Right Stuff, and as a Tennessee firearms expert in Shooter. In 1998, Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer, which caused him to lose his singing voice. Born in Elaine, Arkansas, Helm grew up in Turkey Scratch, a hamlet of Marvell, Arkansas. His parents, Nell and Diamond Helm, were cotton farmers and great lovers of music. They encouraged their children to play and sing at a young age. Young Lavon (as he was christened) began playing the guitar at the age of eight and also played drums during his formative years. He saw Bill Monroe and His Blue Grass Boys at the age of six and decided then to become a musician.  Arkansas in the 1940s and 50s stood at the confluence of a variety of musical styles--blues, country and R&B--that, when merged, later became known as rock and roll. Helm was influenced by all these styles, which he heard on the Grand Ole Opry on radio station WSM and R&B on radio station WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee. He also saw traveling shows such as F.S. Walcott's Rabbit's Foot Minstrels that featured top African-American artists of the time.  Another early influence on Helm was the work of the harmonica player, guitarist and singer Sonny Boy Williamson II, who played blues and early rhythm and blues on the King Biscuit Time radio show on KFFA in Helena and performed regularly in Marvell with blues guitarist Robert Lockwood, Jr. In his 1993 autobiography, This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band, Helm describes watching Williamson's drummer, James \\"Peck\\" Curtis, intently during a live performance in the early 1950s and later imitating this R&B drumming style. Helm established his first band, the Jungle Bush Beaters, while in high school.  Helm also witnessed some of the earliest performances by southern country music, blues and rockabilly artists such as Elvis Presley, Conway Twitty, Bo Diddley and fellow Arkansan Ronnie Hawkins. At age 17, Helm began playing in clubs and bars around Helena.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did Helm do after high school?","output":"After high school, Levon Helm started playing in clubs and bars around Helena at the age of 17. As mentioned earlier, he established his first band, the Jungle Bush Beaters, while in high school and witnessed early performances by various southern country, blues, and rockabilly artists."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  Now, I have a new situation: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.  Answer this question please: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan? The answer to this question is:","output":"The number of animals is more likely to increase under Milly's plan. Milly's focus on decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere demonstrates a commitment to tackling climate change and mitigating the adverse effects of global warming on the environment and wildlife. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions can help slow down the rate of global warming, which in turn leads to a more stable and suitable climate for various ecosystems and their respective animal populations. In particular, it will help to preserve natural habitats that are currently at risk due to climate change, such as polar ice caps and coral reefs. By preserving and potentially restoring these habitats, at-risk species have a greater chance of survival and, consequently, their populations may increase. Moreover, Milly's plan to decrease greenhouse gas emissions indicates a recognition of the interconnectedness that exists between human activities and the environment, including the impact that anthropogenic gases have on ecosystems and wildlife. By advocating for the reduction of such emissions, Milly is acknowledging the need to address the root causes of the decline in animal populations and adopt a more sustainable approach to development, resource management, and environmental conservation. It is essential to note that while reducing emissions can certainly contribute to a healthier environment and potentially increasing animal populations, it is only one part of a larger effort that would be necessary for restoring and protecting the planet's biodiversity. Additional measures, such as habitat restoration, conservation efforts, and sustainable development practices, must also be implemented alongside Milly's plan for emission reduction in order to maximize the potential for reversing the negative trends observed in our environment and animal populations. Overall, Milly's plan to decrease greenhouse gas emissions reflects a more environmentally-conscious approach and offers a greater likelihood of promoting a healthier planet where animal populations may increase, compared to Jessica's plan to emit more anthropogenic gases, which would exacerbate climate change and further endanger the ecosystem and its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The later edition also changes the date of the events: the first edition sets the story in the 17th century; the 1830 edition sets it in the reign of Queen Anne, after the 1707 Acts of Union which joined Scotland and England. The story is the basis for Donizetti's 1835 opera \\"Lucia di Lammermoor\\".  - A Legend of Montrose is an historical novel by Sir Walter Scott , set in Scotland in the 1640s during the Civil War .

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In contemporary wartime San Francisco, chemist and blackmailer Albert Baker is killed by hit man Philip Raven, who recovers a stolen chemical formula. Raven is double-crossed by his employer, Willard Gates who pays him with marked bills and reports them to the Los Angeles Police Department as stolen from his company, Nitro Chemical Corporation of Los Angeles. Raven learns of the setup and decides to get revenge. LAPD detective lieutenant Michael Crane, who is vacationing in San Francisco to visit his girlfriend, nightclub singer Ellen Graham, is immediately assigned the case. He goes after Raven, but the assassin eludes him. Meanwhile, Gates hires Ellen to work in his LA nightclub after an audition where she sings and performs magic tricks. Then she is taken to a clandestine meeting with Senator Burnett, where she learns that Gates and Nitro Chemical are under investigation as suspected traitors, and is recruited to spy on Gates. Unknown to each other, she and Gates board a train for Los Angeles, followed by Raven. By chance, Raven and Ellen sit next to each other. The next morning, Gates is alarmed when he sees them asleep with Raven's head on her shoulder. He wires ahead to alert the police, but Raven forces Ellen at gunpoint to help him elude them again. He is about to kill her but is interrupted by workmen, allowing Ellen to flee. From Gates's club, she tries to contact Crane, but he has left San Francisco to return to LA.

Article: Many cultures have different ideas about why people catch colds. For example in the United States, some people think that you can catch a cold if your feet get cold. So, mothers tell small children to wear warm boots in the winter. In other places, including parts of the Middle East, some people believe that strong winds cause colds. So, on trains and buses, people usually don't like to sit next to open windows. In parts of Europe, some people think that wearing wet clothes will give you a cold.

Here is a goal: to deconstruct an old pair of underwear. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To deconstruct an old pair of underwear, we can explore various methods and factors that influence the process. Consideration of both practicality and purpose plays a crucial role in determining the most sensible approach. I will outline two different ways to deconstruct an old pair of underwear and evaluate their merits.  1. Manual Cutting and Separation: This method focuses primarily on disassembling the old underwear piece by piece, using tools such as fabric scissors, seam rippers, and tweezers. Here's a detailed plan for this approach: a. Careful Inspection: Begin by thoroughly examining the underwear's construction to identify the different fabric sections and seams. This enables you to grasp the connections between the elements and the order in which they should be disassembled. b. Disassemble the Waistband: Cut around the waistband to separate it from the main fabric. If a separate elastic is used in the waistband, carefully remove it as well. Keep in mind that the waistband might have a label containing care instructions or material composition—remove it if necessary. c. Dismantle Seams: Use a seam ripper to disconnect the different fabric pieces, such as the front and back panels. Be cautious while undoing the stitches to avoid damaging the fabric. d. Detach Any Additional Components: Inspect the underwear for other elements like elastic leg openings or a gusset. Carefully remove these pieces using either scissors or a seam ripper. e. Sorting and Storing Materials: After dismantling the underwear, sort the various materials, such as fabric pieces or elastics, depending on the intended usage or recycling. This method is advantageous in terms of accessing the individual components and potentially repurposing them for other sewing or crafting projects. It might also be the easiest approach for those with limited tools or technical skills. 2. Chemical Deconstruction: This approach involves breaking down the underwear using chemicals, specifically focusing on dissolving the fabric fibers. It's a more complex method and requires a cautious approach. Here's the outline: a. Safety Precautions: Always wear proper safety gear, such as gloves, goggles, and aprons, before handling any chemicals. Work in a well-ventilated area and have a neutralizing agent on hand in case of accidents. b. Fiber Identification: Determine the fabric composition of the underwear. Common materials like cotton, polyester, and nylon will have specific chemical treatments. c. Chemical Selection: Research and procure the appropriate chemicals to break down the identified fibers. Examples include sodium hydroxide for cotton and dimethylformamide for nylon. d. Preparation: Cut the underwear into smaller pieces, making it easier for the chemicals to penetrate the fibers. This also makes the process more manageable. e. Treatment Process: Soak the fabric pieces in the selected chemical solution, following safety guidelines and the recommended time frame to dissolve the fibers. f. Neutralizing and Disposal: After the treatment process, neutralize the chemical reaction with the appropriate neutralizing agent. Properly dispose of the remnants, adhering to local environmental regulations. This method may not be ideal for those without proper knowledge and access to necessary chemicals. However, it may be appropriate for specialized recycling facilities or research purposes. In conclusion, considering the accessibility, safety, and intended usage, the manual cutting and separation method seems to make more sense for deconstructing an old pair of underwear. This approach allows reusing and repurposing individual components and requires minimal equipment and expertise. The chemical deconstruction method, while potentially more effective in breaking down the underwear, poses safety risks and might not be feasible in most cases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have a math problem that looks like this: -129*a - 3723 + 2519 = 43*a First, we need to combine the numbers without letters (called constants). So, we'll add 2519 and subtract 3723: 2519 - 3723 = -1204 Now our equation looks like this: -129*a - 1204 = 43*a Our next goal is to get all the a's (that's the letter with numbers) on one side. So, we'll add 129*a to both sides: -129*a + 129*a - 1204 = 43*a + 129*a That simplifies to: -1204 = 172*a Now we need to find what number a is. To do this, we'll divide both sides by 172: -1204 / 172 = 172*a / 172 The result is: a = -7 That's our answer! a equals -7.

Additionally, the reviewer complains about the price of the food, noting that it is \\"so expensive.\\" This indicates that they do not believe they are receiving good value for their money. Their dissatisfaction with the food extends to the quality and composition of the dishes they ordered, as demonstrated by their reference to a \\"burrito full of rice\\" that has minimal other ingredients.

By questioning the percentage of organic foods used by the restaurant (1% or 99%?), they convey doubt in the authenticity of the establishment's commitment to providing healthier options. This part of the review furthers the overall negative sentiment by insinuating that the restaurant might be misleading customers. Lastly, the reviewer's suggestion to opt for a \\"less expensive fast food place\\" implies that they believe they would have had a better experience elsewhere, even at a lower-priced establishment.

They form significant minorities in Macedonia and Slovenia. There is a large Serb diaspora in Western Europe, and outside Europe there are significant communities in North America and Australia.  The Serbs share many cultural traits with the rest of the peoples of Southeast Europe. They are predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christians by religion. The Serbian language is official in Serbia, co-official in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is spoken by the plurality in Montenegro.  The modern identity of Serbs is rooted in Eastern Orthodoxy and traditions. In the 19th century, the Serbian national identity was manifested, with awareness of history and tradition, medieval heritage, cultural unity, despite living under different empires. Three elements, together with the legacy of the Nemanjić dynasty, were crucial in forging identity and preservation during foreign domination: the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Serbian language, and Kosovo Myth. When the Principality of Serbia gained independence from the Ottoman Empire, Orthodoxy became crucial in defining the national identity, instead of language which was shared by other South Slavs (Croats and Bosniaks).

One day he decided to get the sweetest mango from the very top of the tree. Mangoes which are exposed to the sun the most are the sweetest. So he climbed up to the top, where the branches were thin. He managed to pick up a few sweet reddish fruits, but, in an attempt to climb down, he slipped and started falling towards the ground. Fortunately, he caught the branch as he was falling and remained helplessly hanging on the tree. Then he started to call nearby villagers for help. They immediately came with a ladder and sticks, but could do little to help him. Then after some time one calm and thoughtful person arrived - a well-known sage who lived in a simple hut nearby. People were very curious to see what he would do, as he was famous in solving many people's problems in the area and sometimes very complicated ones. He was silent for a minute and then picked up a stone and threw it at the hanging man. Everybody was surprised. The hanging mango lover started to shout: What are you doing?! Are you crazy? Do you want me to break my neck?\\"  The sage was silent. Then he took another stone and threw it at the man. The man was very angry: \\"If I could just come down, I would show you!\\" That's what everybody wanted - that he came down. But how? Now everybody was tense, as to what would happen next! Some wanted to chastise the sage, but they didn't. The sage picked another stone and threw it again at the man, even more forcefully. Now the man on the tree was enraged and developed a great determination to come down and take revenge.  He then used all his skill and strength and somehow reached the branches which were safe to start going down. And he made it! Everybody was amazed. However, the rescued man found the sage gone.

Options: - cabinet - a mortuary - bookstore - school building - bedroom  Explain why a human would choose \\"cabinet\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"cabinet\\" as the answer to the question above because it is the most suitable option among the given choices. In this context, an enclosed shelf refers to a furniture piece or storage unit with one or more compartments, typically enclosed by a door or doors, where items can be stored and organized. Below, I will explain why the other options are less likely to be chosen and why the cabinet is the most appropriate answer: 1. Cabinet: A cabinet is a piece of furniture specifically designed with enclosed compartments or shelves for the purpose of storing various household items, office supplies, or other objects. It has doors to provide a level of protection and privacy for the items being stored inside. Cabinets come in various shapes and styles, and are commonly used in kitchens, offices, and living spaces. They serve multiple functions and are known for their versatility, making \\"cabinet\\" the ideal answer to the question. 2. Mortuary: A mortuary, also known as a morgue, is a place where deceased bodies are stored until they are claimed by family members or sent for cremation or burial. While there might be shelves or storage units within a mortuary for the purpose of storing bodies or associated supplies, enclosed shelves would not typically be central to its primary function. Therefore, this option is less likely to be chosen by a human. 3. Bookstore: A bookstore primarily consists of bookshelves or display stands designed to showcase books for sale. Although some bookstores may have cabinets with enclosed shelves for specific purposes, such as storing valuable or rare books, this is not the common association with bookstores. The main focus of a bookstore is the open, accessible display of books, so selecting \\"bookstore\\" as the answer to this question would not be the most fitting choice. 4. School building: A school building is a structure that houses multiple classrooms, offices, and other facilities required for the educational process. Enclosed shelves might be present in several rooms or areas of a school building, such as a teacher's cabinet in a classroom or storage units in an office. However, the primary function of a school building is education, and enclosed shelves are not a primary or defining feature; thus, choosing \\"school building\\" as the answer would not be the most accurate selection. 5. Bedroom: Although a bedroom may contain various types of furniture, including cabinets or wardrobes with enclosed shelves, a bedroom's primary purpose is to provide a comfortable space where a person can rest, sleep, and relax. Enclosed shelves or cabinets are a secondary element of a bedroom, and they are not an essential or defining feature of the space. Therefore, \\"bedroom\\" would not be the most precise answer to the question. In conclusion, a human would select \\"cabinet\\" as the answer to this question because it is the most appropriate and relevant choice based on the context. The other options provided either do not have a primary focus on enclosed shelves or do not commonly feature such storage elements as part of their primary purpose. As a result, \\"cabinet\\" stands as the most accurate and reasonable choice for the given question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Physical laws of light make it impossible to view structures smaller than 200 nanometers - the smallest size of bacteria - using a normal microscope alone. But scientists from Bangor and Oxford universities found the silk lets them see beyond the current magnification. The discovery was hailed as \\"exciting\\". Bangor University said extending the limit of the classical microscope's resolution had been the \\"Holy Grail\\" of microscopy for over a century and superlenses had been the goal since the turn of the millennium. Manufactured superlenses have previously been used but this is believed to be the first time a naturally occurring biological material had been used to create one. The team found applying the dragline silk of a golden silk orb-weaver spider to the material being viewed provided an additional two to three times magnification. This allowed them to view structures previously classed as \\"invisible\\", including some germs and viruses. The findings have been published in a paper in the nanoscience research journal Nano Letters. Dr Zengbo Wang, who led Bangor's team, said producing manufactured superlenses involved some complex engineering processes and finding a natural superlens was important \\"so that everyone can access superlenses\\". Prof Fritz Vollrath, whose silk group at Oxford University's department of zoology collaborated on the project, said it was \\"very exciting\\". \\"These lenses could be used for seeing and viewing previously 'invisible' structures, including engineered nano-structures and biological micro-structures as well as, potentially, native germs and viruses,\\" he said. \\"In much the same was as when you look through a cylindrical glass or bottle, the clearest image only runs along the narrow strip directly opposite your line of vision, or resting on the surface being viewed, the single filament provides a one-dimensional viewing image along its length.\\" The golden silk orb-weaver spider - often called Nephila or banana spiders - are known for the impressive webs they weave and are found in warmer regions around the world.

The setting is the fictitious Protestant village of Eichwald, Germany, from July 1913 to 9 August 1914, where the local pastor, the doctor and the baron rule the roost over the area's women, children and peasant farmers. The puritanical pastor leads confirmation classes and gives his pubescent children a guilty conscience over apparently small transgressions. He has them wear white ribbons as a reminder of the innocence and purity from which they have strayed. When his son confesses to impure touching, the pastor has the boyâs hands tied to his bed frame each night. The doctor, a widower, treats the village children kindly but humiliates his housekeeper (the local midwife) and is found with his teenage daughter at night. The baron, who is the lord of the manor, underwrites harvest festivities for the villagers, many of them his farm workers. He summarily dismisses Eva for no apparent reason yet defends the integrity of a farmer whose son has destroyed the baron's field of cabbages. The schoolteacher's friendship with Eva leads to an invitation to her family home during a Christmas break, and they receive permission from her parents to marry after a one-year engagement.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who wrote about the first use of the magnetized compass needle?, using the article: The most important nautical innovation of the Song period seems to have been the introduction of the magnetic mariner's compass, which permitted accurate navigation on the open sea regardless of the weather. The magnetized compass needle – known in Chinese as the \\"south-pointing needle\\" – was first described by Shen Kuo in his 1088 Dream Pool Essays and first mentioned in active use by sailors in Zhu Yu's 1119 Pingzhou Table Talks. There were other considerable advancements in hydraulic engineering and nautical technology during the Song dynasty. The 10th-century invention of the pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal, which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges. There was the Song-era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships. If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water. The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal-like structure. Stern-mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship. In the Song period, the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in a wider range of water depths. The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction.

Prime Minister David Cameron said the delay was \\"extremely frustrating\\", while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said it was \\"incomprehensible\\". Sir John also faces questioning on the delays by a committee of MPs. Conservative MP Sir Richard Ottaway, chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote to Sir John on Tuesday night - before the latest development - asking him to explain why his report had been delayed. Sir Richard said there could be \\"no justification whatsoever\\" for the process taking so long. In a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, Sir John said \\"very substantial progress\\" had been made since his last update, but said the process of allowing people criticised to respond was still taking place. He could give \\"no accurate estimate\\" of a completion date but that it would take \\"some further months\\". In his response, Mr Cameron said he would have liked the report to have been published already and criticised the previous government for not establishing it earlier. The inquiry began its work in 2009 and held its last public hearing in 2011. It has been looking into the reasons for the UK's involvement in the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and the aftermath of the conflict, which saw UK troops remain in Iraq until 2009. During Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Mr Cameron said it was \\"extremely frustrating\\" that the report had not yet been published, but it would not be right for him to interfere with the independent inquiry. He believed there was \\"no mystery\\" in the reasons for the delay and attacked Labour leader Ed Miliband, who he said had opposed the establishment of an inquiry when the idea had been previously put forward by the Conservatives. Mr Miliband said the inquiry had been established six years ago, after combat operations ended, adding: \\"My views on Iraq are well known, and I want to see the inquiry published.\\" Mr Clegg said the public would assume the delay was caused by those criticised in the report attempting to \\"sex it down\\". \\"The public have waited long enough and will find it incomprehensible that the report is not being published more rapidly than the open-ended timetable you have now set out,\\" he said. Although the inquiry has never publicly set a deadline for publication, it has been plagued by delays with lengthy wrangling over what documents can be included in the final report. Nick Robinson, BBC political editor Delayed again. Until after the election. Very suspicious say those who fear a cover up of the decisions taken by Tony Blair's government which led the UK to join George W Bush's invasion of Iraq. Nick Clegg - whose Liberal Democrat party opposed the war in the face of combined Labour and Conservative support for it - says that some will fear that the report of the Iraq Inquiry is being \\"sexed down\\". Few if any of those facing criticism in the report will speak publicly but I've been speaking to those familiar with what's going on behind the scenes. Read more from Nick The inquiry reached an agreement last summer with the UK government in which it would be allowed to refer to the \\"gist\\" of conversations and private correspondence between former Prime Minister Tony Blair and former US President George W Bush. Conservative former Attorney General Dominic Grieve told BBC News Sir John should explain the \\"sequencing\\" of the process to reassure MPs and the public. SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said he was \\"deeply frustrated and incredibly disappointed\\" by the delay, while UKIP deputy chairwoman Suzanne Evans said it \\"reeks of a joint establishment cover-up\\". She added: \\"This was a war that was waged in our name, using our money, and we deserve to know the answers.\\" Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said he was \\"shocked\\" at the delay, saying publication was taking an \\"inordinate\\" amount of time. But his shadow cabinet colleague Rachel Reeves said politicians should not set \\"arbitrary deadlines and targets\\" for publication. \\"We asked Sir John Chilcot to do the inquiry, I think that people have faith in him to do that independently - and we must wait until he judges that he has all the information to make the right verdict and to publish his report,\\" she added. Rose Gentle, whose soldier son Gordon was killed in Iraq in 2004, said families were \\"really frustrated\\" at the drawn-out process. She added: \\"We just feel constantly let down. We can't get over something like this until we find out.\\" Mr Blair, one of more than 100 witnesses to have appeared before the inquiry, has insisted he is not responsible for the delays and wants the report to be made public as soon as possible. Former Lib Dem Home Office minister Norman Baker said a backbench debate on the inquiry would still go ahead on Thursday next week.

Title: Flatland Movie plot: The film opens in a two dimensional world called Flatland populated by living squares, triangles, lines and other polygons. It is three days until the celebration of the year 3000. A Square, attorney at law, struggles to instruct his grand daughter, A Hexagon, in the art of sight recognition. The lesson is interrupted by his brother B Squares arrival. As clerk to President Circle, B Square wants to warn his big brother to stay home that afternoon while there is a meeting at the Senate of the Great Southern Republic of Flatland.The Senate session has been called to discuss the increasing hostilities between the Chromatist movement and the government. Senator Chromatistes is the irregular polygon who leads this rebellious movement that wants to legalize the right of Flatlanders to color their sides as they see fit. Traditionally a taboo practice, the laws were previously relaxed somewhat which emboldened the Chromatists to demand legalization against the will of the majority. The Great Southern Republic distinguishes itself from its enemy, the Northern Kingdom, by its stances on Chromatism and Irregulars along with a democratic government. Relaxing the laws has already been perceived as weakness by the Northern Kingdom who are massing on the borders.Unable to heed his brothers advice, A Square meets with his new client, the first female charged as a Chromatist and on his way home finds himself embroiled in the melee issuing forth from the Senate. President Circles soldiers have assassinated Senator Chromatistes along with his supporters thus sparking a riot that has spilled into the streets of the city.

Possible A: mug, refrigerator, teapot, internet cafe, cupboard  Why is \\"cupboard\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Cupboard\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it represents the most appropriate and typical location for storing teabags among the given options. Based on general everyday knowledge and experiences, people commonly store teabags in a cupboard to keep them dry, organized, and easily accessible. Let's examine the other options to see why they don't align with human common sense for storing teabags: 1. Mug: While you may sometimes find a teabag inside a mug for immediate use, it's an unlikely long-term storage location. Teabags need to be kept in a dry location to maintain their freshness and quality, and storing them in a mug for an extended period can expose them to potential moisture, damage, or contamination. 2. Refrigerator: Storing teabags in a refrigerator is not a common practice, as they can easily absorb moisture, odors, and flavors from the surrounding environment, which can lead to reduced quality or spoilage. It's more important to store them in a cool, dry place like a cupboard or pantry, away from sources of heat, light, and moisture. 3. Teapot: A teapot is a vessel primarily used for brewing or serving tea, not for storing teabags. Storing teabags in a teapot can also expose them to moisture, damage, or contamination, similar to a mug. 4. Internet cafe: An internet cafe is an establishment where customers can use computers to access the Internet, usually for a fee, and find refreshments such as coffee, tea, or snacks. While one might be able to purchase or request a teabag at an internet cafe, it's an entirely unrelated context to Sean's situation, and not a place where he would be storing his teabags after purchasing groceries.

Article: Eyelid glue (also known as “putti”) and eyelid tape are popular cosmetic items that help create a “second eyelid” for those who have mono-eyelids. Both the liquid adhesive and the tape are effective, though the tape may need modification to achieve a perfect fit. Eyelid tape comes in a few varieties, including rolls and “pre-cut” shapes. Give your eyelids a gentle washing prior to applying an adhesive. Too much oil or makeup will cause problems for the adhesive, resulting in your eyelids not adhering properly. If you wish to wear makeup, apply after putting on the adhesive. If using tape, cut a small thin strip that roughly matches the length of your eye. The tape should be completely obscured under the crease of your eye, so avoid cutting the tape too “wide.”  Cutting an appropriate size may take some trial and error. Pre-cut strips may also have to be modified to fit without being visible. Not all eyes are the same! The shape of your eye, even if \\"almond,\\" can vary drastically from another set of almond eyes. Review your eye carefully, and talk to a beautician if you need advice specific to your own eye shape. Find the crease of your eye and apply the adhesive along the crease. Look in the mirror if you aren’t quite sure where your to find your crease, or have a friend help while you apply the adhesive.  Both eyelid glue and tape can be removed with warm water, or a small amount of makeup remover. Take care when removing the tape from your eyelids. Peel slowly to avoid stretching out your eyelids. Eyelid liquid glue comes with a small applicator. Once you have applied the glue, use the applicator to push a portion of the upper eyelid upward, so that the glue adheres to nearby skin, creating a fold. Note that both types of eyelid adhesives, particularly the liquid, may require physical adjustments to adhere in place. Practice using the applicator to create an additional eyelid fold prior to applying the glue. This saves you the trouble of having to reapply the glue if you apply the adhesive incorrectly the first time. Make sure your eyelid folds are to your liking and have a strong enough bond to last throughout the day. It will take some practice to get the perfect look on both eyes. If you feel one type of adhesive does not work well, give the other a try and see if it works better.  Eyelid glue will last longer based on how much you layer on your eyelid. A thinner layer will dry quickly, but only last a few hours, whereas a thicker layer will last longer, though it will also feel more noticeable. Eyelid tape holds stronger than glue, but can be felt much more easily in the eyelid, meaning it may be uncomfortable over longer periods of time. Sweat and oil can cause the glue to lose its hold as the day wears on, so reapplication may be necessary (most notably in eyelid glue). What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the use of eyelid glue and eyelid tape as cosmetic items to create a \\"second eyelid\\" for individuals with mono-eyelids.

Choose your answer from: - Place a large wad of gum high on a wall where kids can't reach. Knives, even scissors will stick to the magnetic surface and these will still be convenient to access by adults.; - Place a magnetic strip high on a wall where kids can't reach. Knives, even scissors will stick to the magnetic surface and these will still be convenient to access by adults.; Answer:","output":"The best way to safely store kitchen knives out of reach of little fingers and hands is to place a magnetic strip high on a wall where kids can't reach. Knives, even scissors, will stick to the magnetic surface, and these will still be convenient to access by adults. This method not only keeps the sharp objects out of the reach of children but also provides an organized and visually appealing storage solution for your kitchen. Here is a more detailed explanation of why this option is superior to using a large wad of gum or other methods: 1. Safety: The magnetic strip will securely hold the knives, ensuring that they won't accidentally fall off or be easily pulled down by curious hands. On the other hand, a wad of gum might not provide the same level of stability, and knives could potentially fall if the gum loses its adhesion over time. 2. Accessibility: By placing the magnetic strip high on the wall, it will be within easy reach for adults but not for little ones. This ensures that the adults in the household can quickly and easily grab a knife when needed, without having to worry about child safety locks or other barriers. 3. Organization: A magnetic strip allows for a neat and orderly display of your knives, which can help improve the overall organization of your kitchen. In contrast, a wad of gum would not offer this benefit and could create an unsightly and disorganized appearance. 4. Hygiene: Using a magnetic strip for knife storage is much more hygienic than using a large wad of gum. Over time, gum can collect dirt, dust, and other debris, increasing the likelihood of contamination when knives come into contact with it. A magnetic strip can be easily wiped down to maintain cleanliness. 5. Durability: A well-constructed magnetic strip will be much more durable and long-lasting compared to a wad of gum, which can lose its stickiness and become less effective over time. Additionally, a magnetic strip is likely to be made of materials specifically designed for kitchen use, ensuring that it will not be affected by humidity, temperature changes, or other environmental factors. In conclusion, using a magnetic strip mounted high on a wall is the most practical and effective way to safely store kitchen knives out of reach of small hands. This method provides a safe, accessible, organized, hygienic, and durable solution for knife storage while helping to maintain a visually appealing kitchen space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose you will be determine more what you need happens, how will it affect a LARGER white dwarf star.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis refers to a scenario where an external or internal disturbance affects the evolution of a celestial body, such as a white dwarf star. Based on the given process of a red giant evolving into a white dwarf, we can examine how a perturbation might affect a larger white dwarf star: 1. Effect on Fusion: If the perturbation affects the white dwarf's core temperature, it can have a direct impact on the fusion reaction taking place. A higher core temperature may lead to the fusion of elements beyond carbon and oxygen (such as neon and magnesium), whereas a lower core temperature would decrease fusion and lead to faster cooling. 2. Mass Loss or Gain: If the perturbation results in an increase or decrease of the white dwarf's mass, it can significantly affect its evolution. For instance, if the white dwarf gains sufficient mass from a companion star or other external sources, it can cross the critical Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 solar masses) and potentially undergo a Type Ia supernova explosion. 3. Structural Changes: If the perturbation leads to drastic changes in the structure or composition of the white dwarf, it may alter its life cycle. In general, this may affect the white dwarf's luminosity, temperature, and cooling rate. 4. External Factors: If the perturbation involves the intervention of a companion star or other celestial bodies, their mutual gravitational interaction can affect the white dwarf's orbit, rotation, and overall evolution. For example, two white dwarfs in a close binary system can merge under certain circumstances, leading to the formation of a more massive white dwarf or, if crossing the Chandrasekhar limit, a supernova explosion. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis can potentially have both direct and indirect effects on a larger white dwarf star. The specific impact depends on the nature of the perturbation and its influence on the star's core temperature, mass, structure, and surrounding celestial environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz.  David wants to categorize animals according to the sound waves they can hear. Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C.  Which group would be able to hear lower frequency, group A or group B? A:","output":"Group A would be able to hear lower frequency sounds compared to Group B. This is because Group A consists of animals that can only hear infrasound, which refers to sounds with frequencies below 20 Hz. In contrast, Group B includes animals that can hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz, just like humans. Since infrasound has lower frequencies than the range heard by humans and animals in Group B, Group A would be the one able to hear lower frequency sounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This question has options. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you split something? Choices: (1). cut it open. (2). break it in two.","output":"There are a few ways to accomplish the goal of splitting something, depending on the nature of the object and the tools and methods available. First, let's take a look at the choices presented and then discuss some other methods you can apply. Choice 1: Cut it open Cutting an object open is an efficient way to split it, especially for soft or flexible materials. For example, slicing bread, scoring a piece of paper for folding, or using scissors to cut fabric. Generally, cutting requires a sharp tool such as a blade or scissors to make a clean incision or slit in the object. Here are some steps to guide you in cutting an object open: 1. Choose the right tool: A sharp knife, a pair of scissors, a box cutter, or any other cutting tool suited for the object you want to split. 2. Safety first: Ensure you are handling the cutting tool safely. Always point the sharp end away from your body and fingers, and use protective gloves if necessary. 3. Measure and mark: If precision is necessary, measure the object and mark a guideline where you want to cut it. You can also use a ruler or any straight-edged tool for guidance. 4. Begin cutting: Hold the object securely and make a steady, slow, and controlled cut. Apply even pressure as you move the cutting tool along the guideline. 5. Repeat if necessary: Depending on the thickness or toughness of the object, you may need multiple passes or slightly adjusting the cutting tool to achieve a clean split. Choice 2: Break it in two Breaking an object in two is an appropriate method for splitting harder, more rigid materials. Sometimes, a simple hand force can be sufficient, such as snapping a pencil in half or breaking a chocolate bar. For more substantial objects, you might need a tool such as a hammer or even specialized equipment like hydraulic splitters for materials like concrete. Here are some steps to guide you in breaking an object in two: 1. Choose the right tool: Depending on the object, you might use your hands, a hammer, a chisel, a saw, or another breaking tool. 2. Safety first: Wear proper protective gear, such as gloves, goggles, or a face shield, depending on the material you're breaking. 3. Determine the split point: Identify the precise point where you want to split the object. For some materials, you may need to create a score or starter mark to guide the process. 4. Apply pressure or force: Use the breaking tool to hit or apply pressure to the object. Controlled, focused force is essential for a clean break. 5. Check the break: Inspect the object to ensure it split cleanly. If not, repeat the previous step to refine the split or break off any imperfections. Other methods you can use to split something: - Peel or pry apart: Some objects can be carefully peeled or pried apart using a thin, flat tool like a knife or a screwdriver. - Sawing: For thicker, more substantial materials such as wood or metal, you can use a hand or power saw to separate the pieces. - Chemically dissolving: For specific materials, chemicals such as solvents can dissolve the object's bonding agents, effectively splitting it apart. In conclusion, the method you choose for splitting an object will depend on the object's nature, the tools available, and your desired outcome. By choosing the appropriate technique and following safety measures, you can split an object effectively and efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This crystal, also known as Die of Power, has the ability to stabilize the flow of time, preventing any attempts to manipulate the past and ensuring that Anteverth's timeline remains undisturbed. The story begins in the city of Luminesa, a center of science, magic, and cultural exchange. Lurking in its depths are two secret societies, one dedicated to utilizing technology for personal gain and the other committed to harnessing the power of magic over time. When both factions learn of a hidden map that can lead to the location of the Anti-backwards Crystal, they initiate an intense race to possess it, believing that its power will lift their respective clans to unprecedented heights. Caught in the middle of this dangerous pursuit is Aria, a young and brilliant engineer who has spent her life working on eco-friendly and sustainable technology to improve living conditions in Luminesa. Unbeknownst to her, she is the last descendant of the ancient guardians who created and hid the Die of Power. She holds the key to unlocking its true potential. With the secret societies threatening her friends and family, Aria forms an unlikely alliance with Kylan, a rogue mage who was expelled from the magical society for his radical beliefs on the fusion of technology and magic. Together, they race to find the Anti-backwards Crystal, while navigating a world of mysterious creatures, treacherous landscapes, and the blurred lines between good and evil. As Aria and Kylan venture deeper into the ancient secrets of the Die of Power, they discover that its true purpose was not to maintain power in the hands of a single person or group, but to protect the delicate balance between the technological and magical factions in Anteverth. If any one side were to gain control of the crystal, the harmony that sustained their world for centuries would be shattered and the very fabric of time would unravel. The duo must also confront their own demons, with Aria wrestling between her sense of duty and her longing for a simple life, while Kylan grapples with the knowledge that his ideas were used for nefarious purposes by his former society. In the end, they must come to terms with the sacrifices required to ensure the survival of Anteverth and the complicated nature of power. As the climax of the movie arrives, Aria and Kylan manage to recover the Anti-backwards Crystal, fighting against enemies from both factions who strive to claim it for themselves. Realizing the danger of entrusting the Die of Power to any one individual or group, they choose to neutralize the crystal, restoring balance to Anteverth and preventing its abuse by any faction. The movie concludes with Aria and Kylan bringing the warring societies to the table in an effort to promote dialogue and cooperation. With newfound knowledge of the dangers of power imbalance, Anteverth faces a future filled with potential for greater understanding and unity between the technological and magical factions. Die of Power thus becomes a thrilling and evocative adventure, weaving a tale of friendship, sacrifice, and the challenging complexities of power in a world that teeters on the edge of time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Analyze the statement In the statement, \\"A boy in a gray shirt holding two over-sized cucumbers\\", we are given information that a boy is holding two large cucumbers. There is no context provided about his whereabouts or his intention with those cucumbers. Step 2: Evaluate each answer option Option 1: It is a possible scenario, but we have no information about the boy's location or intentions, so we cannot confirm that he's shopping for groceries. Thus, this cannot be the logical choice. Option 2: The statement does not explicitly specify that the boy is shopping for groceries. There is ambiguity about his location and intentions. Therefore, \\"it is not possible to tell\\" if the boy is shopping for groceries, making this option the most logical. Option 3: Saying \\"no\\" would imply that we have enough information to confidently conclude the boy is not shopping for groceries. However, just like with option 1, we don't have enough information to prove the opposite either.

The 23-year-old is added to the 12 players on duty for the dramatic defeat by Sri Lanka at Headingley last month. Stokes made 120 against Australia in only his second Test last winter. That innings at Perth was one of the few highlights of England's 5-0 Ashes defeat by Australia and was their only century of the tour. Stokes, who also took 15 wickets in his four matches during that series, returned to domestic action in May and captured career-best match figures of 10-121 against Sussex last month. National selector James Whitaker said of his return to the international fold: \\"It's really good news for Ben and us. We know what he is capable of. \\"We always felt he needed a quantity of cricket behind him and he has had that now. It's another seamer we can add to our pool. We are going to need a depth of seamers.\\" England were unable to claim the final wicket in an enthralling first Test with Sri Lanka at Lord's, and then lost the two-match series after last man James Anderson was dismissed with the penultimate ball at Headingley. It was their first defeat in a series of more than one match against Sri Lanka, and extended their run of matches without a Test victory to eight. \\"It has been frustrating lately,\\" Whitaker added. \\"We have got ourselves into some good winning positions and what we need now is to seal it and get over the line. \\"When we are building a new team we have to build new habits. When we get the first one I think it will spark off a lot of victories and let's hope that starts next week.\\" Asked about the increasing pressure on skipper Alastair Cook, Whitaker said: \\"As selectors we back him 100% and we trust he will get England over the line very shortly. He is very resilient, full of resolve and is determined to turn it round. \\"He is building an environment that he believes can be strong and positive for English cricket and we trust him to do that.\\" England squad for first Test against India: Alastair Cook (Essex, capt), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), James Anderson (Lancashire), Gary Ballance (Yorkshire), Ian Bell (Warwickshire), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Chris Jordan (Sussex), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Matt Prior (Sussex, wk), Sam Robson (Middlesex), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Ben Stokes (Durham), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire) What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the return of English all-rounder Ben Stokes to the England Test squad after recovering from a wrist injury that he sustained during a tour of West Indies in March. Stokes, aged 23 at the time, had missed the early part of the season due to surgery on his fractured wrist, which he had injured by punching a locker.  Stokes' inclusion in the team adds to the 12 players who had played in the dramatic defeat by Sri Lanka at Headingley the previous month. The talented all-rounder had scored 120 against Australia in his second Test match during the winter, which was one of the few highlights of England's disappointing 5-0 Ashes series defeat. He also took 15 wickets in his four matches during that series. Stokes made a successful return to domestic cricket in May, capturing his career-best match figures of 10-121 against Sussex. National selector James Whitaker expressed his delight at Stokes' return, noting that it adds depth to the team's pool of seam bowlers. The article also highlights England's frustration in recent matches, having failed to secure a Test victory in their previous eight games, and the pressure on captain Alastair Cook to turn the team's fortunes around. Whitaker reinforced the selectors' support for Cook, stating that they trust Cook's determination and vision for building a strong and positive environment for English cricket.

Here is another sentence: He was arrested and taken down to Sun Hill nick police station to be charged. Does the term nick mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"To determine if the term 'nick' means the same thing in both sentences, I will analyze the context of each sentence. 1. In the first sentence: \\"He's just been released from Shadwell nick prison after doing ten years for attempted murder.\\" In this sentence, 'nick' is used to describe a prison where the person has been held for ten years. It appears to be a slang term for prison. 2. In the second sentence: \\"He was arrested and taken down to Sun Hill nick police station to be charged.\\" In this sentence, 'nick' is used in the context of a police station where the person was taken to be charged. Step by step analysis: 1. Identify the context of 'nick' in both sentences. 2. Compare the contextual meaning of 'nick' in both sentences. In conclusion, the term 'nick' seems to carry a similar meaning in both sentences as it is used to describe a place of detention - a prison in the first sentence and a police station in the second sentence. Although not exactly the same, as a prison is a long-term detention facility and a police station may detain temporarily, they are closely related in terms of their function, so the term 'nick' can be considered to have a similar meaning in both sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available options: (a). no; (b). yes;","output":"To answer this question, we should first understand the context and scope of each question and then compare them to see if they have the same meaning.  1. What are the challenges that Media and Entertainment industry in India are facing today? To address this question, my approach would be: Step 1: Define the context - The Media and Entertainment industry in India comprises various segments such as television, radio, films, music, gaming, and online content platforms, among others. Step 2: Identify the challenges - I would look into current issues affecting this industry in India specifically, such as censorship, infrastructure and funding limitations, piracy, talent management, regional content distribution, and the impact of global players. Step 3: Analyze the challenges - I would further delve into each challenge, understand its implications, and provide examples. 2. What are the challenges faced by traditional media? To address this question, my approach would be: Step 1: Define the context - Traditional media refers to communication channels like newspapers, magazines, television, and radio. Step 2: Identify the challenges - I would investigate the difficulties encountered by traditional media, including changing consumer preferences, emergence of new media platforms, advertisement revenue decline, adapting to digitalization, maintaining credibility, and staying relevant. Step 3: Analyze the challenges - I would examine each challenge in detail, providing examples and demonstrating its impact on traditional media. Now, to compare the two questions: The first question focuses on the broader Media and Entertainment industry in India, while the second question zeroes in on traditional media, not confined to a specific country.

Countless lives have been lost, homes and livelihoods have been ruined, and families have been torn apart. However, the suffering and anguish for some do not end here, as many are now also facing the unbearable reality that their loved ones remain buried beneath the rubble. A Painful Reminder Every day, family members of the missing persons continue their desperate quest for answers and closure, even though the search and rescue operations have come to an end. The piles of debris, once bustling homes, and establishments now serve as a painful reminder of the losses incurred in a blink of an eye. Unable to attain peace without knowing the fate of their dear ones, their emotional wounds deepen, and their tribulation multiplies. The Fading Hope With each passing day, the hope that once burned bright within the hearts of the families searching for their loved ones starts to wane. The overwhelming fear of their kin being trapped under the wreckage gnaws at their souls, making it hard to sleep, eat and spend time with their surviving family members. The unbelievable thought that they might never fully give them a proper goodbye vastly extends their grieving process. This mental and emotional wear and tear takes its toll, leaving these families struggling to get through each day. The Unfulfilled Responsibility In the aftermath of a disaster, the authorities often face immense pressure and responsibilities, which include ensuring that the impacted areas are provided with essentials and taking steps towards the rehabilitation of survivors. However, the most critical responsibility is the accurate recovery and identification of the deceased, so their families can attain closure. Unfortunately, six months on, many of these families' cries for help have fallen on deaf ears, and they are left feeling abandoned by the very people and organizations that were supposed to assist them in their hour of need. Causes of Delay The reasons for this delay may vary, ranging from logistical challenges, damaged infrastructures, or limited manpower and resources the authorities might be grappling with. Nevertheless, the lack of accountability and transparency in this process aggravates the victims' families' despair, and the unsatisfactory communication between the authorities and families only exacerbates their agony. A Plea for Action The grieving families continue to plea for prompt action and perseverance in locating their beloved ones still buried beneath the rubble. Their petitions often echo with an appeal to officials to prioritize the identification and recovery of the deceased. This issue can no longer be brushed under the carpet, as the pain of these families will persist each day they spend without knowing the fate of their lost ones. A Ray of Light Amid the heartache, the keenness exhibited by several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and volunteers in assisting these families offers a ray of light to those enveloped in darkness. These rescuers have demonstrated unwavering commitment to work with the affected families and advocate for a reform to address the inaction that plagues their lives. Even though their resources might be limited, their determination and passion embody hope where formal institutions have failed. In conclusion, as the families' ordeal continues to unfold, it is imperative for societies to recognize the agony experienced by these loved ones, whose lives are suspended in limbo. By raising awareness, lending a helping hand in these circumstances, and demanding better assistance from the authorities, we can prove that we have not forgotten them and are committed to bringing justice to their cause. By doing so, we provide a glimmer of hope to their hearts and work towards giving them the closure they deserve."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: The Ottoman administration brought a significant improvement to Cyprus in terms of water supply. The most notable example of this is the Bekir Pasha Aqueduct, built under the auspices of Ebubekir Pasha between 1746 and 1748. This aqueduct supplied fresh water to Larnaca and prior to its construction, local residents had to carry water on their backs for two hours. Silihtar aqueduct, built between 1801 and 1803, and the Arab Ahmet aqueduct supplied water to Nicosia. The authorities also encouraged the construction and improvement of artificial channels for water supply and irrigation, which greatly increased crop yield and allowed large-scale fruit production. Among villages described as prosperous due to artificial irrigation upon the British takeover of the island are Morphou, Lapithos, Polis, Lefka, Avdimou and Kolossi. Samuel Baker, who visited Cyprus in 1879, noted \\"mills turned by water\\" and \\"narrow lanes streaming with water\\" in Lefka. He also wrote that \\"every garden and farm was irrigated by water conducted from the mountains in artificial channels\\" in the northern slopes of the Kyrenia Mountains extending to the Karpas Peninsula. In Karavas, streams were diverted into artificial channels to supply water to the village. In the 19th century, a major effort was undertaken by a series of Ottoman governors to straighten and regulate the course of the Pedieos. Edhem Pasha, who served as governor in the 1840s, completed the construction of the Larnaca-Nicosia road and several bridges. Governor Mehmet Halet in the 1850s further improved the road network and harbour of Larnaca and established a grain store and market in Nicosia to encourage cattle breeding.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. To start with, Cordell Jude was hungry. He was 22, the spring days were growing longer and the temperature in Phoenix had climbed to 80 degrees that Tuesday in April 2012. It was not much cooler as the sun slipped behind the Sierra Estrella mountains, so shortly before 8 pm, Jude drove with his pregnant fianceÃ© toward a suburban intersection crowded with fast-food restaurants, a Home Depot, a Starbucks, drug stores and gas stations. Not far off, another man was headed the same way. Daniel Adkins was 29, older than Jude, but mentally disabled. His family described him as more like a 12- or 13-year-old. Adkins was walking his yellow Labrador retriever named Lady past a Taco Bell in the gathering evening, when he stepped around a blind corner and was nearly hit by Jude's vehicle. Police say the two men exchanged angry words, the dispute rapidly escalated, and it ended when Jude pulled out a .40-caliber pistol and shot Adkins dead. Jude, who was still in his car at the time of the shooting, told police it was self-defense, that Adkins had lunged at him with a bat of some kind. But investigators found no such weapon, and even if they had County Attorney Bill Montgomery says, \\"The threshold that people believe needs to be crossed when they brandish a weapon, never mind actually use it ... is a lot higher than what it actually is.\\" Jude is now charged with murder in that killing last year, and because he is black and Adkins was not, the case is drawing comparisons to the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman. Why the comparison? If Jude is convicted, some would argue there's racism in the justice system. In the Florida case, a black teen is killed and an Hispanic shooter is acquitted. In the other, a black man who claims self-defense faces prison time. Unstable ground: The fine line between self-defense and murder. The key questions being asked by many: If Zimmerman was acquitted because he felt threatened, shouldn't Jude also walk? And if he doesn't, will his race and that of the victim have played a role? The nation has a long history of self-defense laws. Almost every state allows some version of the \\"castle\\" defense, as in \\"a man's home is his castle.\\" These laws generally allow people to defend themselves, their family and their property against anyone who intrudes upon their living space, with deadly force if necessary. CNN legal analyst Mark NeJame says, \\"If you walk into my house uninvited, odds are you aren't going to be walking out. And most people support that. You're going to protect your home and your family, and there's very little argument about that.\\" It gets trickier when we start talking about so-called \\"stand your ground\\" laws which exist in more than 20 states. Those laws extend the castle principle so that if you are legally in some place --a parking lot, a mall, a football stadium -- it becomes like your home. Accordingly, if someone attempts to attack you there, once again you are free to fight back and are under no compunction to attempt to avoid the conflict. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder finds such laws troubling, saying they \\"senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods. These laws try to fix something that was never broken.\\" But if self-defense laws have never been broken, many legal analysts have long noted that they can certainly be bent. Rob a bank, steal a car, set fire to a house and authorities usually don't much care how you feel about the crime. But self-defense cases are all about feelings. Why did the person feel afraid? Was that fear justified? Was the response warranted? NeJame says that is where the slope gets slippery. \\"The standard is generally what a reasonable person would do under the circumstances and do you reasonably fear death or bodily injury? That's a very subjective standard. It's not an objective standard. We're all human beings. Everyone is going to perceive something differently.\\" The Zimmerman case illustrates his point perfectly. Many African-American trial watchers had no trouble seeing Zimmerman -- trailing after Martin with his cell phone on a rainy night -- as the aggressor. That interpretation makes sense if you frame it with a long history of black people feeling unfairly targeted by police, security guards and others. As President Barack Obama put it Friday, \\"I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida.\\" Many whites, however, have enjoyed a different relationship with the police and saw Martin as an architect of his own violent end. They asked: Why didn't he call the police if he felt threatened? Why didn't he ask Zimmerman if something was wrong and explain where he was going? Everyone who watched the trial saw the same facts and heard the same witnesses, but like characters in the old Japanese film \\"Rashomon\\" they came away with different stories. Grappling with such vagaries is the challenge in a great many self-defense cases. To be sure, sometimes cases in which people are purportedly protecting themselves or their property are easy to sort out. Protesters stand up to 'stand your ground,' but laws likely here to stay. Just this past week in Milwaukee, 76-year-old John Spooner, who is white, faced charges that he killed a 13-year-old neighbor who was black. Spooner accused Darius Simmons of burglarizing his home, and two days later accosted the young man as he retrieved his family's trash cans from the curb. On a surveillance tape, Spooner is seen emerging from his house with a pistol in hand, waving the weapon at Simmons, and ultimately shooting him at a distance of five or six feet. The boy, who offered no visible signs of resistance during the entire confrontation, died on the street in his mother's arms. Spooner's lawyers argued that their client suffers from mental illness, saying \\"He didn't appreciate the wrongfulness of what he was doing\\" as he railed about his property. The court did not buy it, and Spooner was convicted. But so many other matters of self or property defense involve difficult, complicated questions. Was the defendant previously assaulted and thereby living in a state of heightened alarm? Was he or she a naturally excitable or nervous type? Did something else happen near the same time or in close proximity to the final incident that might have spurred an excessive reaction? \\"We have to defend ourselves if someone is truly coming after us,\\" NeJame says. \\"The last thing anyone wants to do is put themselves, their home or their family at risk. On the other hand, we need to make it so that we don't have a trigger-happy society.\\" All of that means in the end, as much as people may want to find a perfect parallel to the Zimmerman case; a \\"gotcha\\" verdict from some other place in which a black man is convicted for doing just what Zimmerman did, it is unlikely. Because self-defense cases that look alike from a distance on a dark evening, may be substantially different when the details and defendants are dragged into the light of day.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Kursk is a city and the administrative center of Kursk Oblast, Russia, located at the confluence of the Kur, Tuskar, and Seym Rivers. The area around Kursk was the site of a turning point in the SovietGerman struggle during World War II and the site of the largest tank battle in history. Population:   - The Battle of Kursk was a Second World War engagement between German and Soviet forces on the Eastern Front near Kursk (south-west of Moscow) in the Soviet Union during July and August 1943. The German offensive was code-named Operation Citadel and led to one of the largest armoured clashes in history, the Battle of Prokhorovka. The German offensive was countered by two Soviet counter-offensives, Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev and Operation Kutuzov. For the Germans, the battle was the final strategic offensive that they were able to launch on the Eastern Front. Their extensive loss of men and tanks ensured that the victorious Soviet Red Army enjoyed the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war.  - Operation Kutuzov was a major offensive launched by the Red Army on 12 July 1943, in the Central Russian Upland, against Army Group Center of the German \\"Wehrmacht\\". The operation was named after General Mikhail Kutuzov, the Russian general credited with saving Russia from Napoleon during the French invasion of Russia in 1812. Operation Kutuzov was one of two large-scale Soviet operations launched as counteroffensives against Operation Citadel. The Operation began on 12 July and ended on 18 August 1943 with the capture of Orel and collapse of the Orel bulge.  - The Battle of Prokhorovka was fought on 12 July 1943 near Prokhorovka, southeast of Kursk, in the Soviet Union, during the Second World War. Taking place on the Eastern Front, the fighting was part of the wider Battle of Kursk, and occurred when the 5th Guards Tank Army of the Soviet Red Army attacked the II SS-Panzer Corps of the German Wehrmacht in one of the largest tank battles in military history.  - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991.  - The 216th Infantry Division was a German Army division that was created during the Second World War ; it was active from 1939 -- 1943 . It served on the Western Front in 1940 , and later took part in the Eastern Front campaign , being involved in the disastrous Battle of Kursk .  - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To mix eggs, oil, and grapefruit juice together, you can","output":"follow these steps below to successfully create a well-blended mixture. This process will require some basic kitchen tools and ingredients. Ensure you have gathered everything you need before starting. Ingredients: 1. Eggs 2. Oil (preferably a neutral oil like vegetable or canola oil) 3. Grapefruit juice (freshly squeezed or store-bought) Tools: 1. A whisk or electric mixer 2. A mixing bowl 3. A citrus juicer (if using fresh grapefruit) 4. A measuring cup 5. A spatula or spoon 6. A fork (if you don't have a whisk) 7. Paper towels or a clean cloth to clean up any spills Procedure: Step 1: Prepare the ingredients If you are using fresh grapefruits, cut the grapefruits in half and use a citrus juicer to extract the juice. Strain the juice to remove any seeds or pulp.Measure out the required amount of grapefruit juice, eggs, and oil according to your recipe or desired quantity. Step 2: Break the eggs Crack the eggs into the mixing bowl, making sure not to get any shell fragments into the bowl. If any shell pieces do end up in the bowl, use a spoon or your fingers to carefully remove them. Step 3: Whisk the eggs Using the whisk, electric mixer, or a fork, beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are thoroughly combined and the mixture appears smooth and slightly frothy. This step is essential for ensuring a homogenous mixture when you add the other ingredients. Step 4: Add the grapefruit juice Slowly pour the measured grapefruit juice into the bowl with the beaten eggs, while continually whisking or mixing. Make sure to mix thoroughly so that the juice is fully incorporated into the eggs. This will create a smooth, evenly blended liquid. Step 5: Add the oil Gradually pour the oil into the egg and grapefruit juice mixture. While pouring, continue to whisk or mix the ingredients constantly. It's crucial to maintain a steady, vigorous mixing motion to ensure that the oil is appropriately emulsified and incorporated into the mixture. If you add the oil too quickly or do not mix well enough, the oil may not combine with the other ingredients, resulting in a separated mixture. Step 6: Check the consistency Once you have combined all the ingredients, check the consistency of the mixture. It should be smooth and well-blended, with a slightly frothy appearance. If you observe any separation or uneven mixing, continue to whisk or mix until the mixture reaches the desired consistency. Step 7: Clean up Wipe down any spills on your work area using paper towels or a clean cloth. Be sure to wash your tools and bowls promptly to avoid residue buildup, making them easier to clean. Step 8: Use the mixture You can now use the blended mixture of eggs, oil, and grapefruit juice in your desired recipe. Some possible uses include salad dressings, marinades, baking, or as a unique base for smoothies. By following this method, you can successfully create a consistent and well-blended mixture of eggs, oil, and grapefruit juice. Practice your mixing skills and experiment with different quantities or ingredients to achieve various flavors and textures in your culinary creations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The group was formed in Sheffield, England, in 1977 and originally consisted of Martyn Ware, Ian Craig Marsh, and Philip Oakey. Later, Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley joined the group, expanding the lineup that produced their most successful album \\"Dare\\" in 1981. \\"Don't You Want Me\\" was the fourth and final single released from the \\"Dare\\" album on November 27, 1981. The song, written by Philip Oakey and co-produced by Martin Rushent, went on to become a massive hit, spending five weeks atop the UK Singles Chart and becoming the Christmas number one, ultimately making it the band's most successful single.  The song also crossed over to the United States and became their first and only Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit the following year. The song's popularity is also demonstrated by its music video, which enjoyed heavy rotation on MTV in the early 1980s. The video, directed by Steve Barron, features Sulley and Oakey in a cinematic narrative, emphasizing the song's story of a romance gone awry. \\"Don't You Want Me\\" has since been covered by numerous artists and has been used in various commercials and films. Its lasting impact on pop culture is evident, as the song remains a defining track of the 1980s synthpop and New Wave movements.

There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian boulevard slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the rhapsody. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This jeu d'esprit was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call \\"leg-Poulenc\\". Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot. In completely arbitrary fashion Collet chose the names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, for no other reason than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art ... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being. Cocteau, though similar in age to Les Six, was something of a father-figure to the group. His literary style, \\"paradoxical and lapidary\\" in Hell's phrase, was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent. It greatly appealed to Poulenc, who made his first setting of Cocteau's words in 1919 and his last in 1961. When members of Les Six collaborated with each other, they contributed their own individual sections to the joint work. Their 1920 piano suite L'Album des Six consists of six separate and unrelated pieces. Their 1921 ballet Les mariés de la tour Eiffel contains three sections by Milhaud, two apiece by Auric, Poulenc and Tailleferre, one by Honegger and none by Durey, who was already distancing himself from the group.In the early 1920s Poulenc remained concerned at his lack of formal musical training. Satie was suspicious of music colleges, but Ravel advised Poulenc to take composition lessons; Milhaud suggested the composer and teacher Charles Koechlin. Poulenc worked with him intermittently from 1921 to 1925.  Question: What is the name of the person whose leanings were reportedly \\"towards a Mediterranean lyrical art\\"?

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Mala (Evan Rachel Wood) and her friend Senn (Justin Long) are young alien creatures who live on Terra, a planet from a star system in the Milky Way. Terra is a peaceful planet of alien creatures who have a rich semi-advanced culture. One day a large, mysterious object blocks the Terrian sun, piquing the Terrians' interest. However, since the Terrian culture bans the development of new technologies, such as telescopes, without the approval of the ruling council, none of the inhabitants are able to get a closer look at the huge object in their sky. Mala, who is inventive and headstrong, goes against the rules of her community and creates a telescope, which she takes out into the dark empty area outside the Terrian city and uses to view the object and witnesses smaller objects coming from the large object that turn out to be incoming scout spaceships. She returns to the city to find that the scout spaceships have already started abducting Terrians (who willingly offer themselves to the scout spaceships mistaking them as their new \\"gods\\"). After Mala's own father, Roven (Dennis Quaid) is abducted she goads a ship into tailing her and lures it into a trap, which causes it to crash. Afterward, she saves the life of the pilot, revealed to be a human, an officer named Lieutenant Jim Stanton (Luke Wilson). After his personal robot assistant named Giddy (David Cross) warns Mala that Stanton will die without a supply of oxygen (which the Terrian atmosphere does not contain), she creates an oxygen generator and fills a tent with air containing oxygen so that Jim can breathe, and eventually convinces Giddy to teach her human language.

However, there are some small differences in the sentences that slightly affect their overall similarity score. First, the sentence \\"A brown and black dog is jumping to catch a red ball.\\" employs the present progressive verb tense, which shows an ongoing action (i.e., \\"is jumping\\"). On the other hand, the sentence \\"A brown and black dog jumps for a red ball.\\" uses the simple present tense to show a general activity (i.e., \\"jumps\\").

Ethiopian historians such as Taddesse Tamrat (1935–2013) and Sergew Hable Sellassie have argued that modern Ethiopian studies were an invention of the 17th century and originated in Europe. Tamrat considered Carlo Conti Rossini's 1928 Storia d'Etiopia a groundbreaking work in Ethiopian studies. The philosopher Messay Kebede likewise acknowledged the genuine contributions of Western scholars to the understanding of Ethiopia's past. But he also criticized the perceived scientific and institutional bias that he found to be pervasive in Ethiopian-, African-, and Western-made historiographies on Ethiopia. Specifically, Kebede took umbrage at E. A. Wallis Budge's translation of the Kebra Nagast, arguing that Budge had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba although the Kebra Nagast itself did not indicate such a provenience for this fabled ruler. According to Kebede, a South Arabian extraction was contradicted by biblical exegetes and testimonies from ancient historians, which instead indicated that the Queen was of African origin. Additionally, he chided Budge and Ullendorff for their postulation that the Aksumite civilization was founded by Semitic immigrants from South Arabia. Kebede argued that there is little physical difference between the Semitic-speaking populations in Ethiopia and neighboring Cushitic-speaking groups to validate the notion that the former groups were essentially descendants of South Arabian settlers, with a separate ancestral origin from other local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. He also observed that these Afroasiatic-speaking populations were heterogeneous, having interbred with each other and also assimilated alien elements of both uncertain extraction and negroid origin.

Here's how I would approach it: 1. Identify key details - these include Spain, Euro, Arròs negre, Felipe VI of Spain, Catalonia, Parliament of Catalonia 2. Understand the relationships - Spain uses the Euro and its leader is Felipe VI; Arròs negre is a dish from Catalonia, a region of Spain whose leadership is the Parliament of Catalonia. 3. Form the sentence - Combine these details in a way that flows naturally and is grammatically accurate. Here's the sentence: \\"In Spain, a country whose currency is the Euro and is led by Felipe VI, you can enjoy a traditional dish called Arròs negre, particularly in Catalonia, a region governed by the Parliament of Catalonia.\\"  In this sentence, all the details are included and it reads quite naturally. It provides information about Spain as a whole before zooming into Catalonia, identifying this as the key area for the traditional dish. This approach feels logical since it moves from the general (Spain) to the specific (Catalonia, Arròs negre)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article that answers the following question: What happened first, the occupation of the Maya capital, or the creation of a capital in Payo Obispo?","output":"Title: The Story of the Maya Capital and Payo Obispo: Which Came First? Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there were two special places called the Maya capital and Payo Obispo. Some people wondered which one of these places was created first. Today, we will tell you their stories and which one happened before the other. First, let's talk about the Maya capital. The Maya people were a fascinating group who lived long, long ago in a region called Mesoamerica. Mesoamerica is a beautiful area that includes countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and some other places in Central America. The Maya people built big cities, which had pyramids, temples, and palaces. Their biggest and grandest city was called the Maya capital. The people who lived in the Maya civilization were super smart. They knew about the stars and the planets. They could write using symbols called hieroglyphs, and they made stunning artworks, colorful clothes, and yummy food like chocolate. The Maya civilization existed for a very long time, from about 2000 B.C. until 1500 A.D. Now, let's learn about Payo Obispo. Payo Obispo is another name for a small town called Chetumal. Chetumal is in a country named Mexico. It is near the sea, which touches the magical Caribbean, with waters full of pretty fish and treasured corals. People from different lands came to Payo Obispo to trade and do business because it was close to the sea and accessible. But Payo Obispo was born much later in time than the Maya capital. The story of the Payo Obispo started in the year 1898 A.D. That's when people decided it was an excellent place for a town and began to build a capital there. Because it was near the sea, many more people could travel there easily.  Now that we have shared the stories of the Maya capital and Payo Obispo, we can answer our question. Which came first? The occupation of the Maya capital happened a long, long time before the creation of a capital in Payo Obispo! The Maya capital's story started around 2000 B.C., while the Payo Obispo's story began only in 1898 A.D., making the Maya capital much older.  So, the next time someone asks you if the Maya civilization or Payo Obispo came first, you can tell them the enchanting stories of these two places and say that the Maya capital came first, way before Payo Obispo was even thought of!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation:  1. Identify the period of Stalin's version: Stalin's version of events started to be propagated in the late 1930s, during his time as the leader of the Soviet Union, and continued to be the official narrative afterwards. 2. Consider the scope of that version in the Soviet Union: The version persisted in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs, and textbooks published in the Soviet Union. This shows the pervasiveness and influence of the narrative in the country. 3. Assess the end of this narrative: The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 marked the end of Stalin's version as the official, unquestioned narrative of what happened between the Germans and the Soviets. Hence, a more appropriate answer to the question would be: \\"Stalin's version of what happened between the Germans and the Soviets lasted from the late 1930s until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, as it was the predominant narrative in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs, and textbooks published in the country during that time.\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Question: Process:  - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the climate is changing happens, how will it affect LESS snow.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To analyze the effect of climate change on the process of snow formation and whether it leads to less snow, let's assess each step in the process considering the perturbation hypothesis: Step 1: Water in the clouds becomes very cold. - Climate change can cause an increase in average global temperatures, which may result in the water in clouds remaining warmer than usual. If the cloud temperature doesn't decrease enough, this could reduce the formation of ice crystals. Step 2: The cold water forms ice crystals. - If there isn't enough cold water available in the cloud due to higher temperatures, fewer ice crystals will form, ultimately leading to less snow formation. Step 3: The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets. - Warmer air temperatures from climate change can lead to increased evaporation, which might cause more water droplets in the air. However, if the water droplets do not turn into ice crystals because they remain too warm, the process of ice crystal growth could be limited. Step 4: Form snowflakes. - The formation of snowflakes depends on the existence of ice crystals and their growth. If climate change affects the formation and growth of ice crystals, fewer snowflakes will develop. Step 5: The snowflakes fall to the ground. - Even if snowflakes form, warmer temperatures near the ground due to climate change could cause the snowflakes to melt before reaching the surface, resulting in less accumulated snowfall. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that climate change can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of snow formation, leading to less snow. The primary impacts include increased temperatures that limit the formation of ice crystals, inhibit ice crystal growth, and cause premature melting of snowflakes before reaching the ground."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Arthur Chesterfield-Evans (born 16 June 1950) is an Australian medical practitioner, politician and peace activist who served as a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales from 1998 to 2007.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

Context: It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

Formed in 1998, Mary Mary was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of their best-selling debut album, Thankful (2000), which contained the hit single \\"Shackles (Praise You)\\". Their followup album Incredible (2002), reached number one on the Top Gospel Albums chart. Their third album, Mary Mary (2005), which contains themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, contains the worldwide hits \\"Heaven\\", \\"The Real Party\\", and \\"Yesterday\\". The Atkins sisters, born Erica Monique and Trecina Evette, grew up in a large family with seven siblings in Inglewood, California. Their mother, Thomasina Atkins, is an evangelist and choir director at the Church of God in Christ. Their father, Eddie A. Atkins, was also a member of the Church of God In Christ, and a youth counselor, before he died in 2013.  Due to their proximity in age, the two sisters grew up closer to one another than to any of their siblings: Darrell Atkins (born 1965, the only living boy- the second boy died as a child), Maliea Atkins (born 1967), Erica (born 1972), Tina (born 1974), Delisa Atkins-Brown (born 1977), Thomasina Atkins (born 1979), Alana Atkins-Jamison (born 1985), and Shanta Atkins (born 1986). Later, they would work creatively with over half of their siblings; Thomasina, Alana, Delisa and Shanta Atkins all sing background on Mary Mary's albums and during stage performances and Delisa was originally a member of the group but left before they started recording professionally due to pursuing college. Eventually, all eight Atkins children united on the Bobby Jones Gospel show on BET.  During this time, Erica and Trecina entered the world of church choirs, traveling gospel shows, and television productions. The sisters enrolled at El Camino College to study voice. There they encountered the division between rigorous academic study of music versus the popular musical world. \\"We had to study classical and sing arias, which was fine,\\" Erica told Times, \\"but the teachers would tell us if we sang anything else it would damage our instrument.\\" In 1995 the two toured with Michael Matthews' traveling gospel shows, Mama I'm Sorry and Sneaky.

The event happened to fall on what would have been the 95th birthday of her grandmother, Esther Snyder, who co-founded the popular burger joint with her husband, Harry. In-N-Out Burger has built a cult following over the years, attracting many loyal fans who appreciate its simple menu, fresh ingredients, and high-quality food. While the brand keeps expanding, it has maintained its focus on quality, which has helped it to become a 1.1 billion empire under Snyder's watch. Lynsi Snyder is the granddaughter of the founders and inherited the business after her father, H. Guy Snyder, passed away in 1999. Since assuming control of the company, Snyder has kept a relatively low public profile, preferring to stay private and largely away from the spotlight. However, she made an exception for the 300th franchise's grand opening, where she personally cut the big red ribbon, signifying the milestone in the company's history. Fans attending the event got an unexpected chance to meet the reclusive owner, who has been influential in maintaining the legacy of her grandparents and the overall success of the chain. Before taking on the responsibility of running the family's business, Lynsi Snyder gained experience by working in various In-N-Out Burger locations as a teenager, performing menial tasks like peeling potatoes and chopping onions. These humble beginnings allowed her to appreciate the hard work that goes into every one of her family's restaurants and develop a deep understanding of the business from the ground up. Apart from her affinity for keeping a low profile, Snyder has been through personal struggles which include three divorces. Despite her personal life, she has continued to maintain a successful grip on her family's business and has played a vital role in upholding the company's core values, including the commitment to quality food, cleanliness, and exceptional customer service that made In-N-Out Burger famous. The opening of the 300th In-N-Out Burger franchise marked a significant milestone for the Snyder family and all their loyal fans. It signaled the continuing growth of the business and the ever-growing love for their delicious burgers, served with the \\"secret sauce\\" and the distinctive Southern California charm. Under Lynsi Snyder's leadership, the In-N-Out Burger empire appears to be thriving, as she continues to build upon the successful foundation laid by her grandparents, Esther and Harry Snyder."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found that some eco-friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet (UV)   radiation that are above recognized safety limits. The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco-friendly bulbs. The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods, such as jewellery makers, and others who might have lights close to their faces, such as car mechanics. John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's centre for radiation, chemical and environmental dangers, began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them. Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus, which makes people highly sensitive to light. The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation, measured 2cm from the lightbulbs, were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer. The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn, but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this, again similar to that of sunburn. The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes.

A DJ is someone who plays music at parties and events, like when you go to a birthday party and dance to your favorite songs! But this man did something very bad and wrong. He hurt three women by doing something called \\"rape.\\" This is when someone forces another person to be part of a physical activity without their permission, and it is not okay at all. People found out about what the bad man did, and they went to a special place called a \\"court\\" to talk about it. In a court, there are people who listen to both sides of the story and then decide what should happen to the person who did something wrong. This is important because it helps to make sure that people who do bad things understand that it's not okay. So, the court listened to everything, and they decided that the bad DJ from Aberdeen was guilty. That means they were sure he had done the wrong thing. Since they found out he was guilty, the DJ would need to be punished for his actions. As a punishment, the court has decided that the bad DJ needs to go live in a place called \\"jail\\" for nine whole years. Jail is a place where people have to go when they do something very wrong, so they can't hurt anyone else. It also helps them learn that what they did is not okay, and they need to make better choices next time. In this story, we learned about a DJ from Aberdeen who did a very bad thing and is now going to jail for nine years. It shows us that it is important to always treat others with kindness and respect, and to remember that doing bad things will have consequences.

Answer choices: - light bulbs  - cactuses  - satellites  - microscope  - photons  - bushes  - energy  - focusing a lens Answer:","output":"Light bulbs are used for seeing in the absence of light, as they emit artificial light that illuminates our surroundings, allowing us to see clearly when natural light is not present. Among the provided answer choices, light bulbs are the most valid option for the purpose of seeing in the absence of light. However, it is important to note that there are other sources of artificial light that can also be used in the absence of natural light. Below is a brief explanation for each answer choice and why light bulbs remain the best option: 1. Light bulbs: As mentioned earlier, light bulbs emit artificial light when an electric current passes through a filament inside the glass bulb, which heats the filament until it starts to glow. This makes light bulbs the most effective and practical option for seeing in the absence of light. 2. Cactuses: Cactuses are plants that do not emit any form of light, making them irrelevant in providing the necessary visibility in the absence of light. 3. Satellites: Although satellites are used for various purposes, such as communication, monitoring Earth, and collecting data, they do not provide any means of seeing in the absence of light. 4. Microscopes: Microscopes are used for magnifying objects that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Though they may have built-in light sources to illuminate the subject, they are not practical for general-purpose visibility in the absence of light. 5. Photons: Photons are elementary particles of light. While they are the reason why we can see anything at all, we cannot interact with photons directly to generate light in the absence of other light sources. 6. Bushes: Bushes are plants that do not produce light, and therefore, do not provide any means of seeing in the absence of light. 7. Energy: Energy is an abstract concept and cannot be directly translated into a form that allows us to see without light. However, electrical energy is used to power light bulbs, which ultimately provides the necessary visibility in the absence of natural light. 8. Focusing a lens: Focusing a lens refers to the process of capturing and refracting light through a curved lens in optical systems like cameras or telescopes. Lenses do not generate light themselves; they only manipulate existing light sources to create images or focus the light beams. In conclusion, light bulbs are the most suitable option for seeing in the absence of light out of the given choices. They are widely accessible, affordable and specifically designed to emit artificial light that enables us to see and navigate our surroundings when natural light is not available."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This perception is based on the choice of words, expressions, and the tone used in the sentence. Let's break it down in more detail: 1. \\"Airless\\": This word implies a lack of freshness or originality, suggesting that the subject lacks any sort of unique or innovative qualities. 2. \\"Prepackaged\\": By using this word, the author is implying that the subject, or the persona being discussed, is overly manufactured or inauthentic. It insinuates that there is no true essence or substance to the individual, hinting at a calculated and heavily controlled image being presented to the public. 3. \\"Julia Roberts wannabe\\": A \\"wannabe\\" is someone who tries to copy or emulate a more successful or well-known person. In this case, it compares the subject unfavorably to Julia Roberts, suggesting that the subject is trying to replicate the actor's success or persona but failing in the process. 4. \\"Stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering\\": This phrase is a very vivid and blunt way of describing a sense of desperation in promoting a false or exaggerated image. The use of \\"stinks\\" conveys a foul and unappealing impression, while \\"hard-sell\\" denotes an aggressive and relentless marketing strategy. \\"Image-mongering\\" further emphasizes the criticism of how heavily the subject is being marketed and manipulated. 5. \\"You'll wonder if Lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit\\": This statement sarcastically questions the involvement of the publicist in crafting the image or persona being presented. It implies that the subject's publicist has as much, if not more, influence on what the audience sees as compared to any genuine or inherent qualities of the subject. The mention of \\"screenwriting credit\\" exaggerates this idea further, suggesting that the persona is so fabricated that it's akin to a scripted performance. From this analysis, it is evident that the sentiment of the sentence is strongly negative, intending to express a deep dissatisfaction and disapproval of the subject in question, mainly focusing on the artificial nature of the individual and the aggressive marketing strategies being employed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Other health problems persisted; Malloch's frostbitten feet failed to heal, and Mamen's knee, which he had dislocated during the days at Shipwreck Camp, troubled him continuously. A worrying illness began to affect many of the party, the general symptoms were swelling of the legs, ankles and other body parts, accompanied by acute lethargy. Malloch was the worst affected; he died on 17 May, but his tent-mate Mamen was too ill to see to his burial, so the body lay in the tent for several days, creating a \\"frightful smell\\", until McKinlay arrived to help. Mamen himself died ten days later of the same debilitating disease.From early June the diet was augmented with the appearance of birds. These birds and their eggs became a vital source of food; as the supply of seal meat dwindled to nothing, the party was reduced to eating rotten flippers, hide, or any part of a seal that was remotely edible. The sharing of birds became another bone of contention; according to Williamson \\"Wednesday last, [Breddy and Chafe] really obtained 6 eggs and 5 birds instead of 2 eggs and 4 birds as they reported.\\" Breddy was suspected of other thefts. On 25 June, after a gunshot was heard, Breddy was found dead in his tent. The circumstances of his death, whether accident, suicide or in Hadley's view, murder (with Williamson as the chief suspect) could not be determined. Williamson later called Hadley's suspicions \\"hallucinations and absolutely untrue.\\" Various items stolen from McKinlay were found among Breddy's personal effects.Despite the sombre outlook, the Canadian flag was raised at Rodgers Harbor on 1 July in honour of Dominion Day. Later in the month the party's spirits improved when Kuraluk caught a 600-pound (270 kg) walrus, which provided fresh meat for several days. As August came without sign of a ship and the weather began to turn wintry again, hopes of rescue fell; the party began to prepare for another winter.

(CNN) -- A deadly explosion on a bus carrying Israeli tourists outside an airport in Bulgaria was \\"clearly a terrorist attack,\\" Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday. Key Israeli politicians pointed to Iran as the likely instigator, but Israel's U.S. ambassador acknowledged they had no proof. Vania Valkova, director of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry press office, said that at least seven people were killed and about 30 wounded in the explosion in a parking lot outside Burgas Airport, on the Black Sea. The Foreign Ministry said six died and 32 people were wounded, with three in intensive care. The attack was probably initiated by a group under the auspices of \\"either Iran or other radical Muslim groups,\\" according to Barak, who cited Hezbollah and Hamas as likely suspects.

Carrying families and individuals on vacation, they were beginning their journey through Bulgaria, a popular destination for Israeli tourists due to its rich history, beautiful landscapes, and friendly relations between the two countries. As the passengers disembarked from the aircraft and made their way to the waiting buses, few could have anticipated the tragedy that was about to unfold. The explosion took place in the parking lot outside Burgas Airport, causing chaos and confusion as people scrambled for safety amidst the smoke and debris. Emergency services quickly arrived on the scene to attend to the wounded and secure the area. Investigators began looking into the incident, with all signs pointing toward a deliberate act of terrorism. The devastating attack quickly drew international attention and condemnation, with world leaders expressing their condolences to the victims and their families. Iran's alleged involvement in the attack – as suggested by key Israeli politicians and Defense Minister Ehud Barak – fueled ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, who had long been on opposing sides in the complex geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. The speculation was based on Iran's purported support for radical groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, both of which were named as possible perpetrators by Barak. As of yet, while Israel and its allies contend that the attack bears the hallmarks of Iranian-backed terrorism, they have not been able to provide concrete evidence linking Iran or any specific group to the deadly explosion. This does not, however, diminish the severity of the situation, as the incident highlights the troubling possibility that extremists might be targeting tourists and other civilians in their effort to further their agenda and promote fear and unrest. Despite the tragedy and the ongoing investigation, the resilience and solidarity of the Israeli people remain strong, as they mourn the loss of their fellow citizens and grapple with the implications of the attack. Meanwhile, the international community stands ready to provide support and assistance as needed, demonstrating that acts of terror will not succeed in undermining the collective spirit of unity and determination shared by the people of the world. In trying to make sense of the horror and pain that befell those innocent tourists, the response to this despicable act can be seen as a shining example of humanity's ability to come together in times of adversity, offering support, hope, and enduring strength in the face of tragedy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Armed with this gathered information, they curated a list of other acquaintances who had dined with them at the same place and began reaching out to them to confirm their health status and inquire about any similar experiences. This not only helped them gather more evidence, but also created awareness among their circle of friends to ensure everyone's well-being. They contacted their local health department, providing them with their findings and urging them to investigate the restaurant to protect the public from possible foodborne illness outbreaks. While awaiting the outcome of the investigation, they decided to warn their social network about their experience, posting a thorough and objective review on popular online platforms to provide insight into their situation. Additionally, they sought medical advice themselves to ensure they received the appropriate treatment for their food poisoning symptoms, and to potentially identify the particular strain of bacteria or virus that caused their sickness. This information would be crucial in further strengthening their case against the restaurant, as well as in identifying any recurring issues in the food industry. When the health department's investigation yielded evidence supporting their suspicions, they took further action to ensure that the restaurant was held accountable for their negligence. They sought legal counsel and considered filing a lawsuit against the restaurant for compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, and the emotional distress caused by their traumatic experience. Despite the restaurant implementing corrective measures in response to the investigation, Simon and his friends refused to dine at the establishment again, understanding the importance of frequenting well-managed and hygienic establishments.

Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.  Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land.

However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger, a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin, an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow, a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. A witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin. Meanwhile, Fagin is visited by the mysterious Monks, who has a strong interest in Oliver. He sends Monks to Bumble and Mrs. Corney (now Bumble's domineering wife); Monks buys from them the only thing that can identify Oliver's parentage, a locket containing his mother's portrait.

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: dolphins swim in front of astronaut .","output":"In this given sentence, the most salient words are: \\"dolphins,\\" \\"swim,\\" \\"astronaut.\\" These words are essential components of the sentence, as they convey the critical information and the overall context. \\"Dolphins\\" and \\"astronaut\\" are the main subjects, while \\"swim\\" portrays the action or activity taking place. Following is an analysis of each salient word: 1. Dolphins: Dolphins are intelligent marine mammals known for their distinct features, social skills, and advanced cognitive abilities. In this sentence, dolphins serve as the primary subject actively engaging in an activity, which is swimming. The presence of dolphins makes this sentence intriguing, as their interaction with the other subject could be interpreted as an unusual or even surreal situation. 2. Swim: The verb \\"swim\\" describes the action of moving through the water by using one's body movements, commonly associated with aquatic creatures, including dolphins. In this sentence, \\"swim\\" is the main activity that helps understand how the two subjects are interacting. It highlights the dolphins' natural behavior and emphasizes their presence in the context. 3. Astronaut: An astronaut is a trained individual involved in space exploration programs or other extraterrestrial activities, such as working in a space station or piloting a spacecraft. In this sentence, the astronaut is the second subject and appears to be in an unusual situation – facing dolphins in a context where no clear indication of water or a space-like environment is given. This creates a sense of curiosity and surrealism, leaving readers intrigued about the circumstances behind this interaction. In summary, the salient words \\"dolphins,\\" \\"swim,\\" and \\"astronaut\\" are crucial to understanding the central notion of the sentence. These words supply the necessary information regarding the subjects and actions, allowing readers to determine the context, albeit unconventional, of the dolphins swimming in front of the astronaut."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Reputedly the oldest pub in Dublin is the Legless Legolas (Channel Street Upper). Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In the given situation, the premise and hypothesis introduce different claims about the oldest pub in Dublin. To examine this more closely, let's break down the premise and hypothesis. Premise: Reputedly the oldest pub in Dublin is the Brazen Head (Bridge Street Lower). This premise claims that the Brazen Head, located on Bridge Street Lower, is reputedly the oldest pub in Dublin. This means that according to local or historical beliefs, the Brazen Head has been recognized as the oldest pub in the city. Hypothesis: Reputedly the oldest pub in Dublin is the Legless Legolas (Channel Street Upper). In contrast, the hypothesis claims that the Legless Legolas, located on Channel Street Upper, is reputedly the oldest pub in Dublin. This statement presents an alternative proposition about which pub holds the title of the oldest in the city. Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement implies the truth of another statement. In this case, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise because accepting the premise as true does not automatically imply that the hypothesis is true as well. Instead, the two statements make competing claims about the oldest pub in Dublin. If the premise is accepted as true, it would still be unknown whether the Legless Legolas is older or younger than the Brazen Head. Similarly, if the hypothesis is accepted as true, the age of the Brazen Head relative to the Legless Legolas would still be uncertain. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the truth of one statement does not guarantee the truth of the other. The two claims are independent of each other, and additional information or evidence would be needed to verify the truth of either the premise or the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: It is difficult to convey the excitement I first felt when it was revealed that His Holiness Pope Francis was invited to Washington D.C. to address the world from the floor of the House of Representatives. Many believed, like I did, that this was an opportunity for the Pope to be one of the world’s great religious advocates and address the current intolerance of religious freedom. An opportunity to urgently challenge governments to properly address the persecution and execution of Christians and religious minorities; to address the heinous and senseless murders committed by ISIS and other terrorist organizations. An opportunity to address the enslavement, belittlement, rape and desecration of Christian women and children; to address the condoned, subsidized, intentionally planned genocide of unborn children by Planned Parenthood and society; and finally, an opportunity for His Holiness to refocus our priorities on right from wrong.            Media reports indicate His Holiness instead intends to focus the brunt of his speech on climate change--a climate that has been changing since first created in Genesis. More troubling is the fact that this climate change talk has adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into “climate justice” and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies. If the Pope stuck to standard Christian theology, I would be the first in line. If the Pope spoke out with moral authority against violent Islam, I would be there cheering him on. If the Pope urged the Western nations to rescue persecuted Christians in the Middle East, I would back him wholeheartedly. But when the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one. Artist and columnist Maureen Mullarkey effectively communicated this fallacy stating, “When papal preferences, masked in a Christian idiom, align themselves with ideological agendas (e.g. radical environmentalism) [they] impinge on democratic freedoms and the sanctity of the individual.”      The earth’s climate has been changing since God created it, with or without man. On that, we should all agree. In Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment (written with the consultation of that great seminary the EPA and its embattled head Gina McCarthy), he condemned anyone skeptical of the link between human activity and climate change and adopted the false science being propagated by the Left. If the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time. But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous.            Furthermore, I am a proud Catholic. I chose to attend a Jesuit college in the Midwest, not just for my undergraduate but also my graduate studies (D.D.S.). I received an excellent education where I was taught to think critically, to welcome debate and discussion and to be held accountable for my actions; a trademark of a Jesuit education. And finally, I am a Conservative, a member of Congress, a constitutionalist and adamant defender of our Republic; an American that believes in strict adherence to the rule of law and a firm believer in our First Amendment protections, in this particular discussion, the freedom of religion.      So at this pivotal moment in world history, His Holiness, Pope Francis, is intending to spend the majority of his time on one of the world’s greatest stages focusing on climate change. I have both a moral obligation and leadership responsibility to call out leaders, regardless of their titles, who ignore Christian persecution and fail to embrace opportunities to advocate for religious freedom and the sanctity of human life. If the Pope plans to spend the majority of his time advocating for flawed climate change policies, then I will not attend. It is my hope that Pope Francis realizes his time is better spent focusing on matters like religious tolerance and the sanctity of all life. As the leader of the Catholic Church, and as a powerful voice for peace throughout the world, His Holiness has a real opportunity to change the climate of slaughter in the Middle East… not the fool’s errand of climate change. ||||| Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican and a Catholic, said Friday he will boycott next week’s address to Congress by Pope Francis because he believes the pope will focus on climate change instead of “religious tolerance and the sanctity of life.”      Gosar published an op-ed on the conservative news site Townhall:      “I have both a moral obligation and leadership responsibility to call out leaders, regardless of their titles, who ignore Christian persecution and fail to embrace opportunities to advocate for religious freedom and the sanctity of human life.”      The he dismissed the pope’s recent encyclical calling for swift action on climate change, saying the climate has been changing “since God created it, with or without man … If the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time. But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous.”      Gosar added, “When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one.”      The congressman reiterated those concerns to reporters Friday afternoon, saying he will not attend “without assurances” the pope would not focus his comments on climate change. He said “there are others that have gone to Rome to ask him to talk about the genocide that is occurring,” but it is clear that “he’s going to talk about climate change.”      While Gosar was the only congressman saying he would boycott the speech, he was not the only one raising concerns about the pope’s choice of topics.      Rep. John Fleming, R-La., told USA TODAY on Friday, “What I’m a little concerned about is that the pope seems to distract at times from some of the most important issues of faith — which is life — and he talks about issues like climate change.” The pope has “made some statements that would suggest that there may be certain level of acceptance of abortion,” Fleming said, and he would like to see the pope use his remarks to “re-emphasize the importance of protecting life and preventing abortion.” ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was:      - Slash pages from every domain on the web:                  -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links)            -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain      - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph ||||| Summary:","output":"The article describes the excitement felt when Pope Francis was invited to Washington D.C. to address the world from the House of Representatives.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How did Burke know so much about Rousseau?\\" is in \\"In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Burke knew so much about Rousseau primarily because he was a contemporary thinker and a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed during his visit to Britain in 1766-1767. Burke was well-versed in Rousseau's works and ideas, and he critically engaged with them in his writings, such as \\"A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly,\\" published in April 1791. In this letter, Burke criticized Rousseau and his influence on the French Revolution. He acknowledged that Rousseau had \\"a considerable insight into human nature,\\" but also accused him of being driven by vanity and having a life filled with \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" without any virtues or good actions. Burke's knowledge of Rousseau came from his intellectual engagement with his works and ideas as well as his connection to people who knew Rousseau personally, such as David Hume."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The review provided for the DVD titled \\"A buddy film - a disappointing DVD\\" is predominantly negative. The reviewer had specific expectations from the documentary and was seeking objective information about crop circles, but the DVD failed to deliver that. Instead, the content of the DVD primarily focuses on a conversation between Peter Robbins and Colin Andrews, touching upon conspiracies, cover-ups, and personal mistakes. The reviewer finds this chatty interview format to be not very informative and lacks the insightful information they were hoping to gain about crop circles. The DVD, in their opinion, does not manage to live up to their expectations as an objective documentary.

Both dishes were fresh and full of flavor. As for the main course, I had the veal saltimbocca, which was cooked to perfection, and my partner opted for their homemade seafood linguine. We were extremely impressed not only by the delicious tastes but also by the presentation of the dishes. The staff at Luigi's was incredibly attentive, making sure our water glasses were always full and frequently checking in to ensure we were satisfied with our meals. Our server, Maria, offered excellent wine pairings and even treated us to a complimentary tiramisu for our anniversary. The dim lighting and soft background music created the perfect ambiance for a romantic dinner.

He accumulated a total of 5,714 strikeouts throughout his illustrious career, a record which still stands to this day. Born on January 31, 1947, in Refugio, Texas, his full name is Lynn Nolan Ryan Jr. Nolan Ryan's career spanned over 27 years, making him one of the longest-tenured players in the history of MLB. He played for four different teams throughout his career: the New York Mets (from 1966 to 1971), the California Angels (from 1972 to 1979), the Houston Astros (from 1980 to 1988), and the Texas Rangers (from 1989 to 1993). Ryan became an eight-time All-Star, and his pitching prowess earned him the nickname \\"The Ryan Express.\\" Some of Ryan's other impressive records and achievements include: - Seven no-hitters, the most by any pitcher in MLB history. - Twelve one-hitters, tied for the second-most in MLB history. - Eighteen two-hitters, the most in MLB history. - 324 wins, ranking 14th in MLB history. - 3.19 career earned run average (ERA). - 6,986 innings pitched, the seventh most in MLB history. Nolan Ryan's exceptional feat of having the most career strikeouts can be attributed to his incredible fastball, which regularly reached velocities of over 100 miles per hour (160 km/h). Ryan was known for his durability and longevity as a starting pitcher, as well as his exceptional control, which allowed him to strike out a significant number of batters he faced.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person in whose foot was blood poisoning? is inside the article: As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly.

His latest book, 100 Heartbeats: The Race to Save Earth's Most Endangered Species, showcases his passion for preserving wildlife by bringing attention to the dire circumstances many species face and the urgent need to act. Corwin's job, as he described it, involves traveling the world, observing animals, and sharing their stories with the aim of fostering a deeper appreciation and understanding of the importance of conservation. His fascination with wildlife began at a young age when he encountered a wild snake at the age of six. This formative experience inspired him to pursue a life connected with nature, which eventually led him to become a prominent writer and advocate for wildlife conservation. Writing the book 100 Heartbeats was a natural extension of Corwin's commitment to conserving biodiversity across the globe. He observed that we are losing species at an alarming rate and felt compelled to raise awareness about this devastating loss and to inspire individuals and organizations to take action to conserve what remains. Through captivating stories and compelling evidence, Corwin calls attention to the plight of the world's most endangered species and the urgent need for change. One of the key points Corwin emphasizes is the undeniable role humans play in the endangerment of these species. Our actions, both directly and indirectly, have a significant impact on the survival and well-being of countless animals and ecosystems.

I remember being terrified of movie blood when I was younger, and gradually getting less so, until getting jaded enough, as I'm sure many other viewers have become, so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm. \\"The Dentist\\" turned that around. The setup seems simple: a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths, and perhaps bodies as well. A clever twist, though, is that the dentist is the film's protagonist, so instead of being some one-dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation, his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable. The viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims, and instead of hoping for justice to come to him, I found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life. What really \\"makes\\" a horror movie is the violence. And \\"The Dentist\\" does it better than any other film I can think of. First off, the film has tons of tension, which is something that modern gore films tend to lack. In one scene (), the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time. As he reaches into the child's mouth, you hope that, for the dentist's and the child's sake, the encounter ends without injury. I won't spoil what happens. Second, when the gore does come, it hits all the worst, squirmy nerves. Once again, I won't give anything away. Of course, being a movie that you've never heard of, it does have flaws. Most importantly, it's exclusively for horror fans. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, by taking place over a span of just a few days, we don't really get any background on the characters. And the tension drops a little bit during the very end. But really, the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is, and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgiven. It's strange, after years of being accustomed to movie gore, to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood. \\"The Dentist\\" made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable, and for this it earns my full approval. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as positive with a few mild criticisms.

Q:Movie Extras Would you mind lying in a coffin  ? Would you shave your head? Are you willing to take out your false teeth? These are just a few of the questions Anne Marie Stewart and her staff sometimes ask the \\"talent\\" who serve as non-speaking \\"extras\\" in special films, television series, and made-for-TV movies produced in Toronto. Of course, the majority of extra calls are for more ordinary people, and Stewart has a list of about 650 registered extras. Crowd scenes, which are common, call for everyday people of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, and sizes. Over at Movie People, last-minute requests are not unusual. \\"We got a request once for an entire brass band of 30 people. They wanted it within the hour,\\" said manager Yvonne McCartney. Another time, the company got a last-minute request for a newborn baby. \\"We found a baby that was three weeks premature,\\" said Jonathan Aiken, an owner of the company. Then there was the worried call from a casting director whose \\"Star\\" got doggone stubborn one day and decided to just lie down and not work. The director needed a replacement dog, fast. \\"We got them two in one hour.\\" said Aiken. \\"It was a matter of good connections and fast phone work.\\" The eight phone lines needed to make 350 to 400 calls a day are one of Movie People's major expenses. Phone lines are the only way to stay in touch with casting directors and extras; but the latter are a group not necessarily interested in a long-term relationship. Most extra jobs pay only 7 an hour (with a six-hour minimum), while most agencies charge an annual 75 registration fee and get 10 to 15 per cent of extras' earnings. It's no wonder that the  _ rate is fairly high. Some people who are between jobs do extra work as a temporary measure, said McCartney. But professionals, such as lawyers, also do the work because it's interesting. Others with flexible jobs have a desire to do something different. Some homemakers want to get out of the house and onto a movie set. Money's not the motivating reason. \\"One of the first things... According to the passage, movie extras should   _  .

Article: Of the estimated 8.8 million Jews living in Europe at the beginning of World War II, the majority of whom were Ashkenazi, about 6 million – more than two-thirds – were systematically murdered in the Holocaust. These included 3 million of 3.3 million Polish Jews (91%); 900,000 of 1.5 million in Ukraine (60%); and 50–90% of the Jews of other Slavic nations, Germany, Hungary, and the Baltic states, and over 25% of the Jews in France. Sephardi communities suffered similar depletions in a few countries, including Greece, the Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia. As the large majority of the victims were Ashkenazi Jews, their percentage dropped from nearly 92% of world Jewry in 1931 to nearly 80% of world Jewry today. The Holocaust also effectively put an end to the dynamic development of the Yiddish language in the previous decades, as the vast majority of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, around 5 million, were Yiddish speakers.

Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in a pristine print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie. Unfortunately, that is not saying much. It has a competent cast of second-rankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances. It is efficiently directed, entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot. It looks OK, but is ponderously over-plotted and at a scant 80 minutes it is still heavily padded. For example, the double cobra attack on the first of the GIs was surely one attack too many. The business about Julia choosing to marry Pete rather than Tom never amounts to anything. Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of Julia (nor is she). Julia's 'feminine intuition' is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development, but it doesn't. Similarly, Pete's investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on Tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time. These are just symptoms of the underlying problem. The movie is structured like a mystery but it isn't. As soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading, so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already know. The ending is particularly lame. Julia is menaced purely by accident. Lisa has no reason to want to kill her - she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom turns up in the nick of time to save her, it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all. He then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done. It is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that I found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads. Then it occurred to me. Someone said: \\"Those Val Lewton movies were very successful over at RKO, so why don't we make one like that?\\" Cult of the Cobra is clearly modelled on Cat People: mysterious, troubled, shape-shifting woman falls in love with the hero, is apparently frigid, kills people, arouses the suspicions of the hero's woman friend and dies at the end. But 'modelled on' doesn't mean 'as good as' - by a wide margin. It copies, but doesn't understand what it is copying. It is obviously trying for the low-key, suggestive Lewton style, but this approach doesn't follow through into the story. Lisa is no Irene. She is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her. We get a glimpse of her after the first attack in Asia, so immediately recognise her when she turns up in New York. There is never any doubt about her purpose. Neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake. Then again, during her nocturnal prowling we get, not one, but two attempts at 'buses'. Neither come off, because the director doesn't understand what makes a 'bus' work and, in any case, they happen to the stalker, not the person being stalked. These faint echoes of Cat People give Cult of the Cobra whatever small distinction it might have, but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitation. Plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I doubt if Lewton or Tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little time-passer came out. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought negatively of the movie.

Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and two other federal employees may have broken as many as six laws as they commuted frequently between Washington and Mr. Long’s home in Hickory, N.C., at taxpayers’ expense, said one of the people briefed on the investigation.      ... ||||| The actions by Brock Long, the U.S. government’s lead disaster official as the country braces for Hurricane Florence, have been called into question by the inspector general over whether taxpayers have inappropriately footed the bill for his travel. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images White House Trump’s FEMA chief under investigation over use of official cars The lead disaster official for Hurricane Florence recently clashed with his boss, Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, over travel home to North Carolina.      Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long is the target of an ongoing Department of Homeland Security inspector general investigation into whether he misused government vehicles during his commutes to North Carolina from Washington, according to three people familiar with the matter, including current and former administration officials.      The actions by Long, the U.S. government’s lead disaster official as the country braces for Hurricane Florence, have been called into question by the inspector general over whether taxpayers have inappropriately footed the bill for his travel, an issue that has tripped up a number of current and former top Trump administration officials.      Story Continued Below      Long’s travel habits triggered a clash between him and his boss, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, in recent weeks, clouding their relationship just as senior aides close to President Donald Trump prepared for hurricane season — a task that’s attracted extra scrutiny in the wake of the disaster that befell Puerto Rico in the aftermath of last year’s Hurricane Maria.

Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.      The IG is investigating whether Long misused government resources and personnel on trips back home to Hickory, North Carolina, on the weekends, said two of the officials. The IG’s interest was drawn after one of the vehicles — a black Suburban — was involved in an accident, according to one of the officials.      Long’s routine absences from the office due to frequent six-hour drives between North Carolina and Washington also drew Nielsen’s attention, this person said. Nielsen had raised the issue of Long’s in-office schedule with him in recent months, this person added.      At a meeting in late August, Nielsen confronted Long about his travel, though people familiar with the meeting gave conflicting accounts about whether she took the step of asking him to step down over the issue.      One of the officials said Nielsen asked Long to consider resigning, though he declined to do so and remains in his role. The program to support the FEMA administrator “was never intended for this purpose,” said the official.      Long did not respond to requests for comment from POLITICO but addressed the IG investigation at a FEMA briefing on Thursday morning, saying his office was working closely with the inspector general’s office “to make improvements to make sure we are running programs and policies according to regulation.”      “Bottom line is, we’ll continue to fully cooperate with any investigation that goes on and own up to any mistakes and push forward and keep going,” Long said.      “I would never intentionally run a program incorrectly,“ he added. “Doing something unethical is not part of my DNA, and it is not part of my track record in my whole entire career. We will work with the OIG.”      Jessica Nalepa, FEMA’s director of external affairs, said questions about specific IG investigations should be directed to DHS’ IG office and that FEMA fully cooperates with all investigations conducted by the IG. The DHS IG’s office and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.      “All questions about any potential investigation by the Office of the Inspector General should be directed to the IG. At this time, we are fully focused on preparing for, responding to, and recovering from Hurricane Florence and the storms in the Pacific,” said DHS press secretary Tyler Houlton. “The secretary is confident in the leadership at FEMA and their proven disaster management ability.”      Long started using a staff driver to get him home to North Carolina at the beginning of his tenure at FEMA last year. On the weekends Long spent in North Carolina, aides were put up in a hotel at taxpayer expense, according to one of the current officials.      DHS employees must be authorized to access government vehicles for personal use, including travel to a residence outside Washington, according to one of the officials. But a former DHS official said Long, as administrator, is entitled to have a contingency aide accompany him so he can have secure communications in case of a national emergency.      The former official added that Long “never asked for it and believed access to secure communications to be part of a presidential directive.” FEMA recently scaled back the use of the contingency team for cost-saving purposes, and Long now drives himself or flies to North Carolina.      Former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, who served under President Barack Obama, said he could remember using government cars for commuting purposes only in seven instances during the eight years he held the job. In those emergency or extreme cases, Fugate said, it was deemed appropriate for a FEMA aide to brief him face-to-face as a driver took him from his home in Gainesville, Florida, to the Jacksonville airport for outbound flights to Washington, where his presence was required.      Long previously worked at an emergency management consulting firm and also served as director of Alabama’s Emergency Management Agency.      The Trump administration has come under intense criticism for its response to the damage Hurricane Maria did to Puerto Rico. Almost 3,000 people died in the natural disaster, many more than the earlier official tally of 64 people. Trump said this week that his government’s response to the disaster in Puerto Rico “was an incredible, unsung success.”      Marc Caputo and Rebecca Morin contributed to this report.       ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the government's disaster relief agency says he has no intention of stepping aside, especially during Florence, despite being under investigation by a federal watchdog.      Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long says, \\"I'm here to serve my country every day. That's all I do. And when it's over, whenever it ends, I'm ready to go back home, love my family.\\"      Long says Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen (KEER'-sten) Nielsen \\"has never asked me to resign\\" from FEMA.

Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek was a source of power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek led to the development of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within 22 miles (35 km) of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were steam powered (the rest were water powered). The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On May 2, 1872, a large forest fire destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, 6 miles (9.7 km) north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township. There are large tracts of second growth forest and small lumber companies still operate in the watershed today.

Article: It's true that many dads in the wild aren't interested in parenting, but there are some that work pretty hard to give their little ones a good start. Maybe one of these dads will make you remember your own dad! The male giant water bug doesn't seem to mind a heavy load on his back for his kids. The female puts about 100 to 150 eggs on the back of the male, and then she leaves. Once the female is gone, the male has to look after the eggs. It usually takes one to two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The father giant water bug jumps around to make sure the growing eggs get enough air and water. All this time he can't fly because of the weight of the eggs growing rapidly on his back. Now let's turn to the male stickleback fish. When the mother leaves after laying her eggs, the father tends his young. If the young fish go too far away, their father helps with their safe return by carrying them back in his mouth. The male stickleback looks after all his young -- as many as 100 -- until they can live on their own. A similar example can be found in emperor penguins living in cold areas. The male emperor penguin goes without food while looking after his egg until it hatches. For about 62 to 67 days, the egg stays on top of the father's feet, in very cold temperatures that drop down to -39deg C. As a result, the father may lose nearly 50 percent of his body weight while waiting for his baby penguin to be born! Question: What is the best title for the text?

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Based on the article, the tax plan is likely to: Options:  A. Pass without any resistance  B.

Despite her successful career, supportive family, and close-knit group of friends, she's ready to find her soulmate. The journey takes her through unexpected twists, turns, and hilarious escapades as she searches for love in the city. Plot: Myra starts by trying various dating apps and websites, hoping technology will come to her rescue. Her best friend, Sarah, always by her side, encourages her by offering to help Myra create the perfect online profile. Myra delves into the world of superficial photo swaps and clichéd one-liners while navigating the modern dating scene. However, her encounters with potential suitors all lead to comical yet unsatisfactory experiences. Growing frustrated with the dating app world, Myra embarks on other methods to find her partner. She attends speed dating events recommended by her coworkers, where she meets various interesting characters. One of her dates, Alex, is a charming but eccentric artist who believes in drawing his date's portrait as a means of knowing their soul. Another is Linda, a lovelorn entrepreneur vocally embittered with failed past relationships but potentially a good match. Myra ends up becoming friends with a few of the people but can't seem to find her true soulmate. One day, taking a break from her busy dating life, she visits a quaint local bookstore, only to have a chance encounter with Sam, the friendly barista from the attached café. Sam is warm, intellectual, and shares Myra's love for architecture and design. Their initial conversation sparks chemistry, and they begin spending more time together, bonding over shared hobbies and experiences. While Myra feels a strong connection with Sam, she questions if their relationship will fulfill her soulmate criteria. After all, she wasn't actively searching at the time of their meeting, and Sam was never part of her calculated plans. Her hesitation causes tension between them. Sarah, watching Myra's journey unfold, reminds her that love can't always be neatly contained in a box or adhere to a list of requirements. Myra takes Sarah's advice to heart and realizes that her search for love should prioritize her own happiness and feelings of connection, rather than checking off boxes on her expected list. With newfound clarity and renewed determination, Myra decides to follow her heart, realizing that Sam could potentially be her soulmate after all. With her characteristic spontaneity, Myra surprises Sam with a heartfelt declaration of love and a request for their partnership in life. In a tearjerker moment, Sam reciprocates the affection, and the two come together as a true romantic pair. In the end, Myra learns that the search for a soulmate isn't always a linear journey. Love could be found in unexpected places, and sometimes it's necessary to let go of preconceived notions and risk it all for a chance at genuine happiness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was not formally trained but gifted? ?  At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...

The road from Thusis through Bergün leads to La Punt in the Inn Valley (Engadin).  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - The Albula Alps are a mountain range in the Alps of eastern Switzerland. They are considered to be part of the Central Eastern Alps, more specifically the Western Rhaetian Alps. They are named after the river Albula. The Albula Alps are separated from the Oberhalbstein Alps in the west by the Septimer Pass and the valley of the Sursés; from the Plessur Alps in the north-west by the Landwasser valley; from the Silvretta group in the north-east by the Flüela Pass; from the Bernina Range in the south-east by the Maloja Pass and the Inn valley (upper Engadine).  - Piz Julier (German) is a mountain of the Albula Alps, overlooking the Julier Pass, in the Swiss canton of Graubünden.

He had always been self-conscious about his height but had learned to adapt to it over the years. Steven, on the other hand, towered over most people at a striking 6'5\\". The two of them made an unusual pair but were inseparable since childhood. Despite their contrasting heights, Derrick and Steven shared an uncommon bond, forged through a shared love for adventure and a curious spirit. They would often embark on thrilling escapades, exploring hidden caves, abandoned buildings, and forgotten trails in the woods near their hometown. One summer evening, as the sun dipped behind the treetops, the duo stumbled upon a peculiar, moss-covered door in the heart of the forest. Their curiosity piqued, they couldn't resist pushing the door open to reveal what lay inside. To their astonishment, they discovered an ancient, labyrinthine library filled with dusty, leatherbound books. Derrick, an avid reader, excitedly started perusing the shelves as Steven followed close behind, his tall frame nearly brushing the cobwebs that dangled from the high ceilings. They found that the library extended beyond what was visible, with bookshelf-lined corridors spiralling deeper into the unknown. As they delved further into the building, the friends encountered books written in languages they couldn't comprehend and found themselves surrounded by an eerie silence. \\"Who do you think built this library?\\" murmured Derrick, his voice barely a whisper. \\"I have no idea,\\" replied Steven, \\"but there must be a reason why it's hidden in the middle of the forest.\\" In their exploration, they stumbled upon a dimly lit room that seemed to serve as the library's core. A large wooden table sat in the center, scarred by time and bearing the weight of a single, weathered tome. They approached the table cautiously, and Derrick gingerly opened the ancient book. The moment the book's cover lifted, a sudden gust of wind swirled through the library, carrying with it an unsettling air that seemed to emanate from the pages themselves. The book, bound by a thick metal clasp, was written in an undecipherable script. However, in the middle of the book, there was a detailed, hand-drawn map unlike any they had ever seen. Steven traced his finger along the intricately drawn passages, pausing as his eyes locked onto an unmistakable symbol at the map's heart – a golden chalice. Rumors had long circulated in their town about a mythical treasure rumored to lie hidden in the woods, known as the Chalice of Evermore. No one had found it, and many believed it to be a mere legend. But the map suggested otherwise. Derrick and Steven exchanged a mix of disbelief and excitement. The treasure they had grown up hearing about was now within their grasp. They made an unspoken pact to embark on this grand adventure, setting aside the unexpected fear lingering in the air. After all, what was one more escapade for the daring duo? With the mysterious map in hand, the two friends left the eerie library and ventured back into the woods. Guided by the cryptic symbols and intricate illustrations, they were determined to decipher the legend and uncover the secrets of the Chalice of Evermore. Their journey would take them through treacherous terrains, ancient ruins, and dark secrets long-hidden within their own town. Along the way, they would learn about camaraderie, trust, and the incredible power of the human spirit. Little did they know that this legendary treasure hunt would change their lives forever, bringing them closer as friends and awakening within them a shared destiny that would span across generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I can use this background: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Now, I have a new situation: Two friends met after 20 years and compared diets. Paul ate junk food daily and weighed 300 lbs and was 5'8'' in height. Mike was vegan and stayed healthy and thin.  Answer this question please: Which friend had less unused energy in food? Answer:","output":"Before determining which friend had less unused energy in food, let's first calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) to understand their health status. For Paul: Height: 5'8\\" = 1.7272 meters (rounded to four decimal points) Weight: 300 lbs = 136.078 kg (rounded to three decimal points, using the conversion rate 1 lb = 0.453592 kg) BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2 BMI_Paul = 136.078 kg / (1.7272 m)^2 BMI_Paul ≈ 45.6 For Mike: Since Mike is described as healthy and thin, assume that he has a BMI within the normal range (18.5 - 24.9). Now, let's discuss their diets in further detail: Paul's diet mainly consists of junk food. Junk food is typically high in calories, unhealthy fats, sugars, and salt, which can lead to weight gain and stored energy in the form of body fat when consumed in excess. On the other hand, Mike follows a vegan diet. A vegan diet generally consists of vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, which provide a balance of nutrients and typically fewer calories compared to junk food. By staying healthy and thin, we can infer that Mike consumes an appropriate amount of food energy to maintain his energy balance and has less excess body fat. Answer: The friend with less unused energy in food is Mike. His vegan diet, rich in nutrient-dense, lower-calorie foods, allows him to maintain a healthier weight and energy balance. On the other hand, Paul's consumption of high-calorie junk food has likely resulted in a more significant amount of excess stored body fat and unused energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Menominee Indian Reservation is located in northeastern Wisconsin. For the most part, it is conterminous with Menominee County and the town of Menominee, which were established after termination of the tribe in 1961 under contemporary federal policy whose goal was assimilation. The tribe regained its federally recognized status and reservation in 1975.  The reservation was created in a treaty with the United States signed on May 12, 1854 in which the Menominee relinquished all claims to the lands held by them under previous treaties, and were assigned 432 square miles (1,120 km2) on the Wolf River in present-day Wisconsin. An additional treaty, which they signed on February 11, 1856, carved out the southwestern corner of this area to create a separate reservation for the Stockbridge and Lenape (Munsee) tribes, who had reached the area as refugees from New York state. The latter two tribes have the federally recognized joint Stockbridge-Munsee Community.  After the tribe had regained federal recognition in 1973, it essentially restored the reservation to its historic boundaries in 1975. Many small pockets of territory within the county (and its geographically equivalent town) are not considered as part of the reservation. These amount to 1.14% of the county's area, so the reservation is essentially 98.86% of the county's area. The largest of these pockets is in the western part of the community of Keshena, Wisconsin. The reservation includes a plot of off-reservation trust land of 10.22 acres (41,400 m2) in Winnebago County, Wisconsin to the south, west of the city of Oshkosh. The reservation's total land area is 353.894 sq mi (916.581 km2), while Menominee County's land area is 357.960 sq mi (927.11 km2).  The small non-reservation parts of the county are more densely populated than the reservation, holding 1,337 (29.3%) of the county's 4,562 total population, as opposed to the reservation's 3,225 (70.7%) population, as of the 2000 census.  The most populous communities are Legend Lake and Keshena. Since the late 20th century, the members of the reservation have operated a number of gambling facilities in these communities as a source of revenue. They speak English as well as their traditional Menominee language, one of the Algonquian languages. Current population of the tribe is about 8,700. Answer this question \\"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article. One aspect is the history of the Menominee Indian Reservation, which was created through treaties signed with the United States in 1854 and 1856. These treaties assigned lands to the Menominee and set aside separate lands for the Stockbridge and Lenape tribes, who had relocated to the region as refugees. Another interesting aspect is the Menominee tribe's journey to regain federal recognition in 1973 and the restoration of their reservation in 1975. This highlights the tribe's resilience and determination to preserve their identity and rights. Additionally, the article mentions the presence of small, non-reservation pockets of land within the county, which constitutes a very small percentage of the total area. It highlights the difference in population density between the reservation and non-reservation areas. The Menominee tribe has also successfully leveraged gambling facilities in the communities of Legend Lake and Keshena as a source of revenue. Furthermore, the article emphasizes the importance of the Menominee language, which is part of the Algonquian language family, and the current population of the tribe, which stands at approximately 8,700."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following article and select the best answer.

To remove the extra glue, follow these steps: 1. Wait for the mastic to dry: It's easier to remove it when it's dry, just like when you're peeling off dried glue from your fingers. 2. Use a plastic scraper: Get a plastic scraper, like a toy beach shovel or a piece of an old plastic toy. Gently scrape off the extra glue from the mirror's back, being careful not to scratch or break the mirror. 3. Go slowly: Remember, we don't want to damage our mirror. Take your time and gently remove the glue, little by little. 4. Clean up: Once you've removed most of the extra glue, you can use a soft cloth or even a wet wipe to clean up anything left behind. This will make the mirror look all nice and tidy. And there you go! With these steps, you can accomplish the goal of removing excess mirror mastic.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Blondie had 4 songs on at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Clashs song \\"Rock the Casbah\\" went to number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 22 January 1983. The Clashs album Combat Rock was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 10 January 1983 was later certified 2x platinum by the RIAA in 1995. Men at Works albums Business as Usual (Men at Work album) and Cargo (album) were certified 4x platinum by the RIAA on 19 October 1984 and 2x platinum by the RIAA on 19 October 1984, respectively. Men at Works song \\"Who Can It Be Now?\\" peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1982 and the bands song \\"Down Under (song)\\" peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1983.

Men at Works album Business as Usual peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200 on 13 November 1982 and was at number 1 on the chart from 13 November 1982 – 19 February 1983. How many months was Business as Usual at the top of the Billboard chart?","output":"To find the number of months Business as Usual was at the top of the Billboard chart, we need to calculate the time period between 13 November 1982 and 19 February 1983. 1. Start with the whole months:    - There is one whole month from 13 November to 13 December.    - From 13 December to 13 January, there is another whole month.    - Hence, we have two whole months from November and December. 2. Now, let's consider the remaining time period from 13 January to 19 February:    - From 13 January to 19 February, there are 7 days in January (from January 13 to January 19) and 19 days in February (from February 1 to February 19). 3. Calculate the total number of days and convert it to months:    - There are 7 days from January and 19 days from February, totaling 26 days.    - Since one month is approximately 30 days, we can consider this as 26/30 ≈ 0.87 months (rounded to two decimal places). 4. Add the whole months and the partial month:    - Total months at the top of the chart = 2 (whole months) + 0.87 (partial month) = 2.87 months (rounded to two decimal places). Based on the context provided, Business as Usual was at the top of the Billboard chart for approximately 2.87 months."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

And I was wondering What will Sasha want to do next? Answer:","output":"Sasha might be considering their options now. Let me break down the thought process for each choice: 1. Lie about stealing the money:    - Sasha might think that lying will save them from getting caught or facing consequences.    - However, lying can lead to more problems down the line if the truth comes out or if they are caught in the lie. 2. Wanted to avoid calling the police:    - Sasha might not want to involve the police, fearing that it could escalate the situation or lead to legal trouble.    - This choice could also stem from a personal dislike or distrust of the police. 3. Wanted Sasha to have a clean record:    - Sasha might be concerned about their future and the impact that a criminal record could have on their opportunities.    - This choice suggests that Sasha values their reputation and the opinions others have of them. Based on these considerations, Sasha might want to do one of the following: - If they are innocent, they should maintain their innocence and potentially provide an alibi if possible. - If they are guilty, they should carefully weigh the pros and cons of confessing or lying, keeping in mind that confession might lead to leniency or a chance to make amends while lying could lead to further consequences if the truth is revealed. - Additionally, they might consider talking to Jesse to negotiate an alternative to police involvement, such as returning the money or taking other steps to make amends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Children who are not taught these lessons pay the consequences for a life time. Some parents don't teach children about money because they think they shouldn't talk about money with children, don't have the time, or think they don't have enough money. Parents should take the time to teach children about money regardless of their income and should start when children are young. Most people have strong feelings and opinions about money, based on childhood experiences and the values and beliefs of their families. Most often, these experiences, values, and beliefs are different for each parent. It is important for the healthy development of children that parents talk about these feelings and opinions and establish a consistent approach to teaching children about money. Here are some guidelines parents can keep in mind as they begin the financial socialization of their children: Advise rather than order how the child's money should be used. Allow children to learn by mistakes and by successes. Be consistent while taking children's differences into account. Include all family members in money management discussions, decision making, and activities suitable for their age. Explan to children what they can and cannot do and the consequences of going above the limits. As children get older increasingly include them in discussions of limits and consequences. Expect all family members to perform unpaid, routine household work based on their abilities. Express your desire to have things you can't afford.

She learns that the three men are Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), Herman Scobie (George Kennedy), and Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass), the three survivors of a World War II OSS operation. Together with Charles and a fifth man, Carson Dyle, they were to deliver 250,000 in gold to the French Resistance, but they stole it instead. Dyle was fatally wounded in a German ambush, and Charles double-crossed the others and took all the gold. The three men want the missing money, and the U.S. government wants it back.

Movie title: On the Beach Context: During 1964, in the months following World War III, the conflict has devastated the Northern Hemisphere, polluting the atmosphere with nuclear fallout, killing all life there. Air currents are slowly carrying the fallout south; the only areas still habitable are in the far reaches of the Southern Hemisphere. From Australia, survivors detect an incomprehensible Morse code signal coming from the West Coast of the United States. The last American nuclear submarine, USS Sawfish, under Royal Australian Navy command, is ordered to sail north to the United States to attempt to make contact with the sender of the Morse signal. The submarine is commanded by Captain Dwight Towers (Gregory Peck), who must leave his new friend, the alcoholic Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner). The Australian government arranges for its citizens to receive suicide pills or prepared injections so they may end things quickly before there is prolonged suffering from radiation sickness. An Australian naval officer, Peter Holmes (Anthony Perkins) and his wife, Mary, who is in denial about the impending disaster, have a baby daughter. Assigned to travel with the American sub for several weeks, Peter tries to explain to Mary how to euthanize their baby and then kill herself in case he is not yet home when the end comes; Mary reacts very emotionally at the prospect of killing her daughter and herself. One scientist's theory is that the radiation level near the Arctic Ocean could be lower than that found at the mid-Northern Hemisphere, which might indicate the radiation could disperse before reaching the Southern Hemisphere. The theory is to be explored along with the submarine's main mission. After sailing to Point Barrow, Alaska, they determine that radiation levels are, on the contrary, intensifying.

An improved answer would be: Armenia began winning Olympic medals during the Soviet rule when it was a part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). As a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, Armenian athletes competed under the Soviet flag from 1952 to 1988 and contributed significantly to the USSR's victories in various Olympic competitions. These athletes participated in different sports, such as wrestling, gymnastics, weightlifting, boxing, and more. The first Armenian athlete to win an Olympic medal was Hrant Shahinyan, who secured two gold medals and two silvers in gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics held in Helsinki. He set a milestone for Armenian athletes, who continued to perform exceptionally and secure many more victories in the subsequent years. Despite the Soviet breakup in 1991, Armenian athletes have continued their winning streak at the Olympic Games. Armenia gained full membership in the International Olympic Committee in 1993 and has been participating independently in the Summer and Winter Olympics since 1994 and 1998, respectively. Throughout 1994 to the present, Armenian athletes have won over twenty medals overall. Some of the most notable Armenian athletes who have won Olympic medals independently are Arsen Galstyan (2012, Judo), Hripsime Khurshudyan (2012, Weightlifting), Artur Aleksanyan (2012, 2016, Wrestling), and Simon Martirosyan (2016, Weightlifting). These successes marked a continuing legacy of Armenia's excellence in the Olympics and constantly evolving sports culture. In conclusion, Armenia started winning Olympic medals during the Soviet rule but has also maintained an impressive track record since gaining independence. This demonstrates the resilience, talent, and dedication of Armenian athletes and the ongoing commitments to fostering athletic excellence in the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Lake Placid Movie plot: In Lincoln County, Maine, a marine Fish and Game officer is attacked and bitten in half by something unseen in Black Lake. Sheriff Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson), Fish and Game officer Jack Wells (Bill Pullman), American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda), and mythology professor/crocodile enthusiast Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt) go to the lake to investigate.A series of strange events occur, including Kelly and Hank's canoe mysteriously flying into the air and flipping, the discovery of a severed toe and a severed Moose head, and the decapitation of a Fish and Game deputy. Later, as Hank and Hector argue, a giant saltwater crocodile leaps out of the water and drags a nearby bear into the lake. Jack, Kelly, and Hank visit Delores Bickerman (Betty White), one of few people living on the lake. After finding the deputy's severed head, they witness her feeding a blindfolded cow to the enormous crocodile. Delores reveals that she has been feeding the crocodile for years after it followed her husband home. It eventually killed him. She is placed under house arrest for initially lying to the police.Hector decides to take one of Hank's deputies (Meredith Salenger) on a trip in the helicopter, and lands the helicopter in the cove where the crocodile lives. While he is diving, it attacks him, but he escapes. Jack and Hank plan to allow Florida Fish and Game to kill the crocodile when they arrive, but Hector suggests instead that he lure it out of the water and drug it. Jack reluctantly accepts the proposal, and they use one of Delores' cows, dangled from the helicopter, as bait. After a few hours, the crocodile lunges at the cow. Hector pulls up, loses the cow, and crashes the helicopter into the lake. The crocodile comes on land and attacks Jack and Kelly. Kelly is knocked into the lake, but she makes it to the helicopter just in time.Despite Hector and Kelly's protests to let the animal live, Jack grabs a gun and shoots it. The gun is revealed to be a tranquilizer rifle. As Hector comes...

In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary.   - In philosophy and logic, an argument is a series of statements typically used to persuade someone of something or to present reasons for accepting a conclusion. The general form of an argument in a natural language is that of premises (typically in the form of propositions, statements or sentences) in support of a claim: the conclusion. The structure of some arguments can also be set out in a formal language, and formally defined \\"arguments\\" can be made independently of natural language arguments, as in math, logic, and computer science.  - Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities.  - Poe Ballantine ( born 1955 in Denver , Colorado ) is a fiction and nonfiction writer known for his novels and especially his essays , many of which appear in The Sun. His second novel , Decline of the Lawrence Welk Empire , won Foreword Magazine 's Book of the Year . The odd jobs , eccentric characters , boarding houses , buses , and beer that populate Ballantine 's work often draw comparisons to the life and work of Charles Bukowski and Jack Kerouac . One of Ballantine 's short stories , \`\` The Blue Devils of Blue River Avenue '' , was included in Best American Short Stories 1998 and one of his essays , \`\` 501 Minutes to Christ '' , appeared in Best American Essays 2006 . His essay \`\` Free Rent at the Totalitarian Hotel '' ( originally published in The Sun ) opened Best American Essays 2013 . Ballantine 's essays and short stories have also appeared in the Coal City Review , Kenyon Review , and Atlantic Monthly . He has guest blogged for PowellsBooks.Blog and Marion Roach Smith 's \`\` Writing Lessons . '' In 2013 Hawthorne Books & Literary Arts published Ballantine 's memoir , Love & Terror on the Howling Plains of Nowhere with an introduction by Cheryl Strayed . Praised by Bruce Jacobs in Shelf Awareness as a \`\` funny memoir and ' true crime ' mashup by one of the country 's best vagabond raconteurs '' and by Cheryl Strayed as \`\` his best book ever '' , the memoir follows Ballantine 's interest in the disappearance of a professor from the town of Chadron , Nebraska .

The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument  but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by \\"serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\\" whereas the informal essay is characterized by \\"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\\" etc.  - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.  - A novella is a work of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel. The English word \\"\\"novella\\" derives from the Italian \\"novella\\", feminine of \\"novello\\", which means \\"new\\". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages.  - Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the creative ability to form images, ideas, and sensations in the mind without direct input from the senses, such as seeing or hearing. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to \\"evoke worlds\\".  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - A pamphlet is an unbound booklet (that is, without a hard cover or binding). It may consist of a single sheet of paper that is printed on both sides and folded in half, in thirds, or in fourths, called a \\"leaflet\\", or it may consist of a few pages that are folded in half and saddle stapled at the crease to make a simple book.  - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.  - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.  - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - Henry Charles Bukowski (born Heinrich Karl Bukowski; August 16, 1920  March 9, 1994) was a German-born American poet, novelist, and short story writer.  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.

Do you know why things burn? It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change. So yes, temperature affects the rate that physical change occurs.  After reading the above, is \\"Chemical change in road\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What is the physical change in temperature we see during the summer and how does it occur?\\"?","output":"No, \\"Chemical change in road\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"What is the physical change in temperature we see during the summer and how does it occur?\\".  The correct answer is the physical change of water evaporating due to the increased temperature during the summer. During summer, the temperature increases, leading to higher rates of evaporation of water present on surfaces, such as roads. This process involves liquid water changing its state to water vapor, which is still water. As explained in the text, this evaporation, which occurs as a result of the higher temperature, is a physical change and not a chemical change. So, the physical change we see during the summer is the evaporation of water due to increased temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Including greens in your plant selection focuses on the garden utilization and the nutritional value that the garden will bring to your table. Step 3: Picking Your Vegetables Once you've decided to venture into vegetable gardening, it's time to pick your crops. Tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, and zucchini are some favorites among home gardeners. When picking your vegetables, considering factors like crop maturity time and care requirements can guide your choices to ensure a bountiful harvest. By being thoughtful about the vegetables you decide to grow, you cater to your dietary preferences and the specific requirements of each plant species, thus enhancing the chances of a successful yield. Step 4: Selecting Fast-Growing Flowers  Lastly, incorporating fast-growing flowers is a great idea to add an aesthetic appeal to your garden quickly. They not only bring color and vibrancy but also attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, aiding in your garden's health and productivity. Annuals like marigolds, petunias, and zinnias grow quickly and blossom throughout the season, bringing beauty to your garden almost instantly. The incorporation of fast-growing flowers adds a visual charm and element of dynamism to your garden, while also contributing to its ecosystem. In summary, creating the perfect garden involves a careful mix of desirable attributes – from the type of plants, nutrient-rich greens, preferred vegetables, to fast-growing flowers. Irrespective of your gardening goals or expertise level, these steps put you on the right path to cultivating a garden that is as beautiful as it is productive. With time, care, and proper selection, your garden will thrive, rewarding your hard work with bountiful yields or beautiful blooms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"A man throwing something.\\", is the sentence \\"A person throwing something.\\" a true sentence?","output":"The sentence \\"A person throwing something\\" can be considered a true sentence based on the sentence \\"A man throwing something.\\" This is because the term \\"person\\" acts as a broader term that encompasses \\"man.\\" In other words, the first sentence can be seen as a specific example or subset of the second sentence. To elaborate further, the two sentences contain similar actions and behaviors since both involve a subject \\"throwing something.\\" The only difference lies in the subject themselves. The first sentence uses the term \\"man,\\" which refers to an adult human male, while the second sentence uses the more generic and all-encompassing term \\"person,\\" which refers to any individual human being, regardless of their age or gender. When we compare the two sentences, it is clear that the second sentence includes the first one within its scope. In other words, if there is a \\"man throwing something,\\" then that man is, by definition, also a \\"person.\\" Thus, when the first sentence is true, the second sentence is also true. However, it is essential to note that the second sentence's truth does not guarantee the truth of the first sentence. For example, if the statement were \\"A woman throwing something\\" instead, the second sentence would still be true as a woman is also a person. Therefore, while the truth of the first sentence implies the truth of the second sentence, the reverse is not necessarily valid. In summary, based on the sentence \\"A man throwing something,\\" we can conclude that the sentence \\"A person throwing something\\" is a true sentence as it encompasses broader implications and includes the subject of the first sentence, the man, within its generalized definition of a person."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: John Charles Fremont or Fremont (January 21, 1813 - July 13, 1890) was an American explorer, politician, and soldier who, in 1856, became the first candidate of the Republican Party for the office of President of the United States. During the 1840s, when he led five expeditions into the American West, that era's penny press and admiring historians accorded Fremont the sobriquet The Pathfinder. During the Mexican-American War, Fremont, a major in the U.S. Army, took control of California from the California Republic in 1846. The state of Missouri took possession of the Pacific Railroad in February 1866, when the company defaulted in its interest payment. In June 1866 the state conveyed the company to Fremont in a private sale. He reorganized its assets as the Southwest Pacific Railroad in August, but less than a year later (June 1867), the railroad was repossessed by the state after Fremont was unable to pay the second installment of the purchase price. The Panic of 1873, caused by over speculation in the railroad industry, and the depression that followed, wiped out much of Fremont's remaining wealth. Their financial straits required the Fremonts to sell Pocaho in 1875, and to move back to New York City.  Fremont was appointed Governor of the Arizona Territory by President Rutherford B. Hayes and served from 1878 to 1881. He spent little time in Arizona, and was asked to resume his duties in person or resign; Fremont chose resignation. Destitute, the family depended on the publication earnings of his wife Jessie.  Fremont lived on Staten Island in retirement. In April 1890, he was reappointed as a major general and then added to the Army's retired list, an action taken to ease his financial condition by enabling him to qualify for a pension.  On Sunday, July 13, 1890, Fremont (age 77) died of peritonitis at his residence at 49 West Twenty-fifth Street in New York. His death was unexpected and his brief illness was not generally known. On Tuesday, July 8, Fremont had been affected by the heat of a particularly hot summer day. On Wednesday he came down with a chill and was confined to his bedroom. His symptoms progressed to peritonitis (an abdominal infection) which caused his death. At the time he died, Fremont was popularly known as the \\"Pathfinder of the Rocky Mountains\\". He was buried in Rockland Cemetery in Sparkill, New York. What else did he do later in life?","output":"Later in life, John Charles Fremont was appointed Governor of the Arizona Territory by President Rutherford B. Hayes and served from 1878 to 1881.

One day Obree is given a bicycle by his parents and we see Obree evading the bullies on his bike. The adult Obree is married with a child.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - downtown area - middle of town - large city - london - lot of people Answer:","output":"To ensure that the gallery is an equal distance from everyone, the most suitable option would be to place it in the middle of town. This answer is selected based on the reasoning discussed below. - Downtown area: While the downtown area might be a central location, it often refers to a specific part of the town where commercial and business activities are concentrated. It may not necessarily be the geographic center, and therefore, it may not be at an equal distance from everyone. - Middle of town: Positioning the gallery in the middle of town implies that it would be located at the geographical center of the town. This central location means that the gallery would be accessible to all inhabitants with relatively equal travel distances. Thus, this option helps to achieve the aim of equal convenience for everyone. - Large city: A large city refers to a vast geographic area and not a specific location within that city. Therefore, choosing a large city as the location for the gallery would not guarantee its equal accessibility for everyone. - London: Similar to the large city option, London is a specific city but does not indicate a location within the city that would ensure equal access for everyone. Furthermore, referring to a single city may not allow for equal access to individuals who do not reside in that city. - Lot of people: Placing the gallery in an area with a lot of people does not necessarily ensure equal access for everyone. A densely populated area might bring the gallery closer to more people, but it may also mean that individuals living in less populated areas need to travel a considerable distance to reach the gallery. In conclusion, placing the gallery in the middle of town ensures that it has a central location which is equally accessible for everyone. This option caters to the needs of all inhabitants and ensures that the gallery is as conveniently located as possible for the maximum number of people."},{"instruction":"- caps is 51 1 10 0    - nationalyears is 2010 -- 2014 2014 -- 2010 -- 2011 2011 -- 2012 2012 2013    - youthclubs is barreirense benfica      - birth date is 27 may 1994    - clubs is barreirense benfica → valencia -lrb- loan -rrb- valencia    - nationalcaps is 6 17 7 25 9 5    - currentclub is valencia    - caption is cancelo playing for portugal u19 in 2012    - height is 1.82    - nationalgoals is 0 1 0 1 0 0      - nationalteam is portugal u20 portugal u21 u16 portugal u17 portugal u18 portugal u19 portugal    - birth place is barreiro , portugal    - position is right back    - fullname is joão pedro cavaco cancelo    - image size is 200    - years is 2005 2015 -- -- 2008 2008 -- 2012 2014 -- 2015    - clubnumber is 2    - youthyears is 2005 -- 2008 2008 -- 2012    - image is joão cancelo -lrb- 5 -rrb- . jpg    - goals is 3 0 0 0    Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Since it appears to be a part of a narrative, I believe the user wants me to continue or respond to the story.  To proceed, I will have to: Step 1: Understand the context: The sentence suggests a problem of mice in a castle, which the previous ruler used to solve by paying. There's a character named Tom who argues for bringing in mice, which is considered as an unorthodox position since castle-owners don't usually do this. Bert is another character, who has an opinion about someone named Lenchen, who he doesn't consider crazy. Step 2: Create a response adhering to the context: Since there is no concrete task, I'll continue the narrative based on what I could glean from the context. Here is the continuation of the story: Even when Tom proposed his latest theory about how the mice could serve as a deterrent to other, bigger vermin, Bert just shook his head. \\"Lenchen’s sanity is not in question here, Tom,\\" Bert grumbled. \\"It's her willingness to forego tradition that baffles me. The vermin problem could be dealt with in other ways.\\" He stared at the walls of the castle, mulling over how Lenchen's approach to pest control was about to change the castle’s legacy, adding a bizarre chapter to its mighty history. Lenchen, on the other hand, remained firm in her decision, her face calm in the face of such strong opposition.

By day, she works as a waitress at a small café, unassuming and unnoticed by most. By night, however, she takes on the role of a prostitute in an effort to save up enough money to escape the seedy underbelly of the city. As she goes about her grim routine, Iris forms a surprising connection with a kind-hearted detective, James, who frequents the café on his lunch breaks. Unaware of her night job, he slowly becomes infatuated with her. One fateful evening, while on a case, he discovers Iris's secret life and is conflicted about his feelings. Though initially disgusted by her profession, James learns about Iris's painful past and the reasons behind her choice to enter the world of prostitution. He understands that Iris is a lost soul simply trying to survive in a harsh environment and make her dreams a reality while grappling with long-held insecurities and trauma. As the two grow closer, Iris shares with James her dream of leaving Velmont, opening her own bakery in a quiet town, and living a normal, peaceful life. Touched by her aspirations, James becomes determined to not only catch the criminals he regularly takes down but also save Iris from her hazardous lifestyle. Meanwhile, a dangerous mob boss named Vincent takes an interest in Iris, wanting to profit from her beauty and vulnerability. He plots to control her and several other young women by forcing them into his illegal prostitution ring. James, now obsessed with protecting Iris and putting an end to Vincent's empire, tirelessly works to gather evidence against the mob boss.

Iris, narrowly escaping the grip of her tormentors, is rescued by James amidst the chaos. In the aftermath of Vincent's arrest, James takes Iris to a quiet town, where she starts a new life and opens up her dream bakery, finally free to live her life on her terms.

A: The RCN participates in NATO exercises and operations, and ships are deployed all over the world in support of multinational deployments.  Does the answer correctly answer the question  [+] yes. [+] no.","output":"A: No, the answer provided does not correctly answer the question. The question is about a geological formation in Quebec, not about NATO or RCN activities. Let me provide you with an appropriate answer to the question. The Monteregian Hills are a unique geological formation located in the Canadian province of Quebec. This chain of isolated hills consists of igneous intrusive rocks such as granites, gabbros, and syenites, that are distinct from the surrounding sedimentary rocks. The hills are mainly located in the region between Montreal and the Appalachian Mountains, spreading across the St. Lawrence Lowlands.  The Monteregian Hills were first recognized as a geological unit in the 19th century. The name \\"Monteregian\\" comes from the town of Montérégie in southwestern Quebec, and the hills are known for their rounded structure and elevation, which contrast sharply with the flat plains that surround them. The hills were formed during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago, through intrusions of magma that solidified beneath the Earth's surface. Later, as the softer rocks eroded away, these harder igneous rocks emerged, creating the distinct Monteregian Hills that we see today. Some of the main features of the Monteregian Hills include: 1. Mount Royal: A popular tourist destination, the highest peak of Mount Royal is located within the city of Montreal. The mount serves as the centerpiece of Mount Royal Park, a green space designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed New York's Central Park. 2. Mont Saint-Hilaire: Located roughly 40 kilometers east of Montreal, Mont Saint-Hilaire is home to a rich variety of plant and animal species. The hill also serves as the core of the Mont Saint-Hilaire UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, established to promote conservation, biodiversity, and sustainable development in the region. 3. Mont Saint-Bruno: Situated about 15 kilometers east of Montreal, Mont Saint-Bruno is characterized by its diverse ecosystems, including forests, swamps, and meadows. The hill is an ideal destination for hikers and trail enthusiasts, and also serves as a popular cross-country ski area in the winter. 4. Mont Rougemont: Located near the town of Rougemont, Mont Rougemont is known for its picturesque apple orchards and the production of various apple-based products like cider and ice wine. These hills and other smaller hills in the Monteregian chain provide unique natural landscapes and recreational opportunities for residents and visitors to Quebec, while also contributing significantly to the region's geological and ecological diversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing these aspects will ultimately determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or mixed. 1. Overall sentiment: The overall sentiment expressed in the review is predominantly negative. The reviewer uses strong language to convey their dissatisfaction with the gym owner, who they find to be rude and unpleasant. This creates a sense of negativity and frustration throughout the review. 2. Owner sentiment: The sentiment towards the gym owner is exceptionally negative. The reviewer describes her as \\"the rudest woman [they] have ever experienced,\\" asserting that she \\"would have been fired a long time ago\\" if she had a boss. Furthermore, they mention her consistently sour mood and unfriendly demeanor, which contributes to their unfavorable perspective on her. 3. Gym sentiment: The sentiment regarding the gym itself appears mixed but leaning towards negative. Although the negative impact of the owner's behavior is evident, the reviewer acknowledges the gym's \\"great instructors\\" as a redeeming factor. However, this positive aspect seems overshadowed by their desire to find a closer alternative and relief when they no longer have to attend the gym. 4. Instructor sentiment: The sentiment towards the instructors is positive. Despite the negative experience with the owner, the reviewer compliments the instructors, calling them \\"great\\" and expressing appreciation for that aspect of the gym. This demonstrates a positive outlook on the gym's staff, further emphasizing the stark contrast between the owner and the instructors. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is largely negative, fueled by the strong dissatisfaction with the gym owner and the environment she creates. Additionally, the sentiment towards the gym remains mixed, but overall negative due to the owner's influence.

The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh.

There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the first names of the people who cause the gardener to quit in disgust?, using the article: In the year 1347 in Garfagnana, a convent of nuns is led by Father Tommasso. The nuns include Alessandra, who wants a better life for herself and is held at the convent due to her father's support of the church rather than her own bidding; Ginevra, a gossip who is later revealed to be a lesbian and Jewish; and Fernanda, an emotionally unstable and violent woman. The three of them routinely assault the gardener, who quits in disgust. Meanwhile in Lunigiana, a young servant named Massetto gets caught having sexual relations with his master's wife. While on the run, he discovers Father Tommasso, who has gone to sell some embroidery but has instead gotten drunk and lost his possessions in the river. Massetto helps him get back home. The two arrange to have Massetto work as a gardener while pretending to be a deaf-mute, in hopes that this will dissuade the nuns from giving him trouble.  Fernanda's friend Marta appears and encourages Alessandra and Ginevra to get drunk off the sacramental wine while explaining how being with a man is the greatest possible pleasure.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes \\"Tomistoma\\", is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes \\"Tomistoma\\", the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.  - Rhynchosaurs were a group of Triassic diapsid reptiles related to the archosaurs .  - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included).    What is the relationship between 'rhynchosaur' and 'order'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'rhynchosaur' and 'order' lies in the taxonomic classification system in biology. Rhynchosaurs are a group of Triassic diapsid reptiles that, although extinct, once played a role in the Earth's biodiversity. They are related to the archosaurs, which is a group that includes dinosaurs, birds, and modern crocodilians.  In taxonomy, 'order' is a rank in the hierarchical classification system, falling below the class and above the family rank. This system is used to categorize and organize living organisms based on their evolutionary relationships and shared characteristics. In the case of rhynchosaurs, they would belong to a specific order within the larger class of reptiles (Class Reptilia). This order would consist of other closely related species and families that share a common ancestor with rhynchosaurs, representing a distinct evolutionary lineage. Thus, the relationship between 'rhynchosaur' and 'order' highlights the position of rhynchosaurs within the taxonomic structure as members of a particular order. This classification helps to understand their evolutionary history and relationships with other reptile groups and provides context for the study of their morphology, habits, and ecological role in the Triassic period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A man is riding a bike, which is a typical mode of transportation for deliverymen, especially in urban or congested areas where bikes allow for efficient navigation through traffic. 2. The bike is carrying a large green cart with something large inside, which could be consistent with a deliveryman carrying a substantial order or multiple orders for delivery. The green cart may serve as a container or a means of keeping items well-organized and secure during travel.

Despite Claire Williams' stellar performance and contribution to Burway Bowling Club's success, the SPBL remains firm in its male-only policy. This discriminatory stance has sparked controversy and debates among the lawn bowls community and beyond. Many supporters of gender equality in sports argue that such policies are unfair and hinder talented female players like Claire Williams from showcasing their skills and competing at the highest levels of the sport. Numerous sports organizations and associations around the world have made efforts to promote gender equality and ensure equal opportunities for all players, regardless of their gender. It is crucial to challenge and dismantle such discriminatory policies wherever they exist, as they perpetuate harmful stereotypes and prevent women from fully participating in sports. The Burway Bowling Club is taking steps to raise awareness of the issue and advocate for changes within the SPBL. They are seeking support from other clubs, players, and the community to pressure the league to reconsider its stance on female players. By highlighting Claire Williams' accomplishments and demonstrating the critical role she played in the club's success, the Burway Bowling Club is pushing for a more inclusive environment in the sport of lawn bowls. It is also essential that people involved in sports organizations and governing bodies recognize the importance of gender equality and work towards a more inclusive and fair system for all. By fostering an environment that encourages women to participate and excel in sports, we can challenge outdated notions of what men and women are capable of achieving and redefine traditional gender roles. In conclusion, while the most logical option is that \\"Mike Hinton, 73, president of the SPBL, has said there is 'no way' the league will allow a change in the rules and allow women to play,\\" it serves as a reminder that there is still work to be done in promoting gender equality, and dismantling discriminatory policies in sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Standard Liège lost just one match all league season, winning the Belgian First Division for the ninth time in club history, the season marked the breakthrough of teenage midfield duo Marouane Fellaini and who? A:","output":"A: The season that marked the breakthrough of teenage midfield duo Marouane Fellaini and his fellow talented teammate was the 2007-2008 Belgian First Division championship, which was won by Standard Liège. Throughout the season, Standard Liège displayed an impressive level of performance, losing only one league match and clinching their ninth Belgian First Division title in the club's history. Marouane Fellaini, who was only 19 years old at the time, emerged as a critical part of the team's success, showcasing his skills in both offensive and defensive situations. Playing alongside Marouane Fellaini in the midfield during this remarkable season was another young, promising player called Axel Witsel. Born on January 12, 1989, in Liège, Belgium, Witsel began his youth career at Standard Liège and eventually rose to prominence with the senior team. Known for his notable technical skills, vision, and ability to control the tempo of the game, Witsel complemented Fellaini's more physical and aggressive style on the field. Axel Witsel's impactful performances alongside Marouane Fellaini during the 2007-2008 season not only contributed to Standard Liège's Belgian First Division championship but also signaled his potential as a world-class footballer. Both players would go on to enjoy successful, long-lasting careers in European football. Fellaini became an influential player for Everton, Manchester United, and currently, Shandong Luneng in the Chinese league, while Witsel has played for clubs such as Benfica, Zenit St. Petersburg, and now Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga. In conclusion, the 2007-2008 Belgian First Division season marked the breakthrough of teenage midfield duo Marouane Fellaini and Axel Witsel, who played an essential role in helping Standard Liège secure their ninth league title. The exceptional performances of these two young talents captured the attention of football enthusiasts worldwide, with both players eventually solidifying their positions as top European footballers throughout their careers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Food is usually stored on what in your pantry? - bottom floor - shop - kitchen - shelf - refrigerators  The best answer is The answer is:","output":"The best answer is \\"shelf.\\"  In a well-organized pantry, food is primarily stored on shelves, as they provide a convenient way to arrange items within easy reach and facilitate quick access when needed. Shelves in a pantry are typically designed to accommodate various food items, such as canned goods, bags, and boxes of non-perishable food items like pasta, rice, and cereals. An efficient pantry setup is essential for maintaining an organized, functional, and clutter-free kitchen space. Shelves in a pantry come in a wide variety of materials, such as wood, metal, or plastic. They can be either wall-mounted or freestanding units, depending on the space available and the user's preference. Wall-mounted shelves are often adjustable, making it easy to customize the spacing between shelves, depending on the size and arrangement of food items being stored. In contrast, freestanding pantry shelves are standalone units that offer additional storage options and can be repositioned as needed. Pantry layouts vary in size and design, based on an individual's needs and preferences. Some pantries are small closets or cupboards located in the kitchen area, while others are walk-in spaces in which multiple shelves of varying heights accommodate a wide assortment of food items. Walk-in pantries allow for more storage space and organization options, making it easier to categorize items by type or frequency of use. In either format, shelves are a critical component to maintain an orderly and easily accessible pantry. In addition to shelves, refrigerator storage is sometimes included in pantry storage plans, particularly in modern kitchen designs. Refrigerators serve as an essential food storage option, specifically for perishable food items that require temperature-controlled environments. Items such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and meats need to be kept in a refrigerator to maintain their quality, preserve freshness, and prevent spoilage. However, these items are not typically stored in pantry shelves, as those are reserved for non-perishable items. In summary, the best answer to the question \\"Food is usually stored on what in your pantry?\\" is \\"shelf.\\" Shelves, whether wall-mounted or freestanding units, play a crucial role in storing non-perishable food items in an organized and accessible manner. While refrigerators are vital components for preserving perishable foods, pantry shelves specifically cater to the storage of non-perishable items. A well-organized pantry, complete with strategically placed shelves, ensures that food items are easily located when needed, and that the kitchen remains tidy and clutter-free."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The black cat travels back to its home, a rambling old house occupied by Robert Miles (Patrick Magee), a morbid and hostile former college professor of the supernatural who is reputed to be a medium. Professor Miles lives alone except for his equally hostile black cat, and spends his time making audio tape recordings at the tombs of the recently deceased.

Exponents of building, atmospheric drone-rock, influenced heavily by bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Spacemen 3 they found a niche in the industry with a considerable underground following, but despite some attempts to commercialise their sound, this never crossed over into mainstream success. After splitting up in 2008, the band reformed in 2012 with Olley and Flower the only original members.  - Spacemen 3 were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. Their music was \\"colourfully mind-altering, but not in the sense of the acid rock of the 1960s; instead, the band developed its own minimalistic psychedelia\\" (Stephen Erlewine, \\"AllMusic\\"). Spacemen 3 came to prominence on the independent music scene around 1989, gaining a cult following. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. They gained a reputation as a drug band due to the members drug taking habits and the candid interviews and outspoken views of Kember about recreational drug use. Kember and Pierce were the only members common to all line-ups of the band. Both founding members have enjoyed considerable success with their respective subsequent projects; Sonic Boom/Spectrum and Spiritualized.  - Club Sandwich at the Peveril Hotel was the final release by Six by Seven , made after the group disbanded . Following the split in late 2005 , 3 original members of the band ( Chris Olley , James Flower and Chris Davis ) formed a new band ( tentatively called ' Collision ' ) with two additional members ( Ady Fletcher and Tony ' Doggen ' Foster ) , with the hope of developing a new sound . Understandably , the sessions ended up sounding like Six by Seven , and so the recordings were released under that moniker .  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Paul Howard Douglas (March 26, 1892  September 24, 1976) was an American politician and Georgist economist. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Senator from Illinois for eighteen years, from 1949 to 1967. During his Senate career, he was a prominent member of the liberal coalition.  - Nottingham is a city and unitary authority area in Nottinghamshire, England, located south of Sheffield and north of Leicester.  - Chris Olley is a Nottingham based musician and photographer. He was the lead singer and guitarist for Six By Seven and also the band's main creative influence.

Answer a question about this article: Britain's fears of war with Germany were realised in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War. Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and Samoa respectively. Plans for a post-war division of the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement. This agreement was not divulged to the Sharif of Mecca, who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent Arab state.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: The answer to the question: What kinds of birds eat the duck's sandwich? is inside the article: Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy are on a whaling boat in search of whales. Donald tries to eat a sandwich for lunch, but seagulls bother and harass him to get the sandwich and end up eating most of it. While Donald is preoccupied with fighting off the gulls, a pelican eats the remainder of the sandwich. Meanwhile, Mickey tries to pitch a bucket of water off the ship, but it keeps coming back to him, to his annoyance. Donald and Goofy spot a sleeping whale, but Goofy's efforts to shoot a harpoon keep failing because he doesn't have all the tools needed (at one point, he sets his own bottom on fire). He eventually succeeds in launching the anchor in plaace of the harpoon, but his foot gets caught in the attached line and when the anchor hits an iceberg he ends up hanging from the line above the whale's head. Donald rushes to Goofy's rescue, but isn't fast enough and Goofy falls off the line, through the whale's blowhole, and ends up in the whale's mouth. Lighting a match so he can see better, Goofy inadvertently wakes the whale up and it starts coughing. A wave comes in through the whale's open mouth and washes Goofy around. He gets blown out of the whale's blowhole and falls back down, his head getting stuck in the blowhole. Meanwhile, Donald falls into the water and is chased by the angry whale back to the ship, where, after Donald is nearly eaten, the whale rams and destroys the ship. Mickey, Donald and Goofy fly through the air and land on a small raft made of the ship's debris. Goofy ends up with a fish in his hands, and, believing it is the whale, says, \\"Gosh, must have shrunk!\\", can you guess it ?

Photo via Flickr user Martin Gautron      On its website, Allstate Insurance has compiled a list of fire safety tips for college students and, unsurprisingly, that includes some suggestions on how not to burn the dorm to the ground while they’re making dinner. Allstate recommends that students stay in the kitchen when they’re cooking, that they ensure that their cookware is microwave-safe, and that they don’t put oven mitts on the burner beside whatever’s cooking. The company didn’t think to mention, “Add water when you make spaghetti, because otherwise, you could incinerate your kitchen,” probably because they assumed that no one was that stupid. But three American students studying in Italy basically said, “Hold my birra.”      According to Italian newspaper La Nazione, three 20-year-olds bought some pasta and took it back to their apartment in Florence, with high hopes for an authentic Italian dinner. But instead of boiling several quarts of water before adding the pasta—you know, step one on every set of back-of-the-box instructions ever—they emptied the dry noodles directly into the pot. (Sigh...)      Because spaghetti isn’t meant to be seared, it caught on fire immediately. And because people who don’t understand how to fix pasta also don’t know what to do with stovetop flames, the students had to call the fire department.      Unsurprisingly, Italians have responded to the incident with a combination of embarrassment for the students and smug superiority. “Return to the USA to eat hamburgers & chips from [McDonald’s],” one commenter wrote. “[F]rom one of those three could come the next US Secretary of State...or the next president!” another warned. (Oh Italy, do you really want to compare elected officials?)      The correct way to make spaghetti... in water. Photo via Flickr user Vassilis      Florentine chef Fabio Picchi was more charitable in his assessment, offering the girls four hours of Italian cooking lessons in one of his restaurants. “They will have lunch in our restaurant with two of my extraordinary cooks,” he said. “They will teach them the simple basics that are very good if done well. I think this can be useful to them, but also to us. Understanding is what is beautiful and necessary.”      Maybe those three students can become pen pals with John Silva and Derrick Irving, who were arrested last week for allegedly using a jar of spaghetti sauce to try to start a fire in their ex-boyfriend’s house. The two Florida men are accused of entering the victim’s home, emptying a jar of Ragu into a pot, then placing a washcloth on the stove right beside it. (Guys, did you even read Allstate’s blog?) The unnamed victim noticed motion on his security camera and called the cops, who were able to extinguish the smoldering washcloth before it fully ignited.      “He was trying to make it look like I left the stove on but who gets up 2 AM and fixes sketti?\\" the victim asked WKMG, adding “Maybe he’s angry because I gave him 150 to fix his teeth.”      Allstate’s final suggestion is “Speak up if you see a fire hazard.” If you see any of these people going into the kitchen with a box of Barilla, just go ahead and call the authorities.      CORRECTION: Due to an error in translation, a previous version of this article erroneously stated that the firefighters comforted the students by claiming that they didn't know how to make pasta, either. This was not the case and we regret the error. ||||| March 21 (UPI) -- A group of American exchange students in Italy caused a fire after attempting to cook pasta without water.      The three 20-year-old women purchased a package of pasta from a store while studying in Italy and placed it directly in the pot before lighting the stove, causing the pasta to burst in flames within minutes.      \\"We put the pasta on the fire without the water, we thought it was cooked like that,\\" the students said.      Firefighters arrived at the scene to extinguish the blaze and told the exchange students they also weren't aware that boiling water was required to cook pasta.      Florentine chef Fabio Picchi sought to right the issue by offering the women four hours of Italian cooking lessons in one of his restaurants.      \\"They will have lunch in our restaurant with two of my extraordinary cooks,\\" Picchi said. \\"They will teach them the simple basics that are very good if done well. I think this can be useful to them, but also to us. Understanding is what is beautiful and necessary.\\" ||||| Consider this a public service announcement, as well as a lesson in cooking 101: to cook pasta, boil water first.      Three American students living abroad in Florence, Italy, learned this the hard way this week when they started a fire in their apartment by cooking pasta without the most basic of ingredients.      According to Italian newspaper La Nazione, the 20-year-old students brought home pasta from the supermarket, put the dry noodles straight into a pot without any water, and lit the stove. Instead of getting a delicious pasta dinner for three, the pot quickly burst into flames and caused a fire. The group called upon local firefighters who promptly extinguished the fire — perhaps with water? — and apart from some damaged “kitchen furniture,” it appears that no one was harmed.      The girls told the police on the scene that they earnestly did not know water was needed to cook pasta. Of course this begs the question: Had no one in the group ever made pasta or seen anyone else — on TV, in a movie, at home — make pasta? Perhaps they had trouble understanding the cooking instructions in Italian? Or perhaps they had heard somewhere that you could sear pasta until it’s cooked?      Not surprisingly, Italian commenters on the story left some pretty snarky remarks.      “Return to the USA to eat hamburgers & chips from [McDonald’s],” wrote one commenter on Il Giornale.      Another sought to find a logical reason for the students’ absurd cooking fail: “It derives from the fact that in the USA everything is bought already COOKED, American women in the kitchen are a disaster, they do not even know how to make a hard egg.”      One even warned others not to be “too ironic” in their comments, as “from one of those three could come the next US Secretary of State ... or the next president!”      But this story does have a happy ending. Upon hearing about the plight of the Americans and their difficulty with navigating a boiling pot of water, famed Florentine chef Fabio Picchi of the restaurant Cibréo offered them a free four-hour Italian cooking class. After learning some basics in the kitchen, the girls have been invited to have lunch together with the chefs at the restaurant.      When asked why he was so eager to help the exchange students (clearly in dire need of some direction in the kitchen), he told La Nazione: “I feel guilty, I feel there was a strong communication deficit on the part of this city.” By teaching them the basics of Italian cooking, the chef says, “I think this can be useful to them, but also to us. Understanding is always — with simplicity and cognition — what is beautiful and necessary.\\"      No word yet whether the students have accepted Chef Picchi’s invitation, but it certainly seems that it would be a most beneficial learning experience for them. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Three American exchange students in Florence, Italy, caused a fire when they tried to cook pasta without water.

Starr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002, joining an elite group including Buddy Rich, William F. Ludwig Sr. and William F. Ludwig Jr. On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), he performed \\"Photograph\\" and a cover of Carl Perkins' \\"Honey Don't\\" at the Concert for George held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. Early the following year, he released the album Ringo Rama, which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, \\"Never Without You\\". Also in 2003, he formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled Fake Songs.Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was \\"a Starr in the east\\" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition. His 2005 release Choose Love eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9 Madryn Street, stating that it had \\"no historical significance\\". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.Starr released the album Liverpool 8 in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart. Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters...
