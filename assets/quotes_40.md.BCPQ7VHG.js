I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do.

Q:When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night. Bruce Kugler Question: what is probably true about Bruce? Options: - not enough information   - he is sensitive   - he is thick skinned   - he will find a new profession === The correct answer is A:","output":"It is likely true that Bruce is sensitive.  The situation described by Bruce showcases a traumatic and painful experience he underwent early in his career in the psychiatric unit of a private hospital. His recollection of the incident and the vividness of the details provided indicate that he was deeply affected by what happened. He specifically mentions feeling helpless and being plagued by the young man's face when trying to sleep at night. All of these factors point towards Bruce being sensitive to the suffering of others and the emotional toll it can take on him. Being sensitive, in this context, means that Bruce is highly attuned to the emotions and distress of those around him, particularly his patients. He could be empathetic and compassionate, which could be great qualities to have as a therapist. However, it may also mean that he bears the emotional weight of his patients' experiences, which can be mentally and emotionally draining. While there might not be enough information to accurately conclude whether Bruce would find a new profession or not, it is evident that such traumatic experiences can significantly impact mental health professionals. It can lead some individuals to reconsider their career choices or seek additional guidance and support to continue in their line of work. Moreover, Bruce's personal account of his experience doesn't provide enough information to infer that he is thick-skinned. In contrast, his emotional response and the described lasting effects of the incident suggest that he is more sensitive to the challenges and traumas faced in his profession. In conclusion, based on the given information, it is most probable that Bruce is sensitive, which may have both positive and negative implications for his work as a therapist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Celebration of love: A wedding is fundamentally a celebration of the love and commitment between two individuals. Love is a powerful emotion that brings happiness and joy to both the couple and the attendees of the wedding. The idea of two people promising to share their lives together and support each other is an affirming and uplifting concept that encompasses the essence of human relationships. 2. Social bonds: One of the key components of a wedding is the presence of friends, family, and other loved ones. People come together to witness the union and share their happiness and best wishes with the couple. Socializing, sharing stories, dancing, and mingling with others leads to a heightened sense of joy, making the atmosphere at weddings positive and enjoyable. 3. Cultural and religious significance: Weddings hold unique cultural and religious significance, with various customs and rituals being observed across different cultures and faiths. These practices often serve to remind the couple of their responsibilities and the importance of the commitment they are making, while also creating a shared experience for attendees that fosters a sense of connection and happiness. 4. Music, dancing, and entertainment: Music and dancing are integral parts of most wedding celebrations. These activities contribute to the joyous atmosphere by encouraging attendees to let loose, have fun, and enjoy themselves. Furthermore, the couple often hires entertainers or organizes special performances that add to the overall excitement and amusement of the event. 5. Emotional moments: Beyond all the revelry, weddings are also packed with emotional and heartfelt moments. Exchanging vows, hearing speeches from loved ones, and witnessing the couple's love story unfold can evoke strong feelings of sentimentality and happiness among attendees. 6. Shared memories: As a milestone event, weddings create lasting memories. Guests often walk away from the celebration with stories, pictures, and tokens that will become cherished mementos in years to come.

Sir Alec Guinness claims he saw a ghost while in Bangalore filming David Lean's A Passage To India. Wrote to his wife: 'A very conventional white ghost appeared, an elderly... woman in grey white and heavily veiled' Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Oscar-Winner Sir Alec Guinness's Otherworldly Encounter: Letters Reveal He Saw a Ghost in India Subtitle: Newly published collection of letters chronicles the late actor's ghostly experience while shooting David Lean's \\"A Passage To India.\\" In a series of never-before-seen personal letters, recently published for the first time, legendary actor Sir Alec Guinness recalls an extraordinary encounter with the supernatural. The letters reveal that while filming David Lean's adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel, \\"A Passage To India,\\" in Bangalore, India, the Oscar-winner claims to have seen a ghost. In this newly discovered correspondence, Guinness wrote to his wife, describing his experience with the apparition. \\"A very conventional white ghost appeared,\\" he wrote. \\"An elderly... woman in grey white and heavily veiled.\\" His matter-of-fact tone seems to convey an eerie sense of calm in the face of such an extraordinary event, revealing the steadfast character of the esteemed actor. Alec Guinness, who passed away in 2000, was one of the most respected and versatile actors of his generation, starring in critically acclaimed and successful films such as \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets,\\" \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai,\\" \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" \\"Doctor Zhivago,\\" and eventually becoming known to a whole new generation of fans through his iconic portrayal of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy. The filming of \\"A Passage to India,\\" which brought him to the Indian subcontinent in the first place, would later help him secure an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Directed by David Lean, the film was lauded not only for its stellar cast and production values, but also for its ability to capture the complexities of British-Indian relationships in the early 20th century. Guinness's role as Professor Godbole added to the mystique and philosophical undertones of the movie. Yet, it seems that on one quiet evening in Bangalore, as Guinness sat in his room, he had an experience that few other cast or crew members have shared. His casual mention of this ghostly apparition speaks volumes about the man's courage and perhaps even his belief in the transcendental. In a way, this newly revealed encounter with the supernatural only adds another curious layer to the mystique surrounding Sir Alec Guinness. As an actor who truly immersed himself in his roles, one can only wonder how this brush with the otherworldly may have translated into his subsequent performances. The publication of these letters offers an intimate glimpse into the life of a celebrated actor. As we learn more about Guinness's fascinating personal life, including his encounters with the metaphysical, it gives us a newfound appreciation for the depth and range of his talents. Allowing us to remember Sir Alec Guinness not only as a versatile and legendary actor but also as a man who experienced, as his characters often did, that which lies beyond the mundane in this world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose the ice cubes will be prepared happens, how will it affect there are less fires.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If ice cubes are prepared and effectively used to extinguish or minimize forest fires, it will potentially result in less fires and a reduced impact on the natural habitats of animals. This would mean that the fire surrounding the vicinity would not be as severe, and fewer animals would be trapped or affected. As a result, there would be a reduced number of displaced animals searching for a new habitat, as their original habitat would not be as severely destroyed. This, in turn, would lead to less conflict between the surviving animals and other animals in nearby habitats, as there would be no overcrowding due to fewer animals migrating to new locations.

Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and audience participation. Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream. The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art. The term \\"cult film\\" itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies, though \\"cult\\" was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that.  - Criminal law is the body of law that relates to crime. It regulates social conduct and proscribes whatever is threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people.

Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - Gina L.

Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - Al Israel (April 16, 1935  March 16, 2011) was an American film and TV actor who is best known for his role as the Colombian drug dealer \\"Hector the Toad\\" in the 1983 cult film \\"Scarface\\".

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\".

The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur.  and the situation: The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation.  Answer the following question: Which county experienced less runoff? Answer:","output":"Saulk county experienced less runoff compared to Dirk county. In Dirk county, the steady rain led to massive water infiltration and many flood events, indicating a higher level of runoff as the ground reached its saturation point and could not absorb more water. Meanwhile, in Saulk county, the thunderstorms caused runoff but with less infiltration and soil saturation, suggesting the runoff was less extensive compared to Dirk county."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They occur when the immune system responds to a foreign substance, known as an allergen, causing symptoms such as sneezing, itching, and watery eyes. While some allergies are mild and easier to manage, others can be life-threatening. The following article provides a comprehensive guide to living comfortably with allergies. By adhering to these tips, individuals with allergies can maintain a good quality of life and prevent severe allergic reactions. 1. Avoid your triggers The first and foremost step to manage allergies is to identify and avoid the allergens that trigger your symptoms. Common triggers include pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and certain foods. This can be achieved by maintaining a diary to record your symptoms and their corresponding causes. Regularly review this diary to determine any patterns and discuss them with your healthcare provider. 2. Use caution when preparing food For those with food allergies, being mindful when preparing meals is crucial. Read food labels carefully and avoid cross-contamination by using separate utensils and cutting boards for different ingredients. Additionally, inform restaurant staff about your allergies when dining out and remind them to ensure your meal is prepared separately from allergenic ingredients. 3. Cut down on dust in your home Reducing dust accumulation is essential for managing allergies triggered by dust mites. Regularly clean your living space and vacuum carpets, as well as use allergen-proof covers for your pillows and mattress. Investing in an air purifier with a HEPA filter can also help to reduce airborne allergens in your home. 4. Control the movements of family pets Pet dander is another common allergen. Limit the areas where pets can roam within your home and avoid letting them sleep in your bedroom. Regularly bathe pets to reduce dander and consider using a HEPA air purifier to minimize airborne irritants. 5. Avoid insect bites when spending time outside For those with insect sting allergies, it's essential to protect yourself from bites and stings. Wear protective clothing outdoors, avoid using scented products that may attract insects, and keep food covered during picnics or outdoor events. Consult your doctor for appropriate treatment options if you're prone to severe reactions. 6. Inform all medical staff if you have a drug allergy A drug allergy can have serious consequences if not managed properly. Inform your healthcare providers about any known drug allergies to ensure they prescribe you safe and appropriate medications. 7. Keep your EpiPen with you EpiPens, or epinephrine auto-injectors, are lifesaving devices for people with severe allergies. Carry one with you at all times and familiarize yourself with its proper use. Make sure friends and family members are aware of your condition and know how to administer the EpiPen in case of an emergency. 8. Take your medication as directed Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to help manage your allergy symptoms, such as antihistamines or corticosteroids. It is essential to take these medications as directed to control your symptoms effectively and reduce the risk of severe reactions. 9. Get allergy shots Immunotherapy, or allergy shots, can be beneficial for individuals suffering from severe allergies that aren't adequately managed with medications alone. Speak with your healthcare provider about whether this treatment option is suitable for you. Conclusion Living with allergies can be challenging, but by implementing these essential tips and working closely with your healthcare provider, you can minimize your symptoms and enjoy a better quality of life. Remember that each individual's allergies are different, and it is vital to consult with your doctor to plan the best strategy to manage your specific needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent.

Then he took a piece of iron the shape of the horse horse's foot , and clapped *it* on, and drove some nails through the shoe quite into its hoof, so that the shoe was firmly on Are \\"it\\" and \\"piece of iron\\" the same thing in the aforementioned sentence?","output":"Yes, in the sentence provided, the pronoun \\"it\\" is referring back to the \\"piece of iron.\\" The iron is shaped into a form that mimics the horse's foot. After molding the iron, he proceeds to attach \\"it\\"-- the iron that now looks like a horseshoe-- to the horse's hoof. The necessity of the horseshoe comes from the need to protect the horse's hoof from any potential damage that may occur during its movement or work.  The sentence employs this pronoun \\"it\\" to refer back to the piece of iron in order to avoid repetition and maintain sentence fluency. This is a common practice in English language in order to ensure that the sentences flow and maintain their clarity without being redundant or excessively verbose. This noun-pronoun relationship is an integral part of English grammar. In this case, it allows the audience to understand that the piece of iron has undergone a transformation-- it's been shaped to fit the horse's hoof-- and is being affixed as a horseshoe. When applied to the horse's foot, the familiar shape of the piece of iron becomes functional, acting as a protective barrier or pad for the softer, more sensitive structures of the hoof. The nails are driven through the shoe and into the hoof, not injuring the horse, but securing the shoe firmly in place. The horse's hoof has a thick insensitive part, like our nails, that doesn't cause any discomfort to the horse when the shoe is attached. So, the process described is essentially the common practice of shoeing a horse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a business proposition made by billionaire financier Carl Icahn to acquire Mylan Laboratories Inc., a leading US-based company that manufactures and distributes generic medicines. The offer, made for approximately 5.38 billion, is intended to prevent Mylan Laboratories from purchasing King Pharmaceuticals Inc., another pharmaceutical company. Carl Icahn's interest in acquiring Mylan Laboratories seems to be fueled by his apparent disagreement with Mylan's decision to purchase King Pharmaceuticals. As a major Mylan shareholder, Icahn may believe that the acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals would not be in the best interest of Mylan Laboratories or its investors. His intention to buy Mylan is therefore likely to be seen as a strategic move aimed at disrupting the proposed merger between the two pharmaceutical companies and possibly protecting Mylan's current position and value within the market. This text illustrates the complexity and dynamics of the business world, where major transactions and acquisitions can impact the direction and growth of companies in various industries. In this case, the pharmaceutical industry is at the center of attention, with one of its leading players, Mylan Laboratories, being subject to a potential change in ownership. The involvement of the influential figure, Carl Icahn, emphasizes the significance of the proposed acquisition and its potential implications for the industry. Overall, the text is about a high-stakes business maneuver that could alter the landscape of the pharmaceutical sector and potentially impact various stakeholders, including investors, employees, and consumers who rely on the products and services provided by the companies involved in this deal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Jonathan Elystan Rees said a lack of resources and lawyers in court as a result of less funding was making it difficult for staff to do their jobs. His criticism comes after the CPS was blamed for the collapse of a number of high-profile criminal cases in Wales. The government rejected claims budget cuts have affected the CPS' performance. The CPS said it had tried to protect prosecution lawyers from the reductions; its budget has been cut by 25% since 2010 and staff numbers have fallen by 2,400. Figures analysed by BBC Wales show the proportion of cases in Wales that did not make it to a full trial because of reasons relating to the CPS has gradually increased. In 2009, CPS faults accounted for about 16.5% of case failures in Wales, compared to 19.6% in 2014. Mr Rees, a representative of the Criminal Bar Association in Wales, said CPS staff were \\"operating with one hand tied behind their back at the moment\\" and often found themselves covering several courts at the same time. \\"If you have properly funded prosecution and properly funded defence scrutinising each other's positions and challenging the case of either side, you're going to get the right result - that's British justice, that's how it works,\\" he said. \\"When one side or, even worse, both sides, aren't firing on all cylinders because they're not properly funded, that's when you get room for errors to take place and corners to be cut, not deliberately but inadvertently, and that's when there's a risk of miscarriages of justice.\\" Siobhan Blake, deputy chief crown prosecutor for Wales, denied cases were not being properly scrutinised, adding it had a conviction rate of about 80% - an increase on previous years. \\"I'm very confident that we have highly-skilled, professional people who are extremely dedicated to the work that they do,\\" she said. The Treasury said the CPS budget settlement \\"protected core services\\", ensuring it had the resources needed to continue to tackle crime \\"effectively and efficiently\\". It added the UK legal aid system remained \\"one of the most generous in the world\\" with Â£1.6bn spent last year. Charges against two nurses due to stand trial for the neglect of patients at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend were dismissed last year after the court heard a computer log of patient records was unreliable. The judge described the prosecution's reliance on the log as \\"unrealistic\\" and \\"faintly desperate\\". In October 2015, misconduct charges against three council bosses were dropped just weeks before they were due to stand trial. The case collapse followed judges' criticism of prosecution lawyers for being unprepared at earlier hearings. A recent report from the CPS Inspectorate warned victims were being \\"let down\\" by poor communication from prosecution officials. Inspectors said the CPS was slow to contact victims in almost half of cases it examined and did not always take their views into account on key decisions. South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael has called for a new independent body to investigate complaints against the CPS. But a spokesman for the Attorney General's office said complaints about CPS performance could be referred to the Independent Assessor of Complaints. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Jonathan Elystan Rees, a representative of the Criminal Bar Association in Wales, has claimed that budget cuts to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are resulting in increased errors and a heightened risk of miscarriages of justice.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Traditional gender roles exist because a long time ago, people thought boys and girls should do different things. Just like we match colors to things like \\"pink is for girls\\" and \\"blue is for boys\\", people matched different jobs for girls and boys. This happened mostly because of the way boys and girls are built differently - boys are usually bigger and stronger, while girls can have babies. So, people thought that boys should do jobs that needed big muscles, like hunting or building things, and girls should stay home, take care of babies and do housework. Gender roles were determined this way by looking at what people thought boys and girls were good at. It's like choosing a toy truck for a boy and a doll for a girl, just because we think boys like trucks and girls like dolls. But really, any child can play with and enjoy any toy they want!

Being punctual and well-prepared for a date demonstrates that a person values the time and feelings of their date. It shows that they have taken the time and effort to make this event special and that they care about making a strong impression. Arriving on time also helps to create a comfortable environment for the date, as being late often causes stress and anxiety for both parties. In answer A: put on her clothes, it can be considered as part of the process of getting ready but doesn't necessarily answer the question as well as answer C. Everyone puts on clothes to go out, it's a basic necessity, and does not directly address the reason behind Taylor's actions to be on time specifically. In answer B: did this to show frustration, it doesn't align with the context provided. The context does not mention any frustration or anger, so it is not a suitable answer to the question. In fact, being punctual and prepared for a date typically indicates the opposite of frustration, implying care and consideration for the other person's time and feelings. In summary, the best answer to the question \\"Why did Taylor do this?\\" according to the context provided is C: did this to be polite. This answer emphasizes the respect and consideration Taylor showed towards their date by being punctual and well-prepared."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They form from haploid spores. They have male and/or female reproductive organs and reproduce sexually. They produce haploid gametes by mitosis. Fertilization of gametes produces diploid zygotes. Zygotes develop into the diploid generation.   Q: How do gametophyte plants form haploid gametes?   A: Pick your answer from:  1). during omniosis.  2). during after mitosis.  3). during after omniosis.  4). through mitosis. Answer:","output":"Gametophyte plants form haploid gametes through mitosis. This is option 4 in the given choices. To provide more context and understanding, let's delve deeper into the process. Gametophytes are the haploid generation of plants in their life cycle, and they produce gametes, which are necessary for sexual reproduction. These haploid gametes come from the haploid cells of the gametophyte plant. Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells, both having the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. In the case of gametophyte plants, since they are already haploid, mitosis allows them to produce haploid gametes with the same number of chromosomes as the parent gametophyte. This is different from meiosis, which occurs in the diploid generation where the cell divisions result in the production of haploid cells with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. During the process of mitosis in gametophyte plants, the haploid cells go through the stages of prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, eventually resulting in the formation of two identical cells with the same number of chromosomes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they can be involved in the process of fertilization. When a female gamete (egg) and a male gamete (sperm) fuse, they form a diploid zygote, which then develops into the diploid generation of the plant life cycle. This alternation between the haploid and diploid generations is a crucial aspect of the life cycle of plants and ensures genetic diversity among offspring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: Higher pressures increase the solubility of gases. You are probably familiar with this concept as it relates to carbonated beverages. Before opening the container, the inside is pressurized, so a large amount of CO 2 is dissolved in the liquid. After opening, the pressure decreases (to the ambient pressure), so the solubility of CO 2 drops, causing it to bubble out of solution. Because they are not compressible like gases, solid and liquid solutes do not have noticeable changes in solubility at different external pressures.  I am facing a new situation today: Robin is an exterminator who is making new mixtures of chemicals to use for when he gets called to kill rats in his neighborhood. To make the mixtures, he has to dissolve nitrogen gas in containers of water. In one container, container A, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under high pressure. In the other container, container B, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under low pressure.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which container will have lower solubility of the nitrogen gas?","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, the solubility of gases is directly related to the pressure applied on the gas. This principle is known as Henry's Law, which states that the concentration of a dissolved gas in a liquid (solubility) is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas in equilibrium with the liquid. In your new situation with Robin, the exterminator, he is dissolving nitrogen gas in two containers of water: container A with high pressure, and container B with low pressure. According to Henry's Law and the information from the article, the solubility of the nitrogen gas will be higher in a container with higher pressure and lower in a container with lower pressure. Therefore, the correct answer to your question is that container B will have a lower solubility of the nitrogen gas compared to container A, due to the lower pressure applied in container B. This means that a smaller amount of nitrogen gas will dissolve in the water of container B than in container A, where the high pressure causes a greater amount of nitrogen gas to dissolve in the water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only \\"curiosities\\"? ?  On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820.  Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \\"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\\"Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings \\"please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind.\\"Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of Georg Friedrich Kersting, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl (1788–1857).

Write an article with the title: \\"In 2010 NCAA tournament loss to Ohio, Georgetown struggles to determine why it went wrong\\" Article:","output":"Title: In 2010 NCAA Tournament Loss to Ohio, Georgetown Struggles to Determine Why It Went Wrong Introduction: The 2010 NCAA Tournament started with hope and high expectations for the Georgetown Hoyas as they secured the third seed and a chance to prove their mettle on college basketball's biggest stage. However, those dreams quickly vanished as they fell victim to a shocking upset loss at the hands of the 14th-seeded Ohio University Bobcats. With the dust finally settled, Georgetown's failure to advance remains one of the biggest surprises in the tournament's history. As the team analyzes the factors behind the defeat, it becomes imperative to consider key elements contributing to the Hoya's unceremonious exit from the competition. Georgetown's Offensive Struggles: From the opening tip-off, Georgetown's offense seemed off the mark. The usually-reliable scoring machine struggled to make shots against a determined Ohio defense that had its sights set on a monumental upset. The Hoyas shot just 38.2% from the field, a far cry from their regular-season average of 49.0%. Seeking a spark, Georgetown’s coaching staff may have concentrated too much on offensive plays, causing the team to lose focus and ultimately fail to shift the momentum in their favor. By neglecting the other crucial aspects of the game, the Hoyas upset their own balance and fostered a disjointed performance that left the door open for Ohio to strike. Ohio University's Superb Performance: While attention naturally gravitates toward Georgetown's underwhelming display, it is essential to recognize Ohio University's exceptional effort in pulling off the upset. Led by their star player Armon Bassett, the Bobcats were fearless and took full advantage of the Hoyas' lackluster performance. Bassett contributed 32 points, scoring more than any other individual that night. The Bobcats were also highly efficient from beyond the arc, connecting on 13 of 23 three-point attempts. This offensive showcase, combined with solid defensive play, made it extremely difficult for the Hoyas to regain control of the game. In addition, Ohio's fast-paced tempo seemed to wear down and frustrate Georgetown, further contributing to their demise. Defensive Lapses: Georgetown's usually formidable defense also appeared to falter in this critical matchup. Accustomed to contesting shots and stifling opponents, the Hoyas allowed the Bobcats to shoot 58.2% from the field, with Ohio's dynamic backcourt duo of Bassett and D.J. Cooper taking full advantage. Georgetown’s defenders seemed unable to adapt to Ohio's relentless offensive pressure, leaving them unable to force turnovers and transition effectively. Many have attributed the defensive breakdown to a lack of focus, communication, and determination within the team, resulting in an inability to properly execute the game plan. Mental Preparation and Complacency: As a higher-seeded team facing a seemingly lesser opponent, Georgetown may have entered the matchup with an air of complacency, underestimating the resolve of the Ohio University Bobcats. This lack of urgency undoubtedly affected the overall focus, teamwork, and mindset of the Hoyas, who appeared put off by the ferocity and tenacity of their opponents. The mental and emotional aspects of the game should not be discounted, as they often play a significant role in separating winners from losers, particularly in high-stakes single-elimination tournaments such as the NCAA. Conclusion: Georgetown's disappointing exit at the hands of Ohio University in the 2010 NCAA Tournament serves as a poignant reminder that no team can ever be taken for granted, regardless of rankings or reputations. Despite the setback, the Hoyas have an opportunity to learn from this experience, emphasizing the importance of consistent focus, preparation, and execution. By addressing these critical factors, Georgetown can strengthen its program to avoid similar pitfalls in the future. On the other hand, Ohio's victory will forever be remembered as a shining example of the unpredictability and excitement that makes the NCAA Tournament one of the most captivating spectacles in sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, a recent Eater article entitled \\"Three Charts That Show Why Culinary School Is Not Worth It\\" documents exactly that, showing how culinary school costs are on par with tuition at pricey four-year private colleges, as well as how getting a culinary arts degree doesn't really lead to a much higher salary than if a chef started out in a restaurant after high school. Eateries are getting creative in efforts to attract up-and-coming chefs by paying part of their workers' student loans every month, offering stock ownership, and paying more, per Fortune. (Restaurant reservations are also falling by the wayside.) Expand this summary.","output":"The restaurant industry is facing a shortage of chefs as the economy revitalizes and more eateries continue opening. Restaurateurs report difficulty in finding enough qualified kitchen staff to meet the demand. A few years ago, a single job opening could attract numerous applications allowing restaurant owners to select the best candidate easily. However, the situation has reversed, with one cook now being sought after by several restaurants. There are multiple factors contributing to this shortage. The increase in the number of restaurants opening up due to the economic recovery is one reason. Another reason is the rise of \\"entitled millennials\\", with young chefs eager to open their own establishments rather than working in an existing kitchen. The popularity of television cooking shows has also influenced this mindset, creating a perception that owning a restaurant or being a celebrity chef is more glamorous and easier to achieve than in reality. Culinary school graduates often leave their education with significant debt and face low starting salaries in the restaurant industry. This leads many culinary professionals to turn towards resorts, chains, and other establishments that can offer higher salaries and better employee benefits. A recent article by Eater highlights that culinary school costs are similar to tuition fees at expensive four-year private colleges. Additionally, obtaining a culinary arts degree doesn't necessarily lead to a significantly higher salary compared to starting in a restaurant directly after high school. To attract and retain talented chefs, restaurants are implementing creative strategies. Some are offering to pay part of their employees' student loan debts every month, while others offer stock ownership or higher salaries. It's crucial for the restaurant industry to address this issue, as talented chefs are essential for maintaining the high quality and innovation that customers expect from their dining experiences. Lastly, the decline in restaurant reservations is also posing challenges for eateries, emphasizing the need for adaptable business models and a strong, reliable workforce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Information:  - Advocacy is an activity by an individual or group which aims to influence decisions within political, economic, and social systems and institutions. Advocacy can include many activities that a person or organization undertakes including media campaigns, public speaking, commissioning and publishing research or conducting exit poll or the filing of an amicus brief. Lobbying (often by lobby groups) is a form of advocacy where a direct approach is made to legislators on an issue which plays a significant role in modern politics. Research has started to address how advocacy groups in the United States and Canada are using social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action.  - A barrister (also known as barrister-at-law or bar-at-law) is a type of lawyer in common law jurisdictions who works at higher levels of court. Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom advocacy and litigation. Their tasks include taking cases in superior courts and tribunals, drafting legal pleadings, researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions. Often, barristers are also recognised as \\"legal scholars\\".  - A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.  - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.  - Richard Pepper Arden , 1st Baron Alvanley PC KC ( 20 May 1744 -- 19 March 1804 ) was a British barrister and Whig politician , who served as the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas . He was a Member of Parliament from 1783 to 1801 .  - Common law (also known as case law or precedent) is law developed by judges, courts, and similar tribunals, stated in decisions that nominally decide individual cases but that in addition have precedential effect on future cases. Common law is a third branch of law, in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as \\"stare decisis\\"). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \\"matter of first impression\\"), judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision). Resolution of the issue in one case becomes precedent that binds future courts. \\"Stare decisis\\", the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.  - A tribunal, generally, is any person or institution with authority to judge, adjudicate on, or determine claims or disputeswhether or not it is called a tribunal in its title. For example, an advocate who appears before a court with a single judge could describe that judge as 'their tribunal'. Many governmental bodies that are titled 'tribunals' are so described to emphasize that they are not courts of normal jurisdiction. For example, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is a body specially constituted under international law; in Great Britain, employment tribunals are bodies set up to hear specific employment disputes. Private judicial bodies are also often styled 'tribunals'. The word \\"tribunal\\" is not conclusive of a body's function. For example, in Great Britain, the Employment Appeal Tribunal is a superior court of record.    'richard arden' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'occupation'?

If \\"Clown who is looking very sad.\\", does this mean that \\"The clown is looking very happy.\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"Clown who is looking very sad\\" does not imply that \\"The clown is looking very happy.\\" In fact, these two statements have opposite meanings. Let's delve deeper into the meanings and implications the two statements carry. 1. \\"Clown who is looking very sad\\": This statement conveys that the clown in question is displaying a sad or unhappy expression. This could be due to various reasons, such as some unfortunate event in the clown's life, emotional distress, or even an act that aims to express sadness as a part of their performance. It is important to note that despite being a figure of entertainment and a performer meant to evoke laughter and amusement, clowns can also undergo difficult moments and portray emotions beyond happiness or joy. 2. \\"The clown is looking very happy\\": This statement suggests that the clown has a happy or cheerful expression. Typically, we associate clowns with happiness, laughter, and merriment. This statement confirms this association, as it implies that the clown is content or enthusiastic, possibly as a part of their performance or due to their personality. These two statements are contrasting in nature, as they depict opposite emotions experienced or displayed by the clown. The first statement focuses on sadness and a departure from the stereotypes associated with clowns, while the second statement reflects the lively and light-hearted aspects we often expect from clowns. Without any additional context or information, it is impossible to confirm that a sad clown would suddenly appear happy or vice versa. It is important to remember that emotions and expressions can be dynamic and change over time, but one statement does not inherently imply the opposite."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"A corporation balance, usually referred to as a balance sheet, is a financial statement that presents a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It gives an overview of the company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. The balance sheet follows the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity. This equation helps to provide a comprehensive understanding of a corporation's financial health. The statement you provided, \\"A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in hand,\\" is not a suitable answer for corporation balance. This statement describes a simplified method for measuring profits in a cash-based business and does not account for various other factors that contribute to a company's overall financial health. A balance sheet, on the other hand, is more comprehensive and provides a more accurate representation of a corporation's financial position: 1. Assets: These are resources owned by the company that have future economic value. Assets can be divided into current assets (cash, accounts receivable, inventory, etc.) and non-current assets (property, equipment, intangible assets, etc.). 2. Liabilities: These are the obligations or debts a company has to pay to external parties. Liabilities can be classified as current liabilities (accounts payable, short-term debt, etc.) and non-current liabilities (long-term debt, deferred tax liabilities, etc.). 3. Shareholders' Equity: This represents the residual interest in a company's assets after deducting its liabilities. It consists of invested capital (share capital, additional paid-in capital) and retained earnings (accumulated profits not distributed as dividends). A corporation's balance sheet gives a more thorough understanding of its financial health, as it accounts for all assets, liabilities, and equity, rather than just considering cash balances to measure profits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Blood vessels blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to this?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  CHAPTER REVIEW 20.1 Structure and Function of Blood Vessels Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to the heart. Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch into smaller vessels, forming arterioles. Arterioles distribute blood to capillary beds, the sites of exchange with the body tissues. Capillaries lead back to small vessels known as venules that flow into the larger veins and eventually back to the heart. The arterial system is a relatively high-pressure system, so arteries have thick walls that appear round in cross section. The venous system is a lower-pressure system, containing veins that have larger lumens and thinner walls. They often appear flattened. Arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins are composed of three tunics known as the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa. Capillaries have only a tunica intima layer. The tunica intima is a thin layer composed of a simple squamous epithelium known as endothelium and a small amount of connective tissue. The tunica media is a thicker area composed of variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective tissue. It is the thickest layer in all but the largest arteries. The tunica externa is primarily a layer of connective tissue, although in veins, it also contains some smooth muscle. Blood flow through vessels can be dramatically influenced by vasoconstriction and vasodilation in their walls.

Enter the Shoguns: Japan's austere, ruthless, but statesmanlike new ruler, Yoritomo Minamoto, set up his government in Kamakura (just south of modern Tokyo), well away from the \\"softening\\" influence of court life that had been the undoing of his predecessor, Kiyomori. First of the national rulers to take the title of sei-i tai-shogun (\\"barbarian-subduing great general\\"), Minamoto expanded and consolidated his power by confiscating lands from some of the defeated Taira and redistributing them to his samurai vassals. Minamoto died in 1199, and the feudal structure passed intact to the tutelage of his widow's family, the Hojo, who were content to play regent to a figurehead shogun, in much the same way as the Fujiwara had done with the emperor. The fiction of Japanese imperial power had become infinitely extendable. The emperor at Kyoto — still seconded by a Fujiwara regent at court — legitimized a Minamoto who was himself a military dictator controlled by a Hojo regent. In a country where form and substance were inextricably interrelated, two things counted in politics: symbolic authority and real power. Neither could exist without the other. A thwarted Mongol invasion in 1274 weakened the Kamakura regime. The fighting brought none of the usual spoils of war that provincial warlords and samurai had come to expect as payment. And the treasury was empty after earthquake, famine, and plague had crippled the economy. Buddhist monasteries were using their private armies to support imperial ambitions to bring power back to Kyoto. Worst of all, the Kamakura warriors, resenting the way the Kyoto court referred to them as \\"Eastern barbarians,\\" sought refinement in a ruinous taste for luxury: extravagant feasts, rich costumes, and opulent homes.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: All living things on the earth need other living things to live. Nothing lives alone. Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain  . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links   disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil   and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses. Each form of life is linked   to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger. Options: A Animals. B Plants. C Animals and plants.

Question: Process:  - A forest fire starts - The fire surrounds the vicinity - The animals are trapped - Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - The survivors must find a new habitat - Conflict with other animals occur.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Less animals would die in the fire happens, how will it affect a SMALLER negative effect on animals.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would definitely have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. Step 1: Analyze the perturbation. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that fewer animals would die in the fire.  Step 2: Determine the direct effects. Fewer animal deaths in the fire means more animals surviving the immediate disaster.  Step 3: Assess the subsequent actions. If more animals survive the fire, more would have their habitats destroyed and hence would need to find new habitats. Step 4: Determine potential conflicts due to increased survivors. The increase in animals seeking new habitats would likely lead to more competition (for resources) and conflict among animals. Step 5: Consider indirect effects. A less obvious consequence could be the effect on the balance of predator and prey populations, which could have far-reaching consequences for the food chain and the broader ecosystem. Step 6: Abstracting away the consequences. While it initially seems to have a positive effect in terms of fewer immediate animal deaths, in the longer term, it could still lead to substantial individual animal suffering and potential imbalances in the local ecosystem. In conclusion, the assumption that fewer animals would die in the fire indeed has a direct effect on number of survivors who have to deal with their destroyed habitat and indirectly influences the post-fire ecosystem balance potentially negatively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He noticed that patient A's blood vessels are constricted, but blood vessels of patient B are dilated. He needs to prescribe medicine according to his observation.  Would patient B's blood vessels be narrower or wider than patient A's?  Hint: Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels. Answer:","output":"Patient B's blood vessels would be wider than patient A's. This is because patient B's blood vessels are dilated, which means the walls have relaxed and have allowed for an increased blood flow.

Fact 2: Sound Sound waves are mechanical waves.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What can vibrating matter cause?\\" with the following options:  - electromagnetic energy  - Relieve pain  - nothing  - loss of matter  - destruction of matter  - mechanical waves  - Electrical energy  - kinetic energy The answer is:","output":"Given the two facts provided - Fact 1: Matter vibrating can cause sound, and Fact 2: Sound waves are mechanical waves - we can deduce that vibrating matter can cause mechanical waves. When matter vibrates, it produces sound waves by compressing and expanding the surrounding particles or molecules. These waves propagate through the medium in which the vibrations occur, such as air, water, or solid materials. Sound waves are a type of mechanical wave, as they require a medium to travel and involve the transfer of energy from one particle to the next via vibrations and collisions. Mechanical waves, such as sound waves, differ from electromagnetic waves because they require a medium to travel, while electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum. Both, however, involve the transfer of energy from one point to another. Regarding the other options: - Electromagnetic energy: Vibrating matter does not directly cause electromagnetic energy. Electromagnetic waves are created by oscillating electric and magnetic fields and can travel through a vacuum, unlike mechanical waves. - Relieve pain: Vibrating matter does not inherently relieve pain. However, applications of vibration therapy in medicine may help alleviate pain by stimulating nerve receptors and relaxing muscles. - Nothing: Vibrating matter can indeed produce sound waves, which are mechanical waves, so this option is incorrect. - Loss of matter: Vibrating matter does not typically result in the loss of matter. However, in specific, extreme circumstances (e.g., with high-energy vibrations), some matter might be dislodged or eroded. - Destruction of matter: Vibrating matter does not generally cause the destruction of matter, although specific instances may involve localized destruction, such as in the case of ultrasonic cavitation. - Electrical energy: Vibrating matter does not directly cause electrical energy, though certain materials can generate electrical charges due to vibrations or mechanical stress, a phenomenon known as piezoelectricity. - Kinetic energy: Although vibrating matter does involve kinetic energy, as particles in motion possess kinetic energy, the answer \\"mechanical waves\\" is more precise and accurate in this context, as it directly refers to the phenomenon caused by vibrating matter. In conclusion, based on the two facts presented, the answer is that vibrating matter can cause mechanical waves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Jesse?\\", is \\"hygenic\\" a valid answer? Options: [1]. Yes; [2]. No; Answer:","output":"Answer: [1]. Yes Jesse's decision to take a bath right after getting home can be seen as an indication of being hygienic. Hygiene refers to the set of practices and habits that help maintain good health and prevent the spread of diseases by keeping oneself and one's surroundings clean. In this context, taking a bath after being outdoors or upon returning home is generally considered a hygienic practice. Therefore, describing Jesse as \\"hygienic\\" would be a valid answer. Being hygienic involves various personal habits and practices, such as regular bathing, washing hands frequently and thoroughly, brushing teeth, and keeping living spaces clean and organized. These habits help in reducing the risk of infections and other illnesses caused by germs, bacteria, and viruses. The fact that Jesse takes a bath right after getting home may not provide a complete understanding of all his personal habits; however, it does provide some insight into his adherence to hygienic practices. Moreover, taking a bath after returning home could mean that Jesse is also aware of the importance of cleanliness for his overall well-being. He may have been exposed to dirt, sweat, or other contaminants throughout the day, and by showering or bathing after coming home, he is making efforts to remove these impurities from his body. By doing so, he demonstrates a proactive approach towards his personal hygiene and cleanliness. Therefore, it is fair to consider \\"hygienic\\" a valid way to describe Jesse based on the information provided about him taking a bath after getting home. However, in a broader context, it would be beneficial to know more about Jesse's overall habits and practices to gain a more comprehensive understanding of his hygiene habits as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: To allow for agricultural development of the Great Plains and house a growing population, the US passed the Homestead Acts of 1862: it allowed a settler to claim up to 160 acres (65 ha) of land, provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it. The provisions were expanded under the Kinkaid Act of 1904 to include a homestead of an entire section. Hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads, sometimes building sod houses out of the very turf of their land. Many of them were not skilled dryland farmers and failures were frequent. Much of the Plains were settled during relatively wet years. Government experts did not understand how farmers should cultivate the prairies and gave advice counter to what would have worked[citation needed]. Germans from Russia who had previously farmed, under similar circumstances, in what is now Ukraine were marginally more successful than other homesteaders. The Dominion Lands Act of 1871 served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in Canada.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Bobby and Will were two friends attending a genetics course.  Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species.  and a hint : Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer provided does not accurately address the question about who built the San Juan Capistrano Mission. The mission was founded by Father Junípero Serra, a Spanish Franciscan friar, on November 1, 1776, in what is now the city of San Juan Capistrano, California. It was part of a larger endeavor led by the Spanish colonizers to establish a series of religious and military outposts known as the California Missions along the coast of what is now the state of California. The primary purpose of the California Missions, including the San Juan Capistrano Mission, was to convert the Native American populations to Christianity and assimilate them into the Spanish colonial society. In terms of construction, the mission buildings were primarily built by Native American laborers under the supervision of Spanish padres and soldiers. The mission complex included a church, living quarters for the padres and Native American converts, granaries, workshops, and other facilities necessary for supporting a flourishing settlement. The original stone church at the San Juan Capistrano Mission was built between 1797 and 1806, featuring a large bell tower and a grand interior. Unfortunately, a massive earthquake in 1812 destroyed much of the church and led to the death of more than 40 Native American worshippers who were attending a service at the time. In conclusion, the San Juan Capistrano Mission was founded by Father Junípero Serra and the Spanish colonizers, and primarily built by local Native American laborers under the direction of the Spanish padres and soldiers.

In the first quarter, the Vikings trailed early as Brett Favre threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings, surpassing Dan Marino with the 421st touchdown pass of his career. After Favre was honored for his accomplishment, Minnesota narrowed the margin between the two teams to a single point with field goals of 44 and 35 yards from kicker Ryan Longwell, before Mason Crosby hit a 28-yard field goal to restore a four-point lead for the Packers going into halftime. In the third quarter, Crosby and Longwell cancelled each other out with field goals from 44 yards and 48 yards, respectively.

Cross-Eyed Opossum a Star in Germany BERLIN – Heidi, the cross-eyed opossum, is the latest creature to rocket from Germany's front pages to international recognition, capturing the world's imagination with her bright, black eyes turned toward her pointed pink nose. Since the first photos were published in December, the marsupial from Leipzig Zoo has attracted more Facebook fans than Chancellor Angela Merkel. By Wednesday more than 111,000 fans from as far away as Bangkok and Montreal and clear across Europe were exclaiming \\"so cute!!\\" and \\"so sweet.\\" Experts say that like Knut, Berlin's famous fluffy white polar cub who was abandoned by his mother, and Paul, the late octopus who correctly predicted the outcome of all of Germany's 2010 World Cup games and Spain's victory in the final, the hype surrounding Heidi is fed by a human weakness for cuddly looking critters and the ability of modern mass media to spread images around the globe instantly. Bangkok resident Julie Queen-Vichitthanarurk said she heard about Heidi on the local radio station on the way to work, and raced home to find a picture on the Internet and become a \\"fan\\" on Facebook. \\"Right away when I saw her picture, I feel in love with her!\\" the 40-year-old told The Associated Press in an Facebook message. \\"There is just something so sweet about her that made my heart melt.\\" It is exactly that feeling that humans crave, making such \\"cute\\" animal images so popular. \\"It triggers a reaction in our unconsciousness, when we see these creatures that make us think of children,\\" said Peter Walschburger, a biological psychologist at Berlin's Free University. \\"Animals are so innocent -- in a way that we no longer are,\\" said media expert Steffen Damm. \\"They remind us of our lost connection to nature.\\" Leipzig Zoo insisted the \\"media resonance was surprising and not planned,\\" but it has nevertheless moved to protect the rights to her name and cross-eyed image -- believed to be the result of pressure on her eyes created by fatty deposits. The zoo says the squint doesn't hurt her. Heidi first attracted attention after a local TV report about her upcoming home -- a new nocturnal enclosure in the tropical environment -- featured her as one of several animals in quarantine until it opens July 1. She will share her enclosure with her sister Naira and their male companion, Teddy. All three arrived at Leipzig Zoo on May 5, 2010. \\"She definitively won't be Germany's next Super Opossum,\\" zookeeper Michael Eisner told MDR television, as Heidi squinted up at him from a cage for a documentary about the zoo in December. He couldn't have been more wrong. The clip attracted so much attention on the Internet, the station has developed 10 episodes featuring Heidi and a local stuffed animal manufacture, Koesen, has adapted its line of plush opossums to include a white one with black ears and, of course, crossed-eyes. While Leipzig Zoo says it is not actively engaging in marketing at this time, the attention will most certainly boost admittance, and thus revenue. The Berlin Zoo recorded a 27 percent jump in 2007, the first year of polar bear cub, Knut, whose image as a playful cotton-puff ball of bear fuzz captured hearts around the world. That included U.S. star photographer Annie Liebowitz, who snapped him for an environment issue of Vanity Fair. The attention brought nearly euro6.8 million (then 10.7 million) in revenue. Some animal rights activists, however, maintain the attention is a further form of abuse of animals that are already suffering from their captivity. \\"These animals are put on show for millions of people, but afterward they remain incurably crippled,\\" said Edmund Haferbeck, an animal expert with Germany's branch of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He said he could not name a case where animals benefited from the hype created by the media attention -- including Knut, whom he said still languishes in an enclosure much too small for him. \\"On the contrary, it is completely counterproductive,\\" Haferbeck said. \\"The money they generate is not put toward improving the zoo, but go into their (strapped) budgets.\\" Not every animal is able to generate such interest. Nuremberg zoo, in southern Germany sought to create attention similar to that generated by Knut when it found itself with a polar cub of its own, Flocke, born in December 2007. But she never really created hype. Nor did another polar cub, Willbaer, or an attempt by the Chemnitz Zoo during the 2006 World Cup to have its animals predict the outcome of games -- attributed to elements of timing, how an animal's particular story or affliction is able to hit the public's nerve at any given moment, a pattern known to humans for centuries. \\"It recalls ancient Rome, where exotic species were applauded in the Circus Maximus,\\" said Damm. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Heidi, the cross-eyed opossum from Leipzig Zoo in Germany, has become an international sensation, amassing a significant following on social media, outranking even Chancellor Angela Merkel in terms of Facebook fans. This phenomenon has been attributed to humans' fondness for adorable-looking animals and the efficiency of modern media in disseminating images globally. Zoos often benefit financially from the popularity of such animals, as seen with a significant rise in admissions and revenues at Berlin Zoo during the peak of Knut the polar bear's fame. However, some animal rights activists argue that such attention is detrimental to the animals and can result in neglect or improper care."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Given a comment text in Tamil, classify the comment into one of these categories (i) Hope speech, if it contains encouraging, positive or supportive contents about equality, diversity or inclusion, (ii) Not Hope Speech or (iii) Not in Expected Language, if the text is not Tamil.

Summarize this article: JOHANNESBURG — Former President Nelson Mandela, who has been hospitalized since Saturday, has had a recurrence of a lung infection and is responding to treatment, the office of South Africa’s current president, Jacob Zuma, announced Tuesday.      It was the first indication of Mr. Mandela’s medical condition since he was flown to Pretoria and taken to a hospital for unspecified tests over the weekend.      It is his second hospitalization this year; in February he was checked into a hospital for tests to address a chronic stomach complaint, the government said at the time.      He was released after minor diagnostic surgery, officials said.      Mr. Mandela, who is 94 and increasingly frail, was “receiving appropriate treatment and he is responding to the treatment,” according to Mr. Zuma’s office.      The current stay in the hospital is the longest in recent memory, raising fears that Mr. Mandela’s condition is grave.      Government officials have been upbeat about his prognosis while offering few details about his condition. Given his age, any infection is by its nature serious, medical experts say.      Photo      “I’m not sure we should press the panic button every single time a man of his age has the sniffles,” Mark Sonderup, vice chairman at the South African Medical Association, told The Mail and Guardian, a weekly newspaper, this week.      “But unfortunately,” he added, “we have to accept that simple health matters for a person of that age can turn very serious, very quickly.”      Mr. Mandela, South Africa’s first black president, has had respiratory ailments for years, in part owing to the 27 years he spent in prison, most of it on Robben Island, working in a bleak quarry.      He was given a diagnosis of tuberculosis in 1988 and had fluid drained from his lungs.      Mr. Mandela retired from public life some years ago, and he was last seen publicly at the celebrations for the World Cup soccer tournament, which South Africa hosted in 2010, although he receives frequent visits from old friends and visiting dignitaries.      In January 2011, he was hospitalized for an acute respiratory infection, and the news of that illness set off a panic about his health.      When Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited South Africa in August, she stopped by Mr. Mandela’s home in the rural village of Qunu to see him. In a photograph of the two of them, Mr. Mandela beamed his trademark grin, but looked frail seated in an armchair and dressed in a gray cardigan.      Mr. Mandela led the African National Congress to a resounding victory in the first fully democratic elections in South Africa’s history in 1994, after negotiating a peaceful transition from white rule. Despite harsh treatments at the hands of the apartheid government, Mr. Mandela advocated forgiveness and reconciliation, making him an icon of peacemaking the world over.      After a single term as president, Mr. Mandela retired from politics in 1999. ||||| Frail Nelson Mandela's 'sparkle fading': wife      (AFP) – Dec 11, 2012      JOHANNESBURG — Ailing anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela was Tuesday spending a fourth day in hospital for more tests, as his wife said his trademark \\"sparkle\\" was waning.      Looking calm in an interview with a local television network, Graca Machel did not give details about Mandela's health status, just saying it was painful to see the nonagenarian \\"aging\\".      \\"I mean, this spirit and this sparkle, you see that somehow it's fading,\\" she told ENews Central Africa (ENCA) on Monday in her first interview since Mandela was hospitalised at the weekend.      South African government officials have said the former president is comfortable and does not face immediate danger, but they refuse to speculate on when he is likely to be discharged from a Pretoria military hospital.      Mandela, 94, was at the weekend admitted to hospital for tests that authorities say are expected of people of his age.      \\"To see him aging, it's something also which pains you. . . . You understand and you know it has to happen,\\" said Graca.      Mandela's grand-daughter Ndileka told the same TV network that he has taken to accept his condition.      \\"I think he takes it in his strides, he has come to accept that it's part of growing old, and it's part of humanity as such. At some point you will dependent on someone else, he has come to embrace it,\\" she said.      Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula visited Mandela on Monday and said the revered statesman was \\"doing very, very well\\".

Alongside the terrible loss of life, numerous people remain unaccounted for, with the AP estimating approximately 40 individuals, and Reuters suggesting an updated figure closer to 50. The disaster has had a profound impact on the community, with a need for supportive actions to help identify victims and establish the cause of the accident. Forensic teams are now closely examining the bodies discovered thus far, with the coroner requesting DNA samples from the families of those still missing. This critical information will aid authorities in the identification process, providing much-needed closure for grief-stricken families in the Lac-Megantic area. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited the town of Lac-Megantic recently, expressing shock at the devastation caused by the derailment. The aftermath led him to describe the scene as a \\"war zone.\\" Upon witnessing the disaster, Harper pledged a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the accident and ensure that those responsible are held accountable, the BBC reports. According to official statements, the derailment led to the destruction of around 30 buildings in the town of Lac-Megantic. The extent of the damage has significantly impacted locals, with many beginning to question the safety of oil train transportation. As such, the investigation launched by Canadian authorities will hopefully offer some insight into the accident's causes and potential preventative measures. As the small community of Lac-Megantic grapples with the unfathomable loss in the wake of the oil train derailment, families and friends are left waiting for answers and facing the conclusive identification of victims. The incident raises questions about the safety of oil transportation by rail and the need for stricter regulations to prevent future accidents. The Canadian government, under the guidance of Prime Minister Harper, is now committed to uncovering the causes of the accident and seeking justice for those impacted by this profound tragedy. In conclusion, the Quebec oil train derailment has sent shockwaves through the small town of Lac-Megantic, with a rising death toll that now stands at 13 and the possibility of many more victims yet to be found. As families and friends of the missing anxiously await further information, Canadian authorities are working diligently to identify the victims and unearthing the cause of the disaster. The resulting investigation, described as rigorous by Prime Minister Harper, will hopefully ensure further safety measures are implemented to avoid such catastrophic events in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To get this effect, start by pouring some tonic water into a container where you can see it. You can add it by itself or dilute it with water. However, the more water you add, the dimmer it will glow. Tonic water is available at most local stores and supermarkets for just a few dollars. Be sure to get tonic water, not club soda or soda water. The bottle should say \\"with quinine\\" or something similar. All you need to do to get tonic water to glow bright is to illuminate it with a black light. Be sure to dim the lights in the room before you do this or it will be more difficult to see the glowing effect. Black lights are available from specialty party stores (like Spencer's, etc.) or online. The price for the black light often depends on its size and brightness — basic lights can cost as little as 20 or less. Making tonic water glow with a black light makes it look very strange, but it doesn't make it poisonous, radioactive, or harmful to drink in any other way. However, tonic water is often high in calories and sugar, so enjoy it sparingly. Tonic water glows this way because of tiny chemicals called \\"phosphors\\" inside the liquid. When ultraviolet light from the black light (which humans can't see) hits the phosphors, they convert it into a form that humans can see, producing the glow.","output":"The article explains how to make tonic water glow under a black light by illuminating it with the light, and also mentions that it is safe to drink while highlighting the phosphors' role in producing the glow."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If back pain is confirmed, the vet may suggest imaging to check what is causing the pain. Sources of pain include disc disease, spinal arthritis, spondylitis (infection in the vertebra), inflammatory nerve disease, muscle sprains and strains. A diagnostic test commonly used at veterinary clinics is to take x-rays of the spine. Each section of the back is x-rayed in turn (depending on where the suspected damage is), such as the neck, chest, and lower back.  Two views are usually taken of each area so as to provide a cross reference: One view taken from the side (the lateral) and one from above or below (the dorso-ventral or ventro-dorsal).  Radiography can provide helpful information about the bones of the spine and the spaces between them, but it cannot provide a picture of the spinal cord itself. For this more advanced imaging methods are needed. A limitation of x-rays is they can be misleading. For example, a narrowed space between two vertebra is abnormal and suggest that the disc is diseased. However, the disc may have ruptured harmlessly to one side and avoided pressurizing the spinal cord. Thus, x-rays can give a clues, which can be interpreted in the light of clinical signs as giving a diagnosis. More sophisticated imaging techniques, where available, have taken over from x-rays. These sophisticated techniques can visualize the spinal cord itself. Thus if a disc has prolapsed into the spine, the clinician will be able to see the \\"waistline\\" in the spine where it is compressed.  This is vital information if specialist decompression surgery is being considered, as it allows the surgeon to know exactly which discs are involved, so they operate in the correct place.  Unfortunately, MRI and CT scans are costly. In addition, the dog also needs to be anesthetized so that it keeps still in the scanner. This will have an additional cost, as well as a further health risk for the dog. What is a summary?","output":"A vet checks a dog for back pain and nerve damage by doing a physical examination, touching the spine, and testing paw and toe reactions. If back pain is found, they might take x-rays or use more advanced imaging techniques like MRI or CT scans to find the cause, such as disc disease or muscle strains. These tests can be expensive and sometimes require the dog to be anesthetized."},{"instruction":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What is invisible to the human eye?\\" is in \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears.

The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its child protagonists, forest setting, and the discovery of a castle's ruins. Yet at its core, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. Opening with a dream sequence employing the not-so-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound, the film details his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who has pledged her love to him, and his eventual romance with the equally malicious Sylvia. The film's psychological complexities do give the film merit, yet there's no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex. The film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill, and there's no doubting the film's greatest asset is the creepy, children's choir-augmented soundtrack. With its odd dreamlike quality, the film is at best interesting, yet pales beside Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' from the same era. Certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate, for unlike many banned films, Pasolini's 'Salo' or Larry Clark's 'Ken Park' for instance, the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release.

A flood occurs when a river overflows its banks. This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge.  After reading the above, is \\"A flood plain area of land is good for growing crops\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What is the flood plain area of land good for if it floods often?\\"? Choices: (a). no; (b). yes;","output":"(b). yes The statement \\"A flood plain area of land is good for growing crops\\" is indeed correct in reference to the passage provided.

The Nile River valley serves as an excellent example, where crops can be raised amidst a sandy desert due to the fertile soil left behind by the annual flooding of the Nile River. Furthermore, natural levees which form along the river banks contribute to the sediment deposit and soil fertility in the floodplain areas.

Please answer the following question: Being exposed to wind can cause erosion of soil, and soil erosion causes crop yields to decrease. Given these facts, what is a possible negative effect of exposing soil to wind  among the following options: - It used to be covered by water  - exposure to cold  - decrease in crop yields  - greater food production  - elimination of harmful pests  - a tree falling  - wind power increases  - Damages them Answer:","output":"Among the given options, the negative effect of exposing soil to wind would be a decrease in crop yields. When soil is exposed to wind, the wind can erode the top layers of soil, which is a negative process for several reasons.  Firstly, the top layer of soil is usually the most fertile, with higher concentrations of nutrients and organic matter that are critical for healthy plant growth. As the wind erodes the soil, these nutrients become depleted, resulting in poorer soil quality, which can adversely impact crop growth and ultimately lead to lower crop yields. Secondly, soil erosion can cause harmful sedimentation of nearby water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. As soil particles are carried away by the wind and deposited into these bodies of water, it may disrupt the aquatic ecosystem and lead to declines in biodiversity. This can have indirect negative effects on crop production, as some of these aquatic species play essential roles in maintaining a balanced ecosystem that supports agriculture. Lastly, soil erosion can lead to changes in soil structure, making it more difficult for crops to establish strong root systems. Poorly developed root systems can cause plants to be more susceptible to drought, disease, and other stress factors that may reduce crop yields further. In conclusion, exposing soil to wind has the potential to cause a decrease in crop yields due to the various negative consequences of soil erosion. Soil erosion can lead to the depletion of essential nutrients, disruption of aquatic ecosystems, and compromised root systems, all of which negatively impact crop growth and contribute to reduced agricultural production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: From James Dean to Growing Pains, Hollywood has long had a love affair with the relationship between teens and their parents. As the fascination with this relationship attests, parents play a crucial role in the development of their children's personalities.     Teenagers learn by closely observing what people around them do. Parents are literally their first teachers and serve as role models. From hygiene to habits, from time management to personal manner, parents form the foundation of their children's characteristics. These tiny individual factors on our everyday behavior collectively constitute who we are.     A second influence occurs at the spiritual level. Parental treatment of children is reflected in children's relationship with others. For example, my dad was quite angry with my study habits a few years back and lost his temper.I clearly remember that I too would easily lose my cool and shout at people, often saying things I later regretted, in those difficult days.     Parents of my fellow classmates often tend to be anxious about the studies of their children, which can lead to a lack of confidence in their children. If we are boats weathering a storm as we navigate toward maturity, then parents should be our captains. It is as easy to lead us to shipwreck as is to take us ashore safely.     To be fair, the guidance and influence of our parents are not the sole factors in molding us. There are numerous examples of teens forging their own paths and becoming something of which their parents never dreamed. Even so, parents must be a fundamental force that positively influences their children. At their best, they can help to solve teenage problems with a respect for their children's thoughts.

See options at the end Adam likes to fish and hunt at the campsite while Craig hides in the tent because  Pick from: (I) Adam hates being in nature. (II) Craig hates being in nature.","output":"Craig hates being in nature. So the complete sentence is: Adam likes to fish and hunt at the campsite while Craig hides in the tent because Craig hates being in nature. Now let us examine the personalities and preferences of Adam and Craig in order to understand their behaviors and choices better. Adam is an outdoor enthusiast, who revels in the opportunity to connect with nature and the wilderness. He thoroughly enjoys activities like fishing and hunting, which provide him not only with a sense of adventure but also the opportunity to practice his survival skills. For Adam, spending time at the campsite is a welcome break from daily routine and a way to recharge his batteries. He cherishes the sense of accomplishment that comes from catching a fish or successfully tracking and hunting an animal, and he values the lessons that nature imparts about resilience, resourcefulness, and adaptability. In contrast, Craig has an aversion to nature and the outdoors. He might find the unpredictability of wilderness unsettling or be overwhelmed by the sensory experiences that come with camping. It's likely that he's more comfortable in familiar surroundings, like the spaces that he has carefully nurtured and curated according to his own needs and preferences. Because Craig hates being in nature, he chooses to hide in the tent when he accompanies Adam to the campsite. His refuge might be due to practical concerns, like wanting to avoid insect bites, or it could be a form of psychological safety, helping to create a buffer between himself and the elements that he finds so disconcerting. The discrepancy between Adam and Craig's preferences can be attributed to various factors, such as their upbringing, past experiences, and innate predispositions. It is possible that Adam grew up in a family that encouraged outdoor activities and fostered a love for nature, while Craig might have been raised in an urban environment that led him to prioritize indoor activities and seek solace in human-made spaces. Experiences like an unfortunate encounter with wildlife, getting lost in a forest, or failing to adapt to harsh weather conditions could have contributed to Craig's aversion to nature. Moreover, some people are simply more innately inclined towards one environment over another due to their genetics or personality traits. Despite their contrasting preferences, Adam and Craig could ideally learn from each other and find a balance in their approach to the outdoors. Adam could help Craig develop an appreciation for nature by introducing him to less challenging activities that he might enjoy, such as bird-watching, stargazing, or leisurely nature walks. On the other hand, Craig could teach Adam the benefits of embracing indoor spaces and activities, for example, by sharing his hobbies or engaging in productive conversations away from the distractions of a busy world. In conclusion, Adam and Craig are two distinct individuals with opposing preferences when it comes to nature and the outdoors. While Adam is an outdoor enthusiast who loves engaging in activities like fishing and hunting, Craig strongly dislikes being in nature and chooses to hide in the tent while at the campsite. Their preferences might be based on various factors like upbringing, prior experiences, and innate tendencies. However, both could learn to accommodate each other's differences and strike a balanced relationship between nature and indoor spaces, ultimately enriching their bond and expanding their horizons."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  - three  - five  - seven  - four  A: Answer:","output":"A: There are five visual clues to indicate a chemical reaction. These clues are: 1. Color change: A significant change in color can be observed when a chemical reaction occurs. For example, when copper reacts with nitric acid, it turns from reddish-brown to a blue-green solution. 2. Formation of a precipitate: A chemical reaction might cause the formation of a solid substance, also known as a precipitate, when two soluble reactants are mixed. For example, mixing silver nitrate and sodium chloride solutions results in the formation of a white precipitate of silver chloride. 3. Formation of a gas: A chemical reaction might produce a gas, which can be observed as bubbles forming in the reacting mixture. For example, the reaction between vinegar (acetic acid) and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) creates carbon dioxide gas, which causes fizzing and bubbling. 4. Release or absorption of heat: Some chemical reactions release heat (exothermic reactions), while others absorb heat (endothermic reactions). For example, burning fuel is an exothermic reaction, as it releases heat, whereas dissolving ammonium chloride in water is an endothermic reaction, as it absorbs heat and the mixture becomes cold. 5. Change in odor: A chemical reaction may release new or different odors that were not present originally. For example, the reaction between hydrogen sulfide gas and oxygen produces water and sulfur dioxide, which has a distinct smell different from the initial reactants. These visual clues can help indicate that a chemical reaction has taken place."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Supreme Court has rebuffed Virginia's request to reinstate the death sentence of a convicted killer who claims he is too mentally disabled to be executed.      The justices on Monday did not comment in letting stand lower court rulings that threw out the sentence of death for Leon Winston, convicted in the shooting deaths of Anthony and Rhonda Robinson in 2002. Rhonda Robinson, who was pregnant, was shot to death in front of her 4- and 8-year-old daughters.      The lower court concluded that Winston's lawyers did not try hard enough to show Winston was mentally disabled, and thus, ineligible to be executed under a 2002 Supreme Court ruling.      The case is Pearson v. Winston, 12-492. ||||| The U.S. Supreme Court turned away an appeal by two men accused of illegally channeling more than 150,000 in corporate money to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign.      William P. Danielczyk Jr. and Eugene R. Biagi argued unsuccessfully that part of their indictment violated the constitutional free-speech guarantee and a 2010 Supreme Court decision that let corporations spend unlimited sums on elections.      In rejecting the appeal today without comment, the high court declined a chance to expand the 2010 ruling, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, and allow direct corporate contributions to political candidates.      The court said last week it will consider a different campaign-finance issue during the nine-month term that starts in October. In that case, Republicans are challenging federal limits on the total amount of money individuals can give to candidates, political parties and political committees every two years.      Danielczyk and Biagi are accused of using funds from Galen Capital Corp. to reimburse so-called straw donors who gave money to Clinton’s campaign. Danielczyk was the chairman of Galen, based in McLean, Virginia, and Biagi was its secretary.      A federal trial judge threw out one of the seven charges against the two men, saying the Citizens United decision meant that companies can make campaign donations directly to candidates as long as they comply with general legal limits.      A federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, disagreed, saying the majority in the Citizens United case explicitly declined to allow corporate contributions.      The indictment, which covers Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid and 2006 Senate run, also charges Danielczyk and Biagi with conspiracy, obstruction of justice and causing false statements.

Options: - liquid nitrogen - steam room - tidal waves - ocean - crushed ice The answer to this question is:","output":"crushed ice To make your cup of water colder, using crushed ice is the most suitable and practical option among the ones provided. Crushed ice absorbs heat from the water by creating a cold environment, thereby cooling down the water. Here's a detailed explanation of how you can go about cooling your water using crushed ice: 1. Gather crushed ice: Crushed ice can be obtained by using an ice crusher or by placing ice cubes in a sturdy bag and tapping it gently with a hammer or rolling pin. You can also purchase ready-to-use crushed ice from a store. Alternatively, you may use an ice maker machine to produce crushed ice. 2. Pre-chill your cup: Before adding water and crushed ice, it's better to pre-chill your cup. This can be done by placing it in the refrigerator for at least 15-30 minutes prior to use. This step helps in maintaining a colder temperature for your water for an extended period. 3. Mix crushed ice and water: Half-fill your pre-chilled cup with crushed ice, then pour your water onto the ice. The crushed ice will immediately start to absorb heat from the water, causing the water temperature to drop. Ideally, you should use water that is already cool or at room temperature as this will require less energy from the ice to cool. 4. Stir the mixture: Use a spoon or straw to gently stir the water and crushed ice together. This will help the heat transfer process and ensure that the cold temperature is evenly distributed throughout the water. As the ice melts, it will further cool the water by diluting it with cold meltwater. 5. Add more crushed ice: If the water still isn't cold enough to your liking, feel free to add more crushed ice and stir again until you're satisfied with the temperature. 6. Enjoy your cold cup of water: Once you've achieved the desired temperature, enjoy your refreshing cup of chilled water! To maintain the cold temperature for a longer period, you can minimize heat transfer by using a cup with insulated walls or covering it with a coaster or lid. In conclusion, crushed ice is the most suitable and accessible option for cooling down your cup of water. By following the steps mentioned above, you can effectively lower the water's temperature and enjoy a chilled beverage. Other options such as liquid nitrogen, steam rooms, tidal waves, and oceans are either dangerous, impractical, or not directly applicable to cooling your cup of water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the questions at the end based on the text. London, England (CNN) -- Former Bosnian leader Ejup Ganic will not be extradited to Serbia, a British court ruled Tuesday, setting him free.  Ganic called the extradition request \\"a textbook example of abuse,\\" accusing the Serbian government of trying to \\"undermine the judiciary in this country.\\"  The extradition request was politically motivated, Justice Timothy Workman found in throwing it out.  \\"No striking or substantial new evidence\\" was brought against him, the judge ruled.  Ganic, who was arrested at England's Heathrow Airport in March at Serbia's request, is wanted in Serbia for conspiracy to murder in breach of the Geneva Conventions, a spokesman at Britain's Foreign Office said.  Ganic's lawyer, Stephen Gentle, denied that he had any role in the 1992 killings in question. In April, Gentle said that \\"the extradition request is politically motivated. It is legally flawed, and he has nothing to hide.\\"  Ganic was the vice president of Bosnia during the civil war there between 1992 and 1995 and was twice president of the Bosnian-Croat Federation in the years following the 1995 Dayton peace agreement. Many independent commentators at the time regarded Ganic as a relative moderate in the wartime Bosnian leadership.  Though Bosnian, Ganic was born in Serbia and speaks with a recognizable Serbian accent. He holds dual nationality in the former Yugoslav republics.

Given the question: Process:  - Batteries are put in a flashlight - The flashlight is turned on - Two contact strips touch one another - A circuit is completed between the batteries and the lamp - The lamp in the flashlight begins to glow - The reflector in the flashlight directs the lamp's beam - A straight beam of light is generated - The flashlight is turned off - The circuit is broken - The beam is no longer visible.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the strips are not broken happens, how will it affect better flashlight usage.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have a significant effect on the process.  The role of the contact strips inside a flashlight is crucial for its working mechanism. They carry the electric current from the battery to the lamp, completing the circuit. When the flashlight is turned on, it makes the two contact strips meet, closing the circuit and allowing the electricity to flow through the bulb, causing it to light up.  If the strips are not separated (\\"not broken\\") when the flashlight is turned off, the circuit will not be broken. This would mean that electricity continues to flow from the battery to the lamp, causing the bulb to stay lit even when the flashlight switch is set to off. This situation will continue until the battery power is depleted.  This perturbation would negatively affect the better usage of a flashlight because it prevents the device from being turned off, leading to a waste of battery power and reducing the useful lifespan of both the bulb and the batteries. In short, the ability to \\"break\\" or \\"open\\" the circuit by separating the contact strips is necessary for proper control of the flashlight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He said it's obvious Richard \\"Gary\\" Black saved the life of his grandson and protected other members of his family before getting shot by an officer.      Metz said the department will not release body-worn camera video or the 911 audio recording of the incident. He said there was an issue with clarity regarding some of the recordings.      The district attorney's office has asked the release of the video be withheld. The family wrote a letter to the Aurora Police Department that Metz read during the news conference.      Please enable Javascript to watch this video      In the letter, they asked that the body-cam video and the 911 call recordings not be released at this time.      \\"The family desires space to grieve and does not wish to have the family in violent moments of Gary’s distinguished life be his public legacy,\\" the letter said.      Metz said he will order an independent forensic review of body cam footage and 911 call surrounding Black’s death.      Metz said Black's family watched the body-cam video and they also listened to the 911 recording.      The suspect in the home invasion, 26-year-old Dajon Harper, was at party across the street from Black’s home and became “out of control,” Metz said.      He started damaging cars in the neighborhood. Multiple calls came into 911.      Metz said Harper somehow knocked the door to Black’s home off its hinges. Once inside, Harper grabbed Black’s 11-year-old grandchild and put the him in a bathroom and violently assaulted the child.      Speaking about one of the 911 calls, Metz said there was no physical description given to 911 of what the suspect looked like.      The caller said the suspect was in the bathroom and there was lots of blood everywhere.      Police did release a recording of dispatchers communicating with officers.      Metz said there was upward of 10 people inside Black's home when police arrived. He said people came in to try to get the intruder out.      Metz then described what is shown on the officer's body-worn camera. There were numerous people outside the house with lots of yelling with people saying a child is being hurt.      Black's wife told officers, \\"He has a gun,\\" and then shots are heard inside the home. This was shot within 33 seconds of arrival.      Metz said officers saw Black walking with a gun and flashlight.      Officers say they gave \\"at least five commands\\" to tell Black to drop the gun. Black raised the flashlight. Metz said it was at that time the officer fired four rounds at Black and he fell to the ground.      Metz said Black had \\"significant hearing impairment\\" from his time in the military.      The attorney for the family has said Black's wife gave a detailed description of Black to police.      Metz acknowledges she was involved in a stressful situation. Metz said a review of the 911 tapes found no description given of Gary Black.      Metz said two minutes and 27 seconds went by from when police arrived at the home to when they entered the bathroom in the home where the boy was injured, and Harper was dead.      The police chief said the officer ran into \\"an incredibly dangerous\\" situation. The officer has been with department for three years and is a military veteran. He described the officer as heartbroken.      The same officer was involved in another shooting on June 27 in the 8900 block of East Colfax Avenue. He returned to duty 18 days later after completing all requirements needed to return.      \\"Officers responded how I would expect them to respond in that situation ... they put themselves in harm's way to save lives,\\" Metz said.      Police released recordings of police dispatch conversations and some 911 call recordings.      Warning: The graphic nature and language used in some of the audio may not be appropriate for all listeners. ||||| The Purple Heart and Bronze Star recipient who was killed by Colorado police after he saved his grandson from a home intruder did not follow officers' orders to drop his gun, Aurora Police Chief Nicholas Metz said in a press conference Thursday.      Richard \\"Gary\\" Black, 73, shot and killed the suspect, 26-year-old Dajon Harper, as Harper allegedly \\"violently and seriously\\" assaulted Black's 11-year-old grandson in the bathroom of the Aurora home early Monday morning, Metz said.      Officers heard shots fired inside the home within three minutes of arriving on the scene, Metz said. When Black came into view, they observed that he had a firearm and instructed him multiple times to \\"the drop gun and to show his hands,\\" Metz said.      After the shooting, investigators learned from Black's family that the Vietnam War veteran had \\"a significant hearing impairment.\\"      \\"I don’t know what he was able to hear and not hear,\\" Metz said.      About 3 days after the shooting, Metz, having reviewed the body camera footage and 911 dispatch calls, shared more details on what transpired early Monday morning when Black was killed.      A house party gone wrong      Police began receiving 911 calls around 1:30 a.m. Monday from a house party Harper attended across the street from Black's home. The calls detailed that Harper had become \\"out of control,\\" Metz said.      Harper had been \\"acting irrationally\\" and damaged cars in the area, and even injured himself in the process, Metz said.      Aurora Police Department      It was difficult to get information from the callers at that point due to the commotion, Metz said. One person who hung up and was called back by emergency dispatchers told them, \\"I don't know where I am. Just get here,\\" Metz said.      At that point, there was \\"still no description provided to our dispatch as to what this person looked like who was out of control,\\" Metz said.      Harper then allegedly ran across the street to Black's home and banged on the \\"very solid door\\" so hard that he knocked it off its hinges and entered the home, Metz said.      A number of people ran in after him in an effort to get him out of the house, but they were not able to, Metz said.      Harper allegedly dragged Black's grandson into a bathroom      After going into Black's home, Harper allegedly dragged Black's 11-year-old grandson into a bathroom and \\"violently assaulted\\" him, Metz said, declining to describe the crime further.      When Black's wife called 911, she told dispatchers that the \\"man who entered was trying to drown\\" her grandson, Metz said, adding that her 911 call was \\"incredibly difficult\\" to listen to because of all of the screaming that could be heard in the background.      Black's wife told dispatchers that a person was in the bathroom \\"hurting the child,\\" and that there \\"was lots of blood everywhere,\\" Metz said.      When the dispatcher asked Black's wife whether there were weapons, she replied, \\"No,\\" Metz said.      Another 911 from a family member of Harper's indicated that he was \\"on drugs,\\" Metz said, but it is unclear what kind of drugs the caller was referring to.      Police arrived to an \\"incredibly chaotic situation.\\"      The body camera video worn by the officer who shot Black began as he and another officer responded to the incident, Metz said.      Once they arrived and got out of the car, they encountered several people yelling in front of the home who appear \\"very agitated\\" and \\"very emotional,\\" Metz said.      The group informed the officers that they tried to get into the home and that Harper was allegedly \\"hurting the child,\\" Metz said.      As the officers walk up to the home, Black's wife can be heard saying, \\"He has a gun,\\" Metz said, but it is unclear who she is referring to.      As officers walked toward the house, they heard shots fired, \\"within 33 seconds of their arrival on scene,\\" as well as \\"a lot of screaming inside the home,\\" Metz said.      After taking a step back from the front door, the officers saw Black emerge from behind a wall about 15 to 20 feet away inside holding a gun in one hand and a flashlight in the other hand, Metz said.      For the next 13 seconds, officers gave commands to Black to drop the weapon and show his hands, but he didn't, Metz said.      Ten seconds later, Black walked toward officers with the gun and flashlight still in his hands, prompting the officer to fire four rounds at him. It is unclear how many times Black was struck.      After Black fell to the ground, the officer dispatched for medical attention and continued to give Black orders to show his hands, Metz said. He then directed other officers to provide aid to Black as he and two more officers continued \\"forward to where the screaming was coming from.\\"      While on the ground, Black was able to tell officers that his son and grandson were in the bathroom, Metz said.      KMGH      When the officers got to the bathroom, they found a \\"deceased, nude man on the floor,\\" and the 11-year-old and his father in the bathtub -- a mere 2 minutes and 27 seconds after they arrived on the scene, Metz said.      The child was screaming that Harper \\"was the one that assaulted him\\" and gave \\"pretty graphic details\\" of what happened to him, Metz said.      Once the scene was secured, Black was transported to a local hospital, where he died from his injuries, Metz said.      Authorities are not yet releasing the 911 calls or body camera footage at this time, at the request of prosecutors and Black's family, Metz said. The footage will be released at a later time, once the investigation is over and a forensic review has been conducted on the portions that are inaudible, Metz said.      \\"We are supportive of releasing it,\\" Metz said. \\"I want to make that very clear.\\"      The officer who shot Black is a veteran himself      Metz did not release the identity of the shooting officer.      The officer has been with the Aurora Police Department for three years and had just been reviewed for another police-involved shooting that took place 30 days prior, Metz said. He returned to duty 18 days after the shooting after receiving peer support and spending time with the department's psychological services, Metz said.      Metz chalked the proximity of the two shootings to coincidence and praised the way he handled the situation.      \\"We can't control the kinds of situations that our officers are going to be called to -- whether it's a week later or a year later,\\" he said. \\"I feel bad for this officer. Unfortunately, lightning struck twice for him. But, when I watched that video, I'm impressed at his ability to remain calm.\\"      Black Family      Metz disputed claims that the officers acted recklessly in their response.      \\"They were not reckless,\\" he said. \\"These officers responded, again, how I would expect them to respond in this situation, given the limited amount of information.\\"      The shooting officer, who works the graveyard shift patrolling northeast Aurora, has been placed on paid administrative leave -- as have the other officers involved, Metz said. He has had no prior internal affairs complaints, Metz said.      Black's death \\"has been devastating\\" for the officer, a military veteran himself who has served on two deployments, Metz said.      Black's family is \\"incredibly traumatized.\\"      Black \\"saved the family's life that night, in particular, his young grandson,\\" Metz said.      The grieving family is \\"incredibly traumatized,\\" Metz said.      Black received his Purple Heart and Bronze Star medals for courageous service with the U.S. Army in Vietnam, where, according to his family, he was taken prisoner and injured multiple times. After he returned from the war, Black worked as a federal employee before retiring in 2015, Metz said.      \\"My dad was a hero, period,\\" Black's stepson, Chad Hayashi, told ABC News on Wednesday. \\"He's been a hero in this country since 1966, and he needs to be recognized as such.\\"      KMGH      Metz described his meeting with Black's family on Thursday morning as \\"helpful\\" and \\"healing.\\" There, he spoke with Black's wife, who regaled stories to the police chief about how they met, how long they'd been together and \\"funny stories\\" they shared throughout their life together, Metz said.      \\"The family acknowledges that the responding officers did not receive a description\\" of the suspect, Metz said.      Black \\"deeply appreciated law enforcement,\\" Metz said.      Through local organization Cops Fighting Cancer, Black's wife would create quilts for young patients battling serious illnesses at local children's hospitals, the family's letter stated.      The police department \\"continues to remain heartbroken\\" over Black's death, he said.      Harper has an \\"extensive and violent background\\"      Harper had been arrested twice on suspicion of first-degree murder, once in 2011 and again in 2013, according to Colorado Bureau of Investigation records obtained by ABC Denver affiliate KMGH-TV. Both times the charges were either dropped or reduced, according to the CBI records.      KMGH      The families who lived in the two homes did not know each other, Metz said.      \\"It appears to be completely random,\\" he said of the encounter.      ABC News' Bill Hutchinson and Clayton Sandell contributed to this report. ||||| Aurora police officers ordered the man they fatally shot while protecting his home early Monday to drop his gun multiple times, but they did not identify themselves as police before an officer fired four shots, Chief Nick Metz said.      Multiple officers already had heard gunshots from inside the home at 10609 E. Montview Blvd. and were standing near the front door’s threshold, looking into the well-lit home when they saw homeowner Gary Black come around a corner holding a gun and a flashlight, Metz said.      “For the next 13 seconds, officers continued to give at least five commands to Mr. Black to drop the gun and to show his hands,” Metz said Thursday at a news conference. “We don’t know why, but for whatever reason Mr. Black did not drop the gun.”      Black had significant hearing impairment because of his military service, Metz said. Also, the scene was noisy from people screaming, including Black’s 11-year-old grandson, who had been violently attacked by a naked intruder.      For the first time since the early Monday morning shooting, Metz addressed the media about what happened in the early morning hours when a naked stranger burst through the front door of the Black family home and began attacking the grandson sleeping on the couch. Black, a decorated Vietnam veteran and retired federal government employee, grabbed his 9mm pistol and killed the intruder, 26-year-old Dajon Harper.      Metz defended the actions of his officers, including the one who fired the fatal shots, and said tears had been shed at the Aurora Police Department over the tragedy. He said threats had been made against Aurora police officers in connection with the shooting.      “There was a reference that our officers acted recklessly,” Metz said. “I dispute that strongly. They were not reckless. They responded how I would expect them to respond given the limited amount of information they were given.”      Metz also hailed Black as a hero for defending his family.      “There’s no doubt in my mind in any shape or form that Mr. Black saved his family’s life that night,” Metz said.      Metz played audio between officers and a dispatcher and released five 911 calls from nearby residents and people attending a party where Harper had been. But he will not released the body camera footage from officers at the request of the 17th Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which is conducting the ongoing criminal investigation into the police shooting, and because the Black family has asked that it be withheld.      In a statement, the family said, “The family desires space to grieve and does not wish to have the final and violent moments of Gary’s distinguished life be his public legacy.”      Metz insisted officers were not given a physical description of the suspect, but he also admitted that large portions of the 911 calls and body camera videos are inaudible because of screaming and yelling.      Earlier this week, attorneys representing the Black family said Jeanette Black, the wife, had told 911 operators and officer on the scene that her husband was white and wearing a bathrobe.      But Metz said that cannot be heard on the 911 audio or body camera videos. Metz promised to hire forensic audio experts to try to interpret the garbled sounds.      When Jeanette Black called 911, an operator asked whether anyone had weapons, Metz said.      “The caller asks somebody else, ‘Are there weapons?’ and the answer came back as no,” Metz said.      There was no physical description of the suspect. The caller said the person was in the bathroom and hurting the child. The caller said there was lots of blood everywhere, Metz said.      When officers arrived on scene, however, Jeanette Black said, “He has a gun,” according to Metz, who has listened to the audio from police radio and watched the body camera footage.      Metz said he allowed the Black family to watch the videos and listen to the audio recordings on Thursday.      The Black family said in its statement, “The 911 telephone call by Mrs. Black was difficult to understand as large portions are unintelligible. The family acknowledges the APD’s position that the responding officers did not receive a description of the intruders.”      Police first responded to the neighborhood around 1:30 a.m. after multiple people called from a party at a home on the corner of Iola Street and Montview Boulevard.      One caller, who identified herself as the intruder’s mother, told police that her son was on drugs, had kicked in a neighbor’s door and was drowning a baby. Several times, she quit talking to the operator and could be heard screaming at her son and others in the house.      “My son is on something,” she said.      Toward the end of the call the woman suddenly yelled, “They killed my son. They killed him.” There was loud wailing and then the call ended.      Another caller told 911 that people were fighting and she could hear someone breaking glass. But other callers hung up without providing information about their location or what was happening.      “I cannot talk on the phone. Just please get here. Hurry,” one caller said and then hung up.      Harper, for unknown reasons, ran to the Black home and began pounding on the door. He knocked the door off its hinges and went inside. He grabbed the 11-year-old boy sleeping on the couch and took him into a bathroom where he began choking and attempting to drown the child, Metz said.      “I won’t go into the graphic details other than to say the child was violently assaulted,” he said.      Multiple people from the party had followed Harper into the house to try to stop him, Metz said. That contributed to the chaos for the officers and the Black family, he said.      After officers heard the gunshots, they saw Black walk around a corner and then turn back. He came toward them again as they ordered him to drop the gun. Black raised his flashlight toward them before the one officer fired, Metz said.      “It was that time my officer fired four rounds, causing Mr. Black to fall to the ground,” Metz said.      The chief refused to speculate as to why other officers decided to hold their fire, and he did not give details as to where each officer was standing as Black approached.      “I wanted to give you a picture of what was going in that house. It was a very chaotic situation. A very violent situation,” Metz said.      Metz confirmed that the officer who fatally shot Black was the same one involved in a fatal shooting in late June. Metz said the officer, who has not been identified but is a three-year department veteran, went through all the requirements necessary to come back after a shooting, including peer support, psychiatric services and gun range training. He spent 15 days on leave before being declared fit for duty.      “I believe this officer was ready to go back,” Metz said.      Because of the officer is under investigation for two shootings, Metz said he asked the 18th and 17th judicial district attorney’s offices to expedite their investigations. The 18th Judicial District is investigating the June 27 shooting outside an East Colfax Avenue motel.      Jess Redman, assistant district attorney for the 17th Judicial District, said he wanted to uphold the integrity of the investigation and had asked that body camera footage and Jeanette Black’s 911 call be withheld.      “I’m committed to the victims of crime and in this scenario that’s the Black family and the Harper family,” Redman said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Aurora Police Chief Nick Metz reported that Richard \\"Gary\\" Black, a 73-year-old homeowner, saved his grandson and protected his family from an intruder before being shot by an officer. Metz highlighted that the department will not release body-worn camera video or the 911 audio recording of the incident as the district attorney's office has requested that the release of the video be withheld, and the family also requested that the body-cam video and the 911 call recordings not be released at this time. The suspect in the home invasion, 26-year-old Dajon Harper, had become out of control and started damaging cars in the neighborhood before invading Black's home, grabbing his 11-year-old grandchild, and violently assaulting him. Metz stated that the police officer who fatally shot Black had been with the department for three years and is a military veteran himself.

The games I tried to play were laggy, unresponsive, and completely unenjoyable. It was practically impossible to play any games because of how poor the performance was.  The interface is also far from user-friendly, making it incredibly difficult to navigate and manage the settings. It was frustrating just trying to get a game to load, let alone play it. Moreover, the ads were intrusive and excessive, interrupting the gameplay constantly and making the experience exponentially worse.

Let's add 105 to both sides of the equation (to make it fair): 0 + 105 = -7*j - 105 + 105 This simplifies to: 105 = -7*j Now we need to get rid of the -7. Since it's multiplied by \\"j\\", we'll do the opposite and divide by -7 to both sides: 105 ÷ -7 = (-7*j) ÷ -7 This simplifies to: -15 = j And there we go!

I heard that Lee talked to their boss about how they can progress better.  And I was wondering What will happen to Lee? Select from the following. - be admired by fellow workers; - look like a bad person; - laughed at by workers;","output":"It's not possible to predict the exact outcome of Lee talking to their boss about their progress since it depends on various factors, such as the company culture, the relationship between Lee and the boss, the co-workers' attitudes, and how the conversation was communicated. However, I can elaborate on possible scenarios based on the given options: 1. Be admired by fellow workers: If Lee approached their boss with a professional attitude, a clear plan, and a willingness to grow, their co-workers may perceive this positively. They might admire Lee's initiative, drive, and commitment to self-improvement. This could result in increased respect and better relationships with colleagues. 2. Look like a bad person: In some situations where office politics or toxic work culture prevails, openly discussing progress with the boss might be seen as an attempt to curry favor or undermine others. In such cases, discussing personal growth objectives with the boss could be perceived negatively by co-workers, who might see Lee as a threat or someone trying to manipulate the situation for their own benefit. 3. Laughed at by workers: If the conversation between Lee and the boss were to become public knowledge or if Lee approached the discussion in an inappropriate or comical way, co-workers might perceive it as a humorous or ridiculous situation. In this case, Lee might not be taken seriously or could be the subject of office gossip and jokes. It's essential to consider the overall work environment and the specific individuals involved to more accurately predict the outcome for Lee.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When US student Olivia Priedeman, 17, woke up one morning, she thought she had had a dream about making plans with a friend. But it wasn't a dream. Her phone showed that during the night, Priedeman had read a text message from her friend. She did it while she was fast asleep. Reading and sending text messages while asleep--called \\"sleep texting\\"--is an unusual sleep behaviour, similar to sleepwalking. It's also a growing concern  among doctors: young people can't live without their cell phones. One in three teenagers sends more than 100 text messages a day, according to the Pew Internet & American Life Project. And at least four out of five teenagers said they sleep with their phone on or near their bed. Elizabeth Dowdell, a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, has studied sleeping texting. She said that having a phone nearby all night is a big part of the problem. Andrew Stiehm, a sleep medicine expert with Allina Health in Minnesota, agrees. It's possible for the part of the brain that controls motor skills   to wake up, while the part of the brain that controls memory and judgment  may be still asleep. That's why some people can perform basic movements ---such as walking, talking, texting or even driving--while they're sleeping. Some of Dowdell's students said that they're disturbed by their nighttime texting behavior. But because sleep texting is _ , it's a difficult habit to break. Dowdell said she knows of some students who wear socks on their hands to keep themselves from texting. Marjorie Hogan, a doctor at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, suggests keeping all electronic devices  outside the bedroom at certain times. Question: What does doctor Hogan suggest people who sleep text do? Answer: Pick from:  (A). Stop text during the daytime.  (B). Take some medicine to control the behaviour.  (C).

Some important elements of traditional Islam, such as the five salat prayers, are mentioned in hadith.  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims.

Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.  - South Asia or Southern Asia is a term used to represent the southern region of the Asian continent, which comprises the sub-Himalayan SAARC countries and, for some authorities, adjoining countries to the west and east. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.  - Shia (\\"Shah\\", from \\"Shatu Al\\", followers of Ali) is a branch of Islam which holds that the Islamic prophet Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor (Imam). Shia Islam primarily contrasts with Sunni Islam, whose adherents believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor.

The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.  - The Yazidis (also Yezidis, \\"Êzidî\\") are an ethnically Kurdish religious community or an ethno-religious group indigenous to northern Mesopotamia (see also Ezidkhan) who are strictly endogamous. Their religion, \\"Yazidism\\" is linked to ancient Mesopotamian religions and combines aspects of Zoroastrianism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish). The Soviet Union considered the Yazidis to be Kurds, as does Sharaf Khan Bidlisi's \\"Sheref-nameh\\" of 1597, which cites seven of the Kurdish tribes as being at least partly Yazidi, and Kurdish tribal confederations as containing substantial Yazidi sections.   - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia.

It is contrasted with \\"taqlid\\" (imitation, conformity to legal precedent). According to classical Sunni theory, \\"ijtihad\\" requires expertise in the Arabic language, theology, revealed texts, and principles of jurisprudence (\\"usul al-fiqh\\"),  and is not employed where authentic and authoritative texts (Qur'an and ahadith) are considered unambiguous with regard to the question, or where there is an existing scholarly consensus (\\"ijma\\"). Ijtihad is considered to be a religious duty for those qualified to perform it. An Islamic scholar who is qualified to perform \\"ijtihad\\" is called a \\"mujtahid\\".  - Ayatollah Allama Hussain Bakhsh Jarra was a prominent Shia scholar from Punjab , Pakistan .

PUBLISHED:. 08:29 EST, 26 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 19:06 EST, 26 November 2012. A benefits cheat caught hula dancing on holiday after claiming to be wheelchair bound must pay more than £300,000 or face a longer prison sentence. Abdul Esfandmozd, 52, will have  at least five years added to his four-year sentence if he does not pay  the money. He claimed to be disabled for ten years, pocketing nearly £100,000 in benefits, but was caught out when council  officers noticed fake names on records he was meant to keep of money he  spent on carers. 'Living a lie': Abdul Esfandmozd, 52, pocketed public money meant for carers and spent it on exotic holiday and building a property empire. Scam: A raid on his home uncovered pictures of him on holiday hula dancing, diving into a pool and lifting a woman up, as well as home videos of him walking long distances. In August, Esfandmozd was found guilty of fraud, obtaining money by deception and entering into a money laundering arrangement. He had to reappear before Portsmouth Crown Court to hear a judge’s verdict on how the money  he made with his scam should be recouped. Despite being exposed as a cheat, Esfandmozd still insisted on using his wheelchair to attend the hearing. Judge Sarah Munro QC  ruled that his total gain  through crime was £318,593.21 and gave him nine months to pay up. She repeatedly had to ask him to be quiet as he shouted ‘I still trust British justice’ from the back of the court. The sum includes £140,000 from the Department for Work and Pensions that he was not prosecuted for and the profits for two properties that he bought with his ill-gotten money. Out for a stroll: He was found guilty of two counts of fraud, two of obtaining money by deception and three of entering into a money laundering arrangement. Whale of a time: Despite being outed as a liar, Esfandmozd still insisted on using his wheelchair to attend the hearing at Portsmouth Crown Court. Michael Lawther, solicitor  for Portsmouth City Council, said: ‘Esfandmozd stole a  substantial amount of money from taxpayers. We’re pleased we’ll be able to recover it.’ A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said that Esfandmozd’s property could be seized to pay the order. Between 2000 and 2010, Esfandmozd claimed £93,730  in disability payments from  the council. He said he was incapable of standing or walking without crutches and used an electric wheelchair to get around. He was supposed to spend the money on carers and neighbours were fooled by his supposedly modest lifestyle. But instead he took regular holidays to America, Cyprus and Malta and invested in property. The scam came to light  when council officers noticed paperwork for the care work he was supposed to be buying was not in order. Good times: Neighbours were fooled by his supposedly modest lifestyle, but meanwhile the conman was enjoying a luxury lifestyle. Forms on which he was meant to list carers’ names included former England goalkeeper P Shilton, athlete D Thompson and even a Mr D Duck. A raid of his flat in Somers Town, Hampshire, uncovered home videos of him on holiday,  dancing, swimming and even lifting a woman up. There were also six hours of home videos of him filmed on holiday in which he was shown walking long distances. Sentencing him, Judge Munro said: ‘You are in my view  one of the most dishonest  and manipulative individuals ever to have come before  this court.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Abdul Esfandmozd, a 52-year-old benefits cheat, was caught hula dancing on holiday despite claiming to be wheelchair-bound for ten years.

The classical Hellenes emerged as an amalgam of these six peoples. The distinction between the Leleges and the Carians (a nation living in south west Anatolia) is unclear. According to Homer, the Leleges were a distinct Anatolian tribe; However, Herodotus states that \\"Leleges\\" had been an early name for the Carians. The fourth-century BCE historian Philippus of Theangela, suggested that the Leleges maintained connections to Messenia, Laconia, Locris and other regions in mainland Greece, after they were overcome by the Carians in Asia Minor.  - A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state. In federations, \\"governor\\" may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal and largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government.  - Mausolus was a ruler of Caria (377353 BC), nominally the Persian Satrap, who enjoyed the status of king or dynast by virtue of the powerful position created by his father Hecatomnus who had succeeded the assassinated Persian Satrap Tissaphernes in the Carian satrapy and founded the hereditary dynasty of the Hecatomnids.  - Ada of Caria ( Ancient Greek :  ) ( fl . 377 -- 326 BC ) was a member of the House of Hecatomnus ( the Hecatomnids ) and ruler of Caria in the 4th century BC , first as Persian Satrap and later as Queen under the auspices of Alexander III ( the Great ) of Macedon . Ada was the daughter of Hecatomnus , satrap of Caria , and sister of Mausolus , Artemisia , Idrieus , and Pixodarus . She was married to her brother Idrieus , who succeeded Artemisia in 351 BC and died in 344 BC. On the death of her husband Ada became satrap of Caria , but was expelled by her brother Pixodarus in 340 BC. Ada fled to the fortress of Alinda , where she maintained her rule in exile . When Alexander the Great entered Caria in 334 BC , Ada adopted Alexander as her son and surrendered Alinda to him . In return , Alexander accepted the offer and gave Ada formal command of the Siege of Halicarnassus . After the fall of Halicarnassus , Alexander returned Alinda and made Ada queen of the whole of Caria . Ada 's popularity with the populace in turn ensured the Carians ' loyalty to Alexander . According to Turkish archaeologists , the tomb of Ada has been discovered , although this claim remains unresolved . Her remains are on display in the archaeological museum of Bodrum .  - The Hecatomnid dynasty or Hecatomnids were the rulers of Caria and surrounding areas from about 395334 BCE. They were nominally satraps (governors) under the Persian Achaeminid Empire, but ruled with considerable autonomy, and established a hereditary dynasty. The dynasty was founded by Hecatomnus and originally had its seat in Mylasa; Mausolus moved it to Halicarnassus.  - Satraps (Old Persian: xšarapwn) were the governors of the provinces of the ancient Median and Achaemenid (Persian) Empires and in several of their successors, such as the Sasanian Empire and the Hellenistic empires.  - Mycale. also Mykale and Mykali, called Samsun Da and Dilek Da (Dilek Peninsula) in modern Turkey, is a mountain on the west coast of central Anatolia in Turkey, north of the mouth of the Maeander and divided from the Greek island of Samos by the 1.6 km wide Mycale Strait. The mountain forms a ridge, terminating in what was known anciently as the Trogilium promontory (Ancient Greek  or ). There are several beaches on the north shore ranging from sand to pebbles. The south flank is mainly escarpment.  - A province is almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman \\"provincia\\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.  - The Old Persian language is one of the two directly attested Old Iranian languages (the other being Avestan). Old Persian appears primarily in the inscriptions, clay tablets, and seals of the Achaemenid era (c. 600 BCE to 300 BCE). Examples of Old Persian have been found in what is now present-day Iran, Romania (Gherla), Armenia, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt, the most important attestation by far being the contents of the Behistun Inscription (dated to 525 BCE). Recent research into the vast Persepolis Fortification Archive at the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago have unearthed Old Persian tablets (2007). This new text shows that the Old Persian language was a written language in use for practical recording and not only for royal display.  - The Sasanian Empire (or ), also known as Sassanian, Sasanid, Sassanid or Neo-Persian Empire), known to its inhabitants as rnshahr in Middle Persian, was the last imperial dynasty in Persia (Iran) before the rise of Islam, ruled by and named after the Sasanian dynasty from 224 to 651 AD. The Sasanian Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognized as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighboring arch-rival the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years.  - Caria (from Luwian: \\"Karuwa\\", \\"steep country\\"; Ancient Greek: , \\"Karia\\") was a region of western Anatolia extending along the coast from mid-Ionia (Mycale) south to Lycia and east to Phrygia. The Ionian and Dorian Greeks colonized the west of it and joined the Carian population in forming Greek-dominated states there. The inhabitants of Caria, known as Carians, had arrived there before the Greeks. They were described by Herodotos as being of Minoan descent, while the Carians themselves maintained that they were Anatolian mainlanders intensely engaged in seafaring and were akin to the Mysians and the Lydians. The Carians did speak an Anatolian language, known as Carian, which does not necessarily reflect their geographic origin, as Anatolian once may have been widespread. Also closely associated with the Carians were the Leleges, which could be an earlier name for Carians or for a people who had preceded them in the region and continued to exist as part of their society in a reputedly second-class status.  - Hecatomnus of Mylasa or Hekatomnos was an early 4th-century BC ruler of Caria. He was the satrap (governor) of Caria for the Persian Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II (404358 BC). However, the basis for Hecatomnus' political power was twofold: he was both a high appointed Persian official and a powerful local dynast, who founded the hereditary dynasty of the Hecatomnids.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A diary is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, and/or thoughts or feelings, including comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist.

Překlad do češtiny: V češtině se \\"I am a liar.\\" překládá jako \\"Jsem lhář.\\" Tato věta je jednoduchá slovní spojení, které se skládá ze tří částí: podmět (I - já), sloveso (am - jsem) a přívlastek (a liar - lhář). Jde o prostou větu oznamovací, která popisuje identitu mluvčího nebo psavce jako lháře.  Český jazyk patří do skupiny západoslovanských jazyků a jeho struktura se může lišit od angličtiny, která patří do skupiny germánských jazyků. Hlavní gramatické rozdíly mezi angličtinou a češtinou zahrnují: 1. Český jazyk má sedm pádů, zatímco angličtina má pouze tři (nominativ, genitiv a akuzativ). Pády jsou gramatické kategorie, které ovlivňují tvar substantiv, adjektiv a zájmen, aby vyjádřily vztah mezi slovy ve větě. 2. Slovosled v češtině je volnější než v angličtině, protože většina gramatických informací je již zakódována do tvaru slov. To znamená, že česky můžete říci \\"Jsem lhář.\\", \\"Lhář jsem.\\" nebo \\"Já jsem lhář.\\" a všechna tato spojení budou mít stejný význam. 3. V češtině se používají ohyby, které slouží k označení gramatických funkcí slov ve větě. Naopak, angličtina používá více předložek a pomocných slov. S ohledem na tyto gramatické rozdíly je důležité při překladu mezi češtinou a angličtinou respektovat specifika obou jazyků. Při překládání věty \\"I am a liar.\\" do češtiny je nutné nejdříve zaměřit se na podmět \\"I\\" (já), poté sloveso \\"am\\" (jsem) a nakonec přívlastek \\"a liar\\" (lhář).

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"From the given sentence, \\"Trance music has its origins in House music,\\" we can extract several pieces of information, which can be categorized and analyzed in different ways. 1. Genres of Music: The sentence introduces two distinct genres of music, namely Trance music and House music. These are subgenres of Electronic Dance Music (EDM), characterized by different musical elements, instruments, and structures. 2. Origin and Development: The sentence establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between the two genres by stating that Trance music has its origins in House music. This implies that Trance music evolved from or was influenced by House music, either through blending with other musical styles or through its experimentation and innovation. 3. Timeline: Although no specific dates or time periods are mentioned in the sentence, we can infer that House music pre-dates Trance music. Since House music originated in the early 1980s, we can deduce that Trance music development began sometime after that. 4. Cultural and Geographical Context: The sentence does not explicitly mention the geographical roots of these genres, but we can deduce some context from the mention of the genres themselves. House music originated in the United States, specifically in Chicago, while Trance music is believed to have originated in Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This information can lead to further exploration into regional differences and influences on the development of these musical styles. 5. Elements and Characteristics: The sentence, though brief, allows us to delve deeper into the musical characteristics of both Trance and House music. For example, we might explore the specific elements, structures, and features that Trance music borrowed or adapted from House music, such as tempo, rhythm patterns, synthesizers, drum machines, and melodies. 6. Musical Evolution: The statement suggests that the development of Trance music is not an isolated phenomenon but rather part of the larger evolution of EDM. This may lead to a discussion on how genres within EDM might have influenced each other over time, including their characteristics and notable artists, producers, and events in the respective genres. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Trance music has its origins in House music\\" provides valuable information about the relationship between two genres of music, their origin, development, and context. It encourages further exploration of the specific musical elements of these genres, their evolution within the broader scope of EDM, and the influences of various cultural and geographical factors on their development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since 2001, the band's line-up has included vocalist and rhythm guitarist Duff McKagan (Velvet Revolver and Guns N' Roses), lead guitarist Mike Squires (formerly of Nevada Bachelors and Alien Crime Syndicate) and bassist Jeff Rouse (formerly of Alien Crime Syndicate, Sirens Sister, and Vendetta Red). Since 2009, Isaac Carpenter (formerly of Loudermilk, Gosling, and The Exies) has been the band's drummer, replacing Geoff Reading (formerly of New American Shame and Green Apple Quick Step). McKagan first formed Loaded to be his touring band in support of his unreleased solo album Beautiful Disease. Duff McKagan was previously a member of Guns N' Roses from the mid-1980s to late 1990s. Guns N' Roses achieved international success, going on to sell over 100 million albums worldwide, but the strain between singer Axl Rose and the rest of the band led to a number of members leaving or being fired, with McKagan departing in 1997.  McKagan moved back to Seattle, reforming previous group 10 Minute Warning, releasing one self-titled album on Sub Pop in 1998, before recording his second solo album Beautiful Disease the same year. Featuring collaborations with former Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin, former Black Flag singer Dez Cadena and his former Guns N' Roses band mates Slash and Izzy Stradlin, Beautiful Disease was scheduled to be released through Geffen in 1999. McKagan formed Loaded, initially as The Gentlemen, to be his band for the tour supporting the album. With McKagan performing lead vocals and bass duties, Loaded's line-up consisted of guitarists Dez Cadena and Michael Barragan as well as drummer Taz Bentley.  McKagan began promoting the album; however, following the merger between Geffen and Interscope Records, he was dropped from the label and lost all commercial rights to release the record with only a few promo copies being leaked. Loaded continued to tour and released a live album, Episode 1999: Live, independently, which was recorded and mixed by Nick Raskulinecz. They re-recorded half of Beautiful Disease and received offers from four labels. However, they disbanded before the end of the year, with McKagan and Bentley becoming part of Izzy Stradlin's rhythm section for his tour of Japan supporting Ride On.

Please answer the following question: Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which came first, University of Cologne or monastic schools? Context: European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries. Answer:","output":"Monastic schools came first. In the given context, it is mentioned that European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), with evidence dating back to the 6th century.

The output should be the list of prime numbers in the input list. If there are no primes in the input list an empty list (\\"[]\\") should be returned. [801, 55, 3, 768, 197, 677, 103, 739, 89, 849, 769]","output":"To come up with the answer, we first need to identify the prime numbers from the given list of integers. We do this by iterating through each integer in the input list and checking if it is prime. We can check if a number is prime by dividing it by all smaller positive integers greater than 1. If the integer is divisible by any of these smaller integers, it is not prime. To optimize this process, we can stop checking when the smaller integer is greater than the square root of the number being tested. In this case, we have the input list: [801, 55, 3, 768, 197, 677, 103, 739, 89, 849, 769] We iterate through each integer and check if it is prime: 801 - Not prime (divisible by 3) 55 - Not prime (divisible by 5) 3 - Prime 768 - Not prime (divisible by 2) 197 - Prime 677 - Prime 103 - Prime 739 - Prime 89 - Prime 849 - Not prime (divisible by 3) 769 - Not prime (divisible by 769) After identifying the prime numbers, we can create a new list containing only the prime numbers. So the final list of prime numbers is: [3, 197, 677, 103, 739, 89] Thus, the answer is [3, 197, 677, 103, 739, 89]."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

UPDATED:. 19:29 EST, 24 September 2013. For many mothers-to-be and bashful husbands, they have been a ritual of pregnancy for decades and regarded as a source of invaluable skills. But the digital age and pressure of time is consigning antenatal classes to online tutorials. A drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to a decision to phase them out but critics are disappointed that the classes are being 'abandoned'. Parenting charity NCT said the move online will put parents at a disadvantage but York Hospital insists the virtual classes will allow expectant mothers to access important information. A hospital is to become the first in the country to replace antenatal lessons. with 'virtual classes' to be watched online. A drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to the decision. All of the same information will be available online with virtual classes filmed at the maternity suite at York Hospital showing its staff and labour rooms. The filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing, the early stages of labour, and explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief as well as breast feeding and what can be expected after birth. Midwife Sue Jackson said the films will familiarise the majority of women who are not going to classes with the staff and facilities. She said: 'It should open up the information available to women much more effectively than what we have at the moment. We have to make sure the service is appropriate and is being accessed appropriately.' York Hospital said antenatal classes will still be held for teenage mothers and women giving birth to more than one baby. The filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing and the early stages of labour. They will also include an explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief, breast feeding and what can be expected after the birth. Women will continue to see a midwife who will answer any questions and give guidance. But the parenting charity NCT has said it is disappointed antenatal classes were being 'abandoned altogether'. Belinda Phipps, chief executive, said: 'There is currently no evidence to show that online courses are as good as traditional antenatal courses. 'Replacing the courses with an online-only system could put parents at a disadvantage. 'Antenatal education is not just about the transfer of information, but also the support you get from the parents that you meet.' York Hospital said other relevant information to mums will also be available on the site, including information about healthy eating and frequently asked questions.","output":"This article talks about how some hospitals are changing the way they teach parents-to-be about having a baby.

In these online classes, people can learn about things like relaxing, what happens during labor, and how to take care of a baby after it's born.

I eat a snack before getting up, and then I quickly pack my sleeping bag, tent, and other things and get on the road. Usually I have less speed. Traveling by bike allows me to stop anywhere, such as lakes(especially places to swim), woods, and scenic spots . Somewhere near lunch, I find a small drugstore and buy some bread, sandwich materials, and fruit. In the afternoon, my speeds are higher, and I spend less time at stops. In the late afternoon, I start thinking about stopping. I finally find a place in the early evening, cook a simple meal, and rest and cool off. As it starts to get dark, I put up my tent, and fall asleep. There are exciting times and difficult times as well. Visiting strange or famous places are always exciting to me. I meet and talk with interesting people along the way. Enjoying beautiful scenes, meeting wild animals(usually at my camping site), and traveling up and down hills also make me cheerful.

She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans, who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at château d'Eu in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848, and fled to exile in England. At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House, a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped.

Option (i): Angle the toothbrush upwards when brushing, that way you'll clean under your gums. 1. Angling the toothbrush upwards allows for better reach and cleaning around the gum line. 2. By angling upwards, the bristles are able to go deeper between the teeth and effectively remove any trapped food or debris. Option (ii): Angle the toothbrush in front of your lips when brushing, that way you'll clean under your gums. 1. Angling the toothbrush in front of the lips does not provide an efficient angle for cleaning under the gums. 2. This position would focus mainly on the visible surfaces of the teeth and may not clean the gum line or in-between the teeth properly. Justification: After analyzing both options, it is clear that Option (i) is a better solution to achieve the goal of brushing teeth effectively since it focuses on cleaning under the gums, around the gum line, and in-between the teeth. Option (ii) seems to only focus on the visible surfaces of the teeth and may not provide an efficient clean for the gum line or in between the teeth.

A:","output":"No, \\"needed to get lost\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\" due to the following reasons. 1.

Based on the premise \\"If this recommendation is too narrowly defined, we will encourage people to look at small things like training programs.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"People need to train \\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, it may not be conclusively appropriate to directly assert that the hypothesis \\"People need to train\\" is true. However, there is an implicit association between the premise and the hypothesis. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of this connection, it is essential to break down the various components, consider different perspectives, and analyze the potential implications of the premise. The premise states, \\"If this recommendation is too narrowly defined, we will encourage people to look at small things like training programs.\\" The first aspect to consider is the meaning of 'too narrowly defined.' This expression implies that the recommendation at hand may restrict its focus to a limited set of variables or aspects, thereby inadvertently excluding other relevant considerations. Consequently, individuals seeking guidance might be motivated to explore more narrowly scoped matters, such as specific training programs, which could contribute to their growth and development. By mentioning training programs, the premise acknowledges the role of training in personal and professional development. Thus, the hypothesis \\"People need to train\\" does bear relevance in this context, as it aligns with the idea that individuals should engage in activities that enhance their skills and capabilities. However, the premise's primary concern lies with the consequences of a too narrowly defined recommendation. The suggestion is that such a recommendation may lead people to focus primarily on small things like training, potentially resulting in overlooking other important aspects that contribute to development. This consequence underscores the need for a more comprehensive and holistic approach to providing recommendations to people. The hypothesis \\"People need to train\\" is not explicitly supported by the premise, but it does resonate with the underlying sentiment. Training can indeed be beneficial, but if people exclusively concentrate on it as a result of a narrowly defined recommendation, they might miss other crucial factors that contribute to their overall growth. These other factors might include mentorship, networking, work-life balance, mental and physical wellness, and continued education, among others. In conclusion, while the hypothesis \\"People need to train\\" is not directly proven by the premise, it is implicitly associated with the understanding that training can be an essential component of self-improvement. The premise mainly highlights the potential pitfalls of an overly narrow recommendation, which might lead individuals to focus on small things to their developmental detriment. A more balanced and comprehensive perspective is necessary to ensure a well-rounded approach to growth and development, which may indeed include training as one of the critical elements."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Rescue workers attempt to find survivors from the rubble of the collapsed Rana Plaza building in Savar, around 30 km (19 miles) outside Dhaka May 4, 2013.      DHAKA Bangladeshi salvage workers on Monday neared the end of their search for victims of the collapse of a factory building, scouring the basement of the complex that crumbled in on itself and killed 1,127 people.      A series of deadly incidents at factories, including a fire in November that killed 112 people, has focused global attention on safety standards in Bangladesh's booming garment industry.      The toll of 1,127 - the world's most deadly industrial accident since 1984 Bhopal disaster in India - could be the final one as no more bodies were found on Monday, a spokesman at the army control room coordinating the salvage operation said.      \\"The rescuers have reached the basement where the chances of finding more dead bodies are very low,\\" said Captain Tazul Islam.      The site will be handed over to the district administration on Tuesday on completion of salvage work, according to army spokesman Shahinul Islam.      Reshma Begum, 19, a Bangladeshi woman who spent 17 days buried alive under factory rubble until her dramatic rescue on Friday, made her first public appearance on Monday and said she drew on mental fortitude to survive.      \\"After ... much time I regained my senses and heard several voices (of other victims) around me who cried out and said please give me water ... I replied where shall I get water? I could not see anything as it was dark everywhere,\\" Begum said.      She said she eventually managed to find a packet of biscuits which she ate as well as two bottles of water that helped slake her terrible thirst. \\"After that there was nothing to eat.\\"      She said she could hear many other victims weeping under the wreckage. \\"But I did not fear. I don't know where I got so much mental strength. I never thought that I could survive. It is the almighty Allah who saved me,\\" said Begum, who doctors said has been recovering from acute dehydration.      The cabinet approved an amendment to Bangladesh's labor laws on Monday, paving the way for parliament to allow garment workers to form unions without prior employer approval to help improve their job conditions, especially safety standards.      International labor and human rights groups had long campaigned for workers to be able to form establish unions without such approval. The amendment was endorsed a day after the government decided to form a wage board to consider pay increases for readymade garment workers.      Average monthly minimum wages now stand at the equivalent of 38 after an increase of about 80 percent in 2010 in response to months of violent street protests.      UNREST TRIGGERS FACTORY CLOSURES      Worker unrest prompted authorities to shut down more than 300 garment factories for indefinite periods in the Ashulia industrial belt, on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, that accounts for nearly 20 percent of total exports.      \\"Owners decided to close their factories on safety grounds after workers went on a rampage almost every day after the collapse of Rana Plaza,\\" said Mohammad Atiqul Islam, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.      Eight people were killed in a fire at a factory last week that an industry association said may have been arson.      About 2,500 people were rescued from the Rana Plaza, in Savar, a commercial suburb of Dhaka, after the April 24 collapse. Many survivors suffered serious injuries.      The disaster, believed to have been triggered when generators were started up during a blackout, has raised questions about the use by Western retailers of the impoverished South Asian nation as a source of cheap goods.      Nine people have been arrested in connection with the disaster, including the building's owner and bosses of the factories it housed.      The government has accused the owners and builders of the eight-storey complex of using shoddy building materials, including substandard rods, bricks and cement, and of not obtaining the necessary clearances.      Bangladesh's garment industry accounts for 80 percent of its exports. Low wages have helped lift Bangladesh to number two in the global ranking of exporters, behind China.      Bangladesh ranked last in minimum wages for factory workers in 2010, according to World Bank data, behind Cambodia.      (Editing by Mark Heinrich) ||||| Three weeks after a building collapse in Bangladesh that killed more than 1,100 workers, several of the world’s largest apparel companies – including the retailing giant H&M and Inditex, owner of the Zara chain — agreed on Monday to sign a far-reaching and legally binding plan that requires retailers to help finance fire safety and building improvements in the factories they use in Bangladesh.      Consumer and labor groups hailed the move by Sweden-based H&M – which is the largest purchaser of garments from Bangladesh – as an important step toward improving factory safety in Bangladesh, saying it would increase pressure on other Western retailers and apparel brands to do likewise.      Within hours of H&M's Monday statement, C&A of the Netherlands and two British retailers, Primark and Tesco, also joined in.      The factory safety agreement calls for independent, rigorous factory safety inspections with public reports and mandatory repairs and renovations underwritten by Western retailers. A legally enforceable contract, it also calls for retailers to stop doing business with any factory that refuses to make necessary safety improvements, and for workers and their unions to have a substantial voice in factory safety. ||||| Hundreds of factories which form the hub of Bangladesh's garment industry are to close indefinitely after worker unrest sparked by the death of more than 1,100 colleagues, employees announced Monday.      As the search for bodies from last month's collapse of a factory complex wrapped up, the textile industry's main trade body said all operations at the nearby Ashulia industrial zone were being suspended until further notice.      Shahidullah Azim, of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said the decision to shut down all the factories at Ashulia, on the outskirts of Dhaka, was made \\"to ensure the security of our factories\\".      Local police chief Badrul Alam told AFP that workers in 80 percent of the factories had walked out earlier in the day to demand an increase in salaries as well as the execution of the owner of the collapsed Rana Plaza complex in the town of Savar.      Most of Bangladesh's top garment factories are based at Ashulia and there has been \\"virtually no work\\" there since the April 24 Rana Plaza tragedy, Azim said.      Tensions in Ashulia had been further inflamed by the discovery of a dead female garment worker on Sunday. Police said they suspect that the death was a suicide sparked by a \\"love affair\\".      Ashulia is home to around 500 factories which make clothing for a string of major Western retailers including Walmart, H&M, Tesco and Carrefour.      News of the indefinite closure represents yet another body blow to the industry which has pleaded with Western retailers not to pull out of Bangladesh and promised to come up with a credible safety framework.      The collapse of the nine-storey Rana Plaza, which housed five separate garment factories, was the worst industrial disaster in Bangladeshi history and the latest in a long line of deadly tragedies to blight the textile industry.      A fire at a garment factory in Dhaka last November killed 111 workers and a blaze at another plant killed eight people last week.      Bangladesh's army announced Monday that it was wrapping up its search for bodies at Savar, saying it now believed a total of 1,127 people were killed.      The army general in charge of the marathon recovery effort said that he was now handing over operational control to civilian administrators and expected his troops to be back in their barracks by Tuesday afternoon.      \\"The army's recovery operation is almost over,\\" Brigadier General Siddiqul Alam told AFP.      \\"We're in the process of handing over the site to the district administration and we'll leave for our cantonment by 2:00pm tomorrow.      \\"We don't think there are any more bodies in the rubble.\\"      Many of the three million employed in the industry earn a basic 40 dollars a month, a wage condemned as \\"slave labour\\" by Pope Francis.      Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi micro-loan pioneer who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, on Monday urged manufacturers and Western retailers to ensure that garment workers are paid a living wage.      \\"We don't want to make Bangladesh a country of slaves. We want to make it a country of modern women. We want to make sure that they get rightful salaries from the world. It's in our hands,\\" he said in Dhaka.      Bangladesh is the world's second-largest apparel maker and the 20 billion industry accounted for up to 80 percent of annual exports last year.      Some activists have said that wages are kept low as trade unions have been hamstrung by government restrictions.      However the Bangladeshi government on Monday approved changes in the labour laws that would make it easier for trade unions to organise themselves.      Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's cabinet \\"approved some amendments to the labour laws that removed the barriers,\\" cabinet secretary Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan told AFP.      Authorities also said they had filed criminal cases against at least 177 garment factories after they failed to ensure safety measures.      The government's chief factory inspector Habibul Islam told AFP that his department filed cases against 161 garment factories in the Dhaka region and 16 against plants based in the city of Chittagong.      \\"We first issued notices against them to fix their safety related problems at their plants. Then we filed cases against them under the country's labour laws after they failed to respond to the our notices,\\" Islam said.      The factory owners face a maximum three months in jail if they're found guilty, he said.      Many of the criminal notices predate the Rana Plaza disaster and previous government crackdowns have resulted in few actual prosecutions.      sa-co/lm |||||","output":"A long time ago, in 2013, a building called Rana Plaza in Bangladesh collapsed. This building had factories where people made clothes. Unfortunately, 1,127 people died because the building was not strong enough.

To make sure that something like this doesn't happen again, many big clothing companies have joined together to make factories in Bangladesh safer. They will help pay for improvements in the factories, like fixing problems and making the building stronger.

Harold Pinter was a celebrated playwright, screenwriter, director, and actor.

Some of his best-known and most influential works include \\"The Birthday Party,\\" \\"The Caretaker,\\" \\"The Homecoming,\\" and \\"Betrayal.\\" Over his career, Pinter wrote more than 30 plays and numerous screenplays for both film and television, including adaptations of his own stage works and novels by other authors. He also directed various stage productions and worked as an actor in theatre, films, and television. In addition to the Nobel Prize in Literature, which he was awarded in 2005, Pinter received numerous other prestigious awards and honors for his work, including the Laurence Olivier Award, PEN International Award, and the BAFTA Fellowship. He was also a recipient of the Golden PEN Award, which is given to a writer for their outstanding contribution to world literature. In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize, Pinter was eloquent and outspoken about the state of human rights, the relationship between art and politics, and the role of an artist in society. Despite his declining health, he continued to work on his artistic pursuits until shortly before his death in December 2008. Today, Harold Pinter remains an enduring figure in the world of theatre, and his inimitable writing and style continue to influence and inspire playwrights, actors, and directors around the globe."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The US rock band had to pull out of their headline slot after Dave Grohl fractured his leg in a stage fall. It's not the first time the festival has had to book a last minute replacement - U2, the Stone Roses and Kylie Minogue have all cancelled appearances due to illness or injury. It's almost as if the Pyramid Stage is cursed... But who is likely to step in for the Foo Fighters on 26 June? Already on the bill, and basking in the afterglow of their third number one album, Florence and the Machine are the most likely choice. Proven festival headliners with a set of earthy, mystical songs they fit neatly with the Glastonbury ethos. Hits like Kiss With A Fist and Shake It Up will sound perfect as the sun sets in Somerset, and their promotion up the bill would help settle a gender imbalance. But singer Florence Welch should be wary of the curse of the Pyramid Stage - she broke her foot while playing Coachella in April. Never bad at Glastonbury, the Britpop survivors played the gig of their lifetime at the 2009 festival. The set was so emotional, Damon Albarn even broke into tears after To The End. A brilliant new album, The Magic Whip, would stop a 2015 set being a repeat performance with songs like Ong Ong and Lonesome Street going down particularly well at the Isle of Wight Festival last weekend. Albarn also has form in helping Glastonbury out of a crisis - he brought his animated hip-hop collective Gorillaz to the main stage when U2 dropped out in 2010. Although it was a poorly received set. A natural substitute for the hard-rocking riffage of the Foo Fighters, AC/DC were widely rumoured to be in the frame for Glastonbury earlier this year. But the band poured cold water on the story, with frontman Brian Johnson describing the festival as \\"wellies and corporate\\". But after hearing Metallica had played in 2014, their attitude softened. \\"If they askâ€¦ OK,\\" said guitarist Angus Young. Detractors say the band has been writing the same exact song over and over for years - but it's a pretty good song, and Glastonbury would be a perfect place to air Highway to Hell and Back in Black. Luckily, they're between dates on their European tour on 26 June. Emily Eavis probably has Chris Martin on speed dial. The band are a reliable Glastonbury stalwart, with anthems aplenty. Glastonbury also gave the band a considerable leg up in 2005, when they were booked to lead the Pyramid Stage while still relatively untested. Nevertheless, they were the talk of the festival afterwards, thanks to a particularly heartfelt rendition of The Scientist. A headline slot would give fans a rare chance to hear last year's well-received Ghost Stories album live - the group only played two UK dates on their brief world tour. But they might want to hold fire until next year. Chris Martin has hinted the band's seventh studio album could be their swansong. Assuming Dave Grohl, the nicest man in rock, doesn't want to leave Glastonbury in the lurch, he could put in a call to his good friends Queens of the Stone Age. Josh Homme's band played a blistering headline set on Glastonbury's Other Stage in 2013, drawing a sizeable crowd despite being scheduled against Beyonce. They're currently in the recording studio, but have scheduled to play Rock in Rio this September, which means they could be battle ready. A popular suggestion on social media, Swift is certainly riding a wave this year, thanks to the  unassailable pop of her new album 1989. Handily, she's in the UK next week and has Friday night off before playing the BST festival in Hyde Park the following day. But it's been a long time since Glastonbury booked such an unashamedly commercial act as its headliner - and while the crowd would undoubtedly lap up Shake It Off and Blank Space, they might find the country elements of her set unpalatable. Maybe she could win the crowd over with a headbanging cover the Foo Fighters' Best of You? Every year, a rumour sweeps around Glastonbury that Daft Punk are \\"definitely\\" playing a secret set over the weekend. Why should this year be any different? See above. He's been listed as a potential headliner for years, and at one point looked set to sign up for   2015.  For whatever reason, negotiations fell apart but a last-minute booking would suit the star's hit-and-run philosophy. If the Minneapolis musician did pop, it would undoubtedly go down as one of Glastonbury's legendary performances. He's at the top of his game, thanks to his muscular, perfectly-drilled new band 3rd Eye Girl - and, as he's fond of telling audiences: \\"I got so many hits we don't have time to play 'em all.\\" But even just the staples of his set - Raspberry Beret, Purple Rain, Let's Go Crazy, Kiss, Little Red Corvette - would be the envy of any headliner. The Chain, Don't Stop, Tusk, Black Magic Woman - Fleetwood Mac have no shortage of hits to supply to the Pyramid Stage. But, it seems, they're not that keen on travelling down to Somerset. Their Isle Of Wight set last weekend was billed as a \\"worldwide festival exclusive\\", and organiser John Giddings claimed Glastonbury bosses were green with envy. \\"Michael Eavis said, 'How did you get Fleetwood Mac?' I said, 'I paid them!'\\" he told Music Week. If the band were to capitulate, though, they'd have to cancel or postpone a show at London's O2 Arena, which is booked for the same night. Muse last headlined Glastonbury in 2010, welcoming The Edge on stage in the year that U2 were forced to pull out. Their star has waned in the intervening years (with the critics, at least) but they are still a thrilling, compelling live act. On their new album, Drones, they've ditched the frilly faux-operatics of their more recent work in favour of proto-metal riffs and Matt Bellamy's soaring vocals. The opportunity to hear Knights of Cydonia charging over the fields of Worthy Farm again is not one to be be missed - but there's one small problem. They're already headlining the Bravalla Festival in Sweden that night.

You might watch and laugh when your dog chases its tail because it looks cute. But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick? Researchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks  at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ). In fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms   are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs   and have to wash their hands many times a day. English soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers   of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria. Hoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample   and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life. Findings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers   and German shepherds   were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes   can cause OCD. Diet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \\"Interestingly, there are indications   that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\\" said researcher Katriina Tiira. Moreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age. The study can help us understand the causes of OCD in humans. \\"Dogs share the same environment with humans, and large animals are physiologically   close to humans,\\" said Hannes Lohi, leader... A:","output":"Which of the following factors is associated with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in dogs based on the article? A. Breed of the dog B. Early separation from their mothers C.

However, it could not be replicated. No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result, scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect. Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his research results. If other scientists had not tried to replicate the research, the truth might never have come out. You can read more about this case at the URL below.  and the situation: John works for the NSF. He has two research proposals in front of him, case A and case B. Both are looking for further funding. Case A research has been replicated by other researchers, but case B research could not be replicated by others. He needs to decide which research should get further funding.  Answer the following question: In which case the scientist would have more likely committed a fraud, case A or case B? A:","output":"In case B, the scientist would have more likely committed a fraud. This is because the research in case B could not be replicated by others, which raises concerns about the validity of the results. In contrast, the research in case A was replicated by other researchers, indicating that the results and methods are more likely to be valid and reliable. Just like the example given in the background, failure to replicate results can be a warning sign of potential fraud or incorrect findings. Thus, John should be cautious when considering funding for case B and pursue further investigation into the reasons behind the lack of replication."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While attending the funeral of his father, Melvin Devereux (John Savage), meets a beautiful young woman (Sandi Schultz) who addresses him by name, although he cannot remember having met her before. After an enigmatic exchange of casual words, Devereux drives away, motoring aimlessly around New Orleans. Devereux decides to ignore warning barriers and drives onto a closed freeway. But the police follow him and he is forced to turn aside. His car breaks down in a decapitated area of the city. But the mysterious young woman again appears, suggesting that he try a mechanic located nearby to fix his car. After helping Devereux push his car to the garage, the young woman again refuses to explain how she knows him or tell him her name. While waiting, the woman suggests they go to a motel nearby, apparently for sex. After checking into a room, and getting ready in the bathroom, Devereux exits and discovers that she is gone, leaving behind a message written on a mirror in red lipstick which says that the time is not yet right.Having collected his repaired vehicle, Devereux encounters a hearse driving on the road ahead. When he attempts to overtake it, the driver (Richard Castleman) deliberately swerves to prevent him. Turning off onto more treacherous country roads, Devereux nearly gets stranded when his car gets stuck in muddy terrain, and he barely negotiates a rickety wooden bridge.At last finding his way back to the main road, he stops off at a local roadside bar for a drink where the hearse is also parked outside. In a drunken altercation, Deveveux challenges the driver to reveal whose body he is transporting. The folded ribbon adorning the casket seen inside the hearse bears a name tantalizingly similar to Devereux's own. The confused, now frightened man follows the hearse to a church where an all-black congregation is mourning at another funeral. Devereux drunkenly disrupts the proceedings, attempting to look inside the closed casket. He gets thrown out of the church by the angry...

Glenn Lee Beck (born February 10, 1964) is an American talk show host, political commentator, and producer. He is the CEO, founder, and owner of Mercury Radio Arts, the parent company of his television and radio network TheBlaze. A conservative, he hosts the Glenn Beck Radio Program, a popular talk-radio show nationally syndicated on Premiere Radio Networks. Beck also hosts the Glenn Beck television program, which ran from January 2006 to October 2008 on HLN, from January 2009 to June 2011 on the Fox News Channel and currently airs on TheBlaze. In 1983 he moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, to work at radio station KZFM. In mid-1985, Beck was hired away from KZFM to be the lead DJ for the morning-drive radio broadcast by WRKA in Louisville, Kentucky. His four-hour weekday show was called Captain Beck and the A-Team. Beck had a reputation as a \\"young up-and-comer\\". The show was not political and included the usual off-color antics of the genre: juvenile jokes, pranks, and impersonations. The show slipped to third in the market and Beck left abruptly in 1987 amid a dispute with WRKA management.  Months later, Beck was hired by Phoenix Top-40 station KOY-FM, then known as Y-95. Beck was partnered with Arizona native Tim Hattrick to co-host a local \\"morning zoo\\" program. During his time at Y-95, Beck cultivated a rivalry with local pop radio station KZZP and that station's morning host Bruce Kelly. Through practical jokes and publicity stunts, Beck drew criticism from the staff at Y-95 when the rivalry culminated in Beck telephoning Kelly's wife on-the-air, mocking her recent miscarriage. In 1989, Beck resigned from Y-95 to accept a job in Houston at KRBE, known as Power 104. Beck was subsequently fired in 1990 due to poor ratings.  Beck then moved on to Baltimore, Maryland, and the city's leading Top-40 station, WBSB, known as B104. There, he partnered with Pat Gray, a morning DJ. During his tenure at B104, Beck was arrested and jailed for speeding in his DeLorean. According to a former associate, Beck was \\"completely out of it\\" when a station manager went to bail him out. When Gray, then Beck were fired, the two men spent six months in Baltimore, planning their next move. In early 1992, Beck and Gray both moved to WKCI-FM (KC101), a Top-40 radio station in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1995, WKCI apologized after Beck and Gray mocked a Chinese-American caller on air who felt offended by a comedy segment by playing a gong sound effect and having executive producer Alf Gagineau mock a Chinese accent. That incident led to protests by activist groups. When Gray left the show to move to Salt Lake City, Beck continued with co-host Vinnie Penn. At the end of 1998, Beck was informed that his contract would not be renewed at the end of 1999.  The Glenn Beck Program first aired in 2000 on WFLA (AM) in Tampa, and took their afternoon time slot from eighteenth to first place within a year. In January 2002, Premiere Radio Networks launched the show nationwide on 47 stations. The show then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, broadcasting from new flagship station WPHT. On November 5, 2007, The New York Times reported that Premiere Radio Networks was extending Beck's contract. By May 2008, it had reached over 280 terrestrial stations as well as XM Satellite. It was ranked 4th in the nation with over six and a half million listeners. As of July 2013, Beck was tied for number four in the ratings behind Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Dave Ramsey.","output":"This text is about Glenn Lee Beck, an American talk show host, political commentator, and producer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the first names of the people Iris and Mikie visit in Boston?, using the article: In turn-of-the-century Oakland, California, the teenaged Myrtle McKinley is expected to follow high school by attending a San Francisco business college. Instead, she takes a job performing with a traveling vaudeville troupe, where she meets and falls in love with singer-dancer Frank Burt. Frank proposes they marry and also entertain on stage together as an act, which proves very popular. Myrtle retires from show business after giving birth to daughters Iris and Mikie, while her husband goes on tour with another partner. A few years later, less successful now, Frank persuades his wife to return to the stage. The girls are cared for by their grandmother as their parents leave town for months at a time. Iris and Mikie are school girls when they are given a trip to Boston to see their parents. Iris meets a well-to-do young man, Bob Clarkman, and is permitted to attend an exclusive boarding school there. She is embarrassed by her parents' profession, however, and mortified at what the reaction will be from Bob and all of her new school friends when they learn that her parents are performing nearby. Myrtle and Frank take matters into their own hands, arranging with the school to have all of the students attend a show. To her great relief, Iris is delighted when her classmates adore her parents' sophisticated act. By the time she's out of school and ready to marry, Iris wants to go into show business herself., what would be the answer ?

Imagine you have 959 red (negative) blocks and 1080 green (positive) blocks. You take away 959 red blocks, then you are left with a difference of blocks. Since there are more green (positive) blocks, we calculate the difference between the two numbers: 1080 - 959 = 121. Since there are more green blocks, our answer is positive. So, -959 + 1080 = 121. Now, our equation is: 121 = -11 * z. To solve for z, we need to undo the multiplication by -11. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -11. So, 121 / -11 = z.

Write a question about the following article: In early 1701, Louis registered Philip's claim to the French throne with the Paris Parlement, raising the possibility of union with Spain, contrary to Charles' will. In February, the Spanish-controlled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy announced their support for Philip and accepted French troops. Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in Swabia and Franconia, these were challenges Leopold could not ignore. At the same time, French garrisons took over Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, helped by the Spanish Viceroy and French ally Max Emanuel of Bavaria. This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of Münster. It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of Antwerp and Ostend would allow France to blockade the Channel at will. In response, Leopold, the Dutch Republic and Britain signed the Treaty of The Hague on 7 September 1701 renewing the 1689 Grand Alliance. Provisions included securing the Dutch Barrier in the Spanish Netherlands, the Protestant succession in England and Scotland and an independent Spain but made no reference to placing Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne. When the Stuart exile James II died on 16 September, Louis reneged on his commitment at Ryswick to recognise William as King by proclaiming James Francis Edward King of England and Scotland. The vast majority in Britain now supported war and after William's death on 19 March 1702, Queen Anne announced the continuation of his policies ie ensuring the Protestant succession and resisting French expansion.

A restaurant has kicked out a customer who refused to take off his Google Glass. Nick Starr was at the Lost Lake Cafe in Seattle on November 21 and wearing the glasses, which allow users to take pictures and record audio or video, when he was asked to remove them. But he refused to take them off and was eventually asked to leave - sparking an online spat between Starr and the restaurant, and raising the debate about how invasive the gadget is. Complaining about the incident on his Facebook page, Starr explained that he and his boyfriend were at the cafe and looking at the menus when a manager approached them, KIRO reported. Scroll down for video. Dispute: Nick Starr left a Seattle restaurant after he was ordered to remove his Google Glass, pictured. 'She tells me that. the owner's other restaurant doesn't allow Google Glass and that I would. have to either put it away or leave,' he wrote. 'I... asked to see where it was policy for Glass to be disallowed at Lost. Lake. She said she couldn't provide any and when asked to speak with. management she stated she was the night manager.' Refusing to remove the glasses, Starr and his boyfriend left. He vented on his Facebook post, demanding an apology from the restaurant and calling for the woman's termination. He added that he thought it was bizarre that the restaurant asked customers to shares images on social networking sites of their experiences there, but banned the Glass. Scene: The manager at the Lost Lake Cafe asked him to remove the glasses in accordance with their policy. Anger: Restaurant owner David Meinert, pictured, said he thought the glasses were invasive. But the Lost Lake Cafe has refused to apologize, saying that they have other customers' interests in mind. They shot back at Starr with their own Facebook post, outlining its policy. 'We recently had to ask a rude. customer to leave because of their insistence on wearing and operating. Google Glasses inside the restaurant,' the statement said. 'We. kindly ask our customers to refrain from wearing and operating Google. Glasses inside Lost Lake. We also ask that you not videotape anyone. using any other sort of technology. 'If you do wear your Google Glasses. inside, or film or photograph people without their permission, you will. be asked to stop, or leave.

Night out: Starr was out with his boyfriend, Brian (left), when they were approached by the manager. Fan: Starr said he wears the glasses everywhere and argued you can also take pictures with cell phones. Owner David Meinert, who banned Google Glass at another one of his restaurants earlier this year, said he felt uneasy about the device. 'I think they're invasive and they make people uncomfortable,' he told KOMO News. 'More than that they make me uncomfortable, and it's my place.' But Starr countered that he believes Google Glass is no more intrusive than cell phones with cameras that are also capable of taking images. 'I think privacy is vapor now,' Starr said. 'There are cameras everywhere. There are recording devices everywhere.' See below for video. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The article discusses an incident that took place in 2013 at the Lost Lake Cafe in Seattle, where a customer, Nick Starr, was asked to remove his Google Glass device by the café's management.

British scientists found no difference in the rate of live babies born whether the man was in his 40s or 20s. Women were slightly more likely to have a baby if the sperm was donated by a middle-aged man rather than a younger donor. A quarter of sperm used in UK clinics comes from abroad, namely Denmark. Study carried out at Newcastle Fertility Centre found sperm quality rather than a man's age is key to conceiving. Experts said it could be down to the fact older donors are more likely to have families of their own and therefore a proven fertility track record. Article:","output":"Title: Male Age and Fertility: A Groundbreaking Study Dispels Age-related Myths Introduction For years, there has been significant focus on the impact of a woman's age on fertility, with the biological clock often cited as a primary concern. However, far less attention has been paid to the effect of male age on fertility and conception rates. A recent groundbreaking study conducted by British scientists at Newcastle Fertility Centre has shed light on this issue, dispelling common myths surrounding the link between age and male fertility. Major Study on Male Age and Fertility The first major study of its kind, the research conducted by British scientists investigated the effect of male age on fertility, specifically focusing on the rate of live babies born. The results provided compelling evidence that there was no significant difference in the rate of live babies born to men in their 40s compared to their counterparts in their 20s. Furthermore, the study found that women were slightly more likely to have a baby if the sperm was donated by a middle-aged man rather than a younger donor. This interesting discovery highlights the fact that sperm quality – not a man's age – is the key factor when it comes to conceiving a child. Sperm Donation in the UK The study's findings are particularly relevant to the United Kingdom, where a quarter of the sperm used in fertility clinics is sourced from abroad, with Denmark being a major contributor. The reliance on foreign sperm donors has often raised concerns about the impact of age on sperm quality. However, the findings of this study suggest that age may not be as significant a factor as previously thought. Older Donors and Fertility Track Record One possible explanation for the slightly higher likelihood of women having a baby using sperm from middle-aged men is that older donors are more likely to have families of their own, showcasing a proven fertility track record. This suggests that the quality of sperm is at least partially shaped by factors beyond the age of the male donor, such as their overall health, lifestyle choices and genetic makeup. Implications and Conclusion The groundbreaking study conducted by Newcastle Fertility Centre has significant implications for prospective parents as well as fertility clinics and sperm banks. By debunking the myth that male age is a critical factor for fertility, this research allows both individuals and professionals to focus on more crucial aspects such as sperm quality and overall health when considering conception. In conclusion, the findings offer a fresh perspective on male fertility and emphasize the importance of looking beyond age when evaluating a man's ability to father a child. The study serves as a reminder that fertility is a complex matter influenced by a range of factors, and ultimately, that a man's age may not be as critical as once believed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device First-half goals from Paul Robinson, Dean Parrett and Poleon effectively ended the tie as a contest. The hosts continued to impress after the break, dominating a disjointed Bury backline and adding to their lead through Poleon and Lyle Taylor. Robinson slammed the Dons in front on 27 minutes, converting Taylor's deft low cross from close range. They doubled their lead five minutes later as Parrett sidefooted past goalkeeper Ben Williams after a mix-up in the Bury defence. The visitors' defending was poor and they conceded a third in first-half stoppage time, Robinson unselfishly sliding in Poleon for the third. AFC Wimbledon - who were without a win in four matches previously - were producing some excellent football in front of their home crowd and Poleon underlined their dominance by getting his second and the home side's fourth goal on 72 minutes. The impressive Taylor then added his name to the scoresheet by ripping a powerful shot into the far corner 10 minutes from time. The result piles more misery on the visitors, who have not won in their last 11 games in all competitions. Report supplied by the Press Association Match ends, AFC Wimbledon 5, Bury 0.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Which works require three voices including a narrator? , can you please find it?   (English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento.Plans for Armida's performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy... Answer:","output":"The works that require three voices, including a narrator, are Il combattimento and Armida abbandonata. Both of these works are mentioned in the provided text and exhibit structural similarities to one another."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Flapper Filosofy ( sometimes called Flapper Filosophy ) was a newspaper comic panel distributed by King Features Syndicate and the O'Dell Newspaper Service . It ran during the flapper era of the 1920s into the early 1930s . The art was by Faith Burrows . Each panel exhibited a flapper wearing one of the current fashions , with a witticism typed at the bottom . Burrows drew her panels at an image size of 3 \`\` × 6 '' on Bristol boards measuring 3 \`\` × 6 '' . Burrows ' series ran in competition for a time with Ethel Hays ' similarly themed and well - established Flapper Fanny Says panel from NEA . As writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Anita Loos , and illustrators such as Burrows , Hays , Russell Patterson and John Held Jr. popularized the flapper look and lifestyle through their works , flappers came to be seen as attractive , reckless and independent .  - Faith Swank Burrows (November 17, 1904  April 11, 1997) was a nationally syndicated cartoonist during the Jazz Age.  - The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties.  - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.  - An editorial cartoon, also known as a political cartoon, is an illustration containing a commentary that usually relates to current events or personalities. An artist who draws such images is known as an editorial cartoonist.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - Flappers were a generation of young Western women in the 1920s who wore short skirts, bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner, smoking, driving automobiles, and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms. Flappers had their origins in the liberal period of the Roaring Twenties, the social, political turbulence and increased transatlantic cultural exchange that followed the end of World War I, as well as the export of American jazz culture to Europe.  - The Roaring Twenties is a term for Western society and culture in the 1920s. It was a period of sustained economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, particularly in major cities such as New York City, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit, Paris, Berlin, London and Los Angeles. In France and Quebec, it was known as the \\"\\"années folles\\"\\" (\\"Crazy Years\\"), emphasizing the era's social, artistic and cultural dynamism. Jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, Art Deco peaked, and, in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism after World War I, normalcy returned to politics. This era saw the large-scale use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, radio, and electricity; commercial, passenger, and freight aviation; as well as unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand, plus significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media focused on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars, as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums. In most major democracies, women won the right to vote.  - Print syndication distributes news articles, columns, comic strips and other features to newspapers, magazines and websites.

In a puzzle, one is required to put pieces together in a logical way, in order to arrive at the correct solution of the puzzle. There are different types of puzzles for different ages, such as crossword puzzles, word-search puzzles, number puzzles, or logic puzzles.  - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements.

Speaking before Sunday's road race, a tearful Armitstead told BBC Sport she would \\"never cheat in life\\". \\"In this situation I'm never going to win. If I win, people will say it's because of something else,\\" she added. The Yorkshire rider, who won a silver medal at London 2012, is among the favourites to triumph in Rio after winning a Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) appeal. She had her first missed test rescinded after Cas ruled the doping official \\"didn't do what was reasonable and necessary\\" to find her. Armitstead says she was \\"in the place where I should have been\\" and points out she gave a negative test the following day at the UCI Women Road World Cup. The second strike, relating to an inconsistency on a form over her whereabouts, was a \\"stupid mistake\\" which came shortly after she became world champion last year. She would not discuss the \\"traumatic\\" family circumstances which led to missing the third test earlier this year. Had her appeal not been successful, Armitstead would have faced a ban of up to two years.

He says that \\"birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates\\" and \\"penguins are a type of birds\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"The term \\"endothermic tetrapod vertebrates\\" is a scientific description of a group of animals. Let's break the term down:  - Endothermic refers to an organism's ability to regulate its own body temperature by internal means. In simple terms, it means the organism is warm-blooded. - Tetrapod means four-legged. However, in scientific nomenclature, it refers to animals that are descendants from four-legged ancestors, even if they have evolved to have fewer limbs (like snakes or birds). - Vertebrate refers to having a backbone or spinal column. So, an endothermic tetrapod vertebrate is a warm-blooded animal that descends from four-legged ancestors and has a backbone.  The teacher gave two hints: \\"Birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates\\" and \\"Penguins are a type of birds\\". Therefore, based on these hints, we can specifically identify that penguins (option D) fit into the category of endothermic tetrapod vertebrates.  To summarize, the term \\"endothermic tetrapod vertebrates\\" is a broad category that includes many animals. Mammals (option A) and humans (option C) also fit into this category because they are warm-bloodd (option F), have a backbone, and are descendant from four-legged ancestors. However, with the given hints by the teacher, the best answer to this question is penguins (option D) because they are birds (also endothermic tetrapod vertebrates) and the statement directly specifies them. Also, it's worth noting that though jellyfish (option E) are animals (option H) they are not endothermic, not tetrapods, and not vertebrates. They are marine invertebrates. Clouds (option B) are not relevant to the question as they are not a biological entity. So, the correct answer to the question \\"what are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates?\\" given the hints by the teacher would be D. Penguins."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has... Question: How long did it take for Comey to write his book?

A password is considered strong if (a) it has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters; (b) it contains at least one lowercase letter and one uppercase letter, and at least one digit; (c) it does not contain three repeating characters in a row. In one step you can: (1) Insert one character to password, (2) delete one character from password, or (3) replace one character of password with another character. Input: password = LBdHc8p3RwkHLUukWvfMqwSZ.kXt3KK5nwenQu Output:","output":"The task is asking you to take a given password and modify it so that it meets certain criteria of a strong password.  So, the guidelines that it gives are: 1. The password has to be at least 6 characters long and at most 20 characters long. 2. It needs to contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit. 3. It cannot have three repeating characters in a row. The task also mentions three operations you can perform on the password, each operation counts as a step: 1. Insert one character into the password. 2. Delete one character from the password. 3. Replace one character in the password with another character. Now, let's use these guidelines to come up with a strategy to finish the task: 1. Start by checking the length of the password. If its length is less than 6 or more than 20, you'll need to add or delete characters respectively. 2. Check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit. If it does not meet these criteria, you'll need to replace some characters. 3. Finally, scan through the password to identify any instances where a character is repeated three times in a row. Each instance will require a replacement operation. The output of the task is the total number of steps required to convert the given password into a strong password. For the given task: password = LBdHc8p3RwkHLUukWvfMqwSZ.kXt3KK5nwenQu It's easy to see that the password is way longer than 20 characters, it has all the types of characters needed - uppercase, lowercase, and a digit, and contains three repeating characters 'uuu'. So we need to delete or replace the excess characters (length 41 - max length 20) and replace one of 'u' in 'uuu'. Therefore, the steps would equal to number of excess characters. In this case, I count 21 steps - 20 to delete the excessive characters and 1 to replace one 'u' from the three 'u's. So the output of the task is: 21"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Researchers at the University of Bristol have developed and started studying a novel concept in robotics--intelligent handheld robots. Historically, handheld tools have been straight, unintelligent instruments that are _ of the context they operate in, are fully directed by the user, and therefore, lack any understanding about the task they are performing. Dr. Walterio Mayol-Cuevas and PhD student, Austin Gregg-Smith, from the University's Department of Computer Science, have been working in the design of the robot as well as in understanding how best to be with a tool that \\"knows and acts\\". Compared to other tools such as power tools that have a motor and perhaps some basic sensors  , the handheld robots developed at Bristol are designed to have more degrees of freedom to allow greater independence from the instructions of the user, and importantly, understand the steps being carried out. This allows for a new level of co-operation between user and tool, such as the user providing directions and the tool performing the detailed task. Handheld robots, aim to share physical similarity with users but are neither fully independent as is a humanoid robot nor are part of the user's body. The aim with handheld robots is to develop the intuitiveness   of using traditional handheld tools while adding planted intelligence and action to allow for new abilities. Dr. Mayol-Cuevas, Reader in Robotics Computer Vision and Mobile Systems, said, \\"There are three basic levels of autonomy   we are considering: no autonomy, semi-autonomous when the robot advises the user but does not act, and fully autonomous when the robot advises and acts even by correcting or refusing to perform incorrect user actions.\\" Question: What can we learn from the passage? Options: A: The handheld robots can never disobey the user's order. B: The autonomy is the only thing that the scientists are considering.

Jemel Roberson, 26, was shot dead by a Midlothian police officer responding to a shooting inside Manny’s Blue Room Bar in Robbins, Illinois, about 4 a.m. Sunday. Witnesses said officers shot at the wrong man.      \\"Everybody was screaming out, 'Security!' He was a security guard,\\" witness Adam Harris said. \\"And they still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him.\\"      It all began when security asked a group of drunken men to leave Manny's shortly before 4 a.m. Sunday. Witnesses said someone came back with a gun and opened fire. Security returned fire, witnesses said, and Roberson was able to detain one of the men involved outside.      \\"He had somebody on the ground with his knee in back, with his gun in his back, like, 'Don’t move,'\\" Harris said.      Soon after, according to witnesses, an officer responding to the scene shot at Roberson — killing him.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said Roberson had a valid FOID card, but did not have a concealed-carry license.      In a statement, Midlothian police confirmed two officers from the department responded to the scene of the shooting and that one of them opened fire.      \\"A Midlothian officer encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an officer-involved shooting. The subject the officer shot was later pronounced deceased at an area hospital,\\" Chief Daniel Delaney of the Midlothian Police Department said in a statement.      Friends said Roberson was an upstanding guy who had plans to become a police officer. He was also a musician, playing keyboard and drums at several Chicago-area churches.      \\"Every artist he’s ever played for, every musician he’s ever sat beside, we’re all just broken because we have no answers,\\" the Rev. Patricia Hill from Purposed Church said. \\"He was getting ready to train and do all that stuff, so the very people he wanted to be family with, took his life.\\"      \\"Once again, it’s the continued narrative that we see of shoot first, ask questions later,\\" the Rev. LeAundre Hill said.      The Cook County Sheriff's Office is handling the criminal investigation of the original shooting, while the State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the police-involved shooting.      Roberson's family said in addition to the holding the officer who shot him responsible, his family wants Roberson to be remembered as a hero.      His family and friends believe there was a racial element to the situation because the cop who shot him was white. Law enforcement has not confirmed the race of the officer.      The lawsuit seeks damages in excess of 1 million.      A GoFundMe page has been set up to help cover funeral costs. Click here for more information.

Lawyers for Roberson’s family said Tuesday night that he was the father of a 9-month old son named Tristan. The child’s mother, Avontea Boose, is currently pregnant with their their second child, according to a statement from Merritt Law Office.      Meanwhile, Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delany changed his description of Roberson on Tuesday, at first describing him as a “subject with a gun” and later referring to him as “a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny’s Blue Room.”      Delany initially said “there were conflicting reports of whether he was the suspect or a security guard” in the Sunday morning shooting.      But it’s now known that Roberson was attempting to diffuse a shooting situation that had broken out in the bar.      An attorney representing Roberson’s family has also said Roberson was doing his job when he apprehended a shooting suspect when Midlothian police arrived on the scene.      The still-unnamed officer fired shots, striking and killing Roberson.      Demonstrators gathered Tuesday in front of the police department, calling for “Justice for Jemel” and asking for a thorough investigation.      “We won’t get justice tomorrow–we won’t get justice today,” Roberson’s friend Stringer Harris said.      Roberson’s attorney says Roberson was wearing a hat and shirt with the word “security” on both items of clothing at the time of the shooting.      A photo taken in September shows Roberson in a security shirt, and a friend told CBS 2 he would have typically worn the ensemble to a shift at the night club.      Midlothian police did not respond to a request from CBS 2 for bodycam video.      The officer involved is currently on paid administrative leave pending the results of a state investigation. ||||| (CNN) A suburban Chicago police officer responding to a shooting Sunday at a bar killed a security guard who was just \\"doing his job,\\" an attorney for the slain man's family said.      An officer from Midlothian, Illinois, fatally shot Jemel Roberson, a 26-year-old security guard working at the bar, Cook County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Sophia Ansari told CNN.      Law enforcement agencies responded to the shooting around 4 a.m. at Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins, about 20 miles south of Chicago, Ansari said. Three people and an alleged shooter were injured, she added.      Then, after Roberson had apprehended an alleged gunman, the Midlothian officer shot Roberson outside the bar, according to a federal lawsuit filed Monday that calls the fatal shooting \\"excessive and unreasonable\\" and says it violated Roberson's civil rights.      Witnesses said security had asked several drunk men to leave the bar, and at least one person returned and opened fire, CNN affiliate WGN reported. A bartender was among those victims, according to the lawsuit.      After that shooting, Roberson \\"had somebody on the ground ... with his knee in back, with his gun in his back like, 'Don't move,' \\" Adam Harris, a witness, told WGN.      The officer responding to the scene then fired at Roberson, the TV station reported, citing witnesses.      \\"We all yelled. 'He's a security. He's a security,' and without ... giving any thought, they shot him,\\" Harris told the station . \\"The vest said security as well ... and they shot him in the side.\\"      The Midlothian Police Department has asked the Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force to investigate, which is department policy for an officer-involved shooting, according to Midlothian police Chief Daniel Delaney.      In a statement, the Illinois State Police said its officials are investigating the shooting. It said that according to witness statements, \\"the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject.\\"      It also said Roberson was in plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a security guard and armed with a gun.      The department did not initially identify Roberson as a security guard because it immediately relinquished the investigation to the State Police and did not know his name or position at the time, Delaney said Tuesday.      \\"What we have learned is Jemel Roberson was a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny's Blue Room,\\" Delaney wrote on Facebook.      \\"The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel , his family and his friends. There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with.\\"      The suspected gunman in the initial bar shooting is being treated at a local hospital and has not been charged, Ansari said.      'Jemel was trying to save people's lives'      The lawsuit filed by Roberson's mother lists the unnamed Midlothian officer and the village of Midlothian as defendants. It seeks damages of more than 1 million.      \\"Jemel was trying to save people's lives. He was working security because a shooting had just taken place in the establishment,\\" the family's attorney, Gregory Kulis, told CNN affiliate WLS      \\"So, he was doing his job and holding on to somebody until ... police arrived,\\" Kulis said. \\"And a police officer, our feeling is, did not make the proper assessment and fired and killed Jemel.\\"      Roberson had a Firearms Owners' Identification Card, which allows Illinois residents to legally possess firearms or ammunition, according to Ansari.      Midlothian police confirmed that two of its officers responded to the bar shooting and one opened fire, WGN reported      \\"A Midlothian officer encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an officer-involved shooting. The subject the officer shot was later pronounced deceased at an area hospital,\\" Delaney said in an earlier statement.      The officer involved in the shooting is a four-year veteran of the police department, WLS reported, citing Delaney.      Karen Sheley, director of the Police Practices Project for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, suggested that Roberson's race influenced the decision to shoot.      \\"Working as a security guard while Black should not be a death sentence. In this case, police were more dangerous to him than an active shooter who he apparently subdued,\\" Sheley said in a statement      \\"The police killing of Mr. Roberson was avoidable. Here, a police officer's assumptions about Mr. Roberson, apparently impacted by bias, rather than a clear-headed assessment of the situation, resulted in a tragedy.\\"      A church musician who wanted to be a cop      Jemel Roberson is seen with his young son, who is now 9 months old.      Roberson was the father to a 9-month-old son, and the boy's mother is expecting their second child, according to family attorney S. Lee Merritt.      He was a gospel musician at several churches, according to according to WGN . Kulis said Roberson played the organ and was scheduled to perform at church on the Sunday morning he was killed.      Roberson was also preparing to embark on a career as a police officer, WGN reported. Roberson had planned to take a police exam in March, according to Eric Russell, an activist.      \\"The very people that he wanted to be family with took his life,\\" the Rev. Patricia Hill of Purposed Church said.      Roberson's family members are \\"just distraught,\\" another pastor, the Rev. Walter Turner, said.      \\"They are hurt, trying to find out answers, trying to figure out why did this have to happen,\\" Turner told the TV station.      Loved ones and supporters held a vigil Monday night outside Manny's Blue Room Lounge, WGN reported. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The case involves the fatal shooting of Jemel Roberson, a 26-year-old security guard, by a Midlothian police officer while he was trying to detain a man involved in a shooting at Manny's Blue Room Bar in Robbins, Illinois. Prominent details shared were: the incident began when a group of drunken men were asked to leave the bar, after which one returned with a gun and opened fire; Roberson subdued and detained one of the men outside the bar; despite being identified as a security guard by witnesses, Roberson was shot by a police officer responding to the scene. The lawsuit was filed by Roberson's family against the officer who shot him and the city's police department, seeking damages in excess of 1 million. Witnesses, family, and friends narrated that Roberson was an upstanding individual with plans of a future career as a policeman and remembered him as a hero. The incident brought on sorrow and outrage, with many suggesting that racial bias influenced the tragedy. Official investigations are being conducted by the Cook County Sheriff's Office and the State Police Public Integrity Task Force."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence.  Question: \\"Who is a well-known figure in the Muslim community who worshipers at the Quds mosque describe as an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist?\\" Response: \\"Outspoken, flamboyant Islamist\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

Context: Vinyl records can be warped by heat, improper storage, exposure to sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap on the album cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for it was part of the art of turntable and tonearm design. \\"wow\\" (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover.

Article: You do not need every word to understand the meaning of what you read. In fact, too much emphasis   on separate words both slows your speed and reduces your comprehension. First, any habit which slows down your silent reading to the speed at which you speak or read aloud, is inefficient. If you point to each word as you read, or move your head, or form the words with your lips, you read poorly. Less obvious habits also hold back reading efficiency  . One is \\"saying\\" each word silently by moving your tongue or throat; another is \\"hearing\\" each word as you read. These are habits which should have been outgrown long ago. The beginning reader is learning how letters can make words, how written words are pronounced, and how sentences are put together. Your reading purpose is quite different, which is to understand meaning. It has been supposed that up to 75% of the words in English sentences are not really necessary for expressing the meaning. The secret of silent reading is to find out those key words and phrases which carry the thought, and to pay less attention to words which exist only for grammatical completeness. An efficient reader can grasp the meaning from a page at least twice as fast as he can read the page aloud. He takes in a whole phrase or thought unit at a time.

All in the 'Tude? What do you think Jen Aniston could possibly see in John Mayer? He's been drinking too much koo-koo-kool-aid in my book. Doesn't that seem like an odd match? -- Submitted during last week's Celebritology Live discussion Koo-koo-Koolaid or not, 30-year-old John Mayer seems to have an almost Lance Armstrong-esque ability to attract his choice of A-list (okay, maybe B) lady loves: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jessica Simpson, Minka Kelly, among others. And, now, Hollywood untouchable Jennifer Aniston. Just last week, pictures of Mayer snogging with Aniston poolside in Miami hit the net with all the force of Brangelina baby bump shot. And not only is Mayer considered a jumbo-sized chick magnet, he apparently has the ability to love 'em and leave 'em, rendering his exes inconsolable: Last week, a drunken Jessica Simspon was rumored to have been removed from a Hollywood hotel bar on the same day the JenJohn (remember, you heard that portmanteau here first!) pix surfaced on the Web. Coincidence? Maybe. (Of course, Simpson's debauchery could also have been a reaction to rumors of a split from most recent boyfriend Tony Romo.) Is it, as pal Josh Groban says, Mayer's \\"swagger\\" and \\"'tude,\\" or something else that makes him such a catch? Mayer claims he's just a nice guy. \\"I don't have a secret,\\" Mayer recently told People. \\"I don't think about it like that. I think about it as just being nice. All you have to do is just be polite and treat people really well.\\" For the record, the date-ready Mayer has never taken any of his romantic relationships to the cohabitation level. According to Wikipedia, Mayer \\"splits his time between his home in the Los Angeles suburbs (with his roommate and sound engineer, Chad Franscoviak) and his apartment in the New York City neighborhood of SoHo.\\" Comment of the Week \\"I can't believe i finally have something in common with Gwyneth.

But the former \\"Friend\\" has been glowing of late, pals of the actress tell us. The reason can't just be that she is dating John Mayer. What we hear is there is a certain feature of John that leaves Jen so pleased. The crooner's ex-paramours reveal he is hell to get over, not because he's a great guy, but because he's a \\"great\\" guy, if you know what we mean. \\"His body actually is a wonderland,\\" one ex was overheard saying.

Posted by: Juicy | May 19, 2008 3:05 PM I guess nobody on this site is much of a music fan because John M. is a phenomenal musician. Eric Clapton was one of his mentors - the man is now close to SRV-legend territory. \\"Wonderland\\" and \\"Daughters\\" are definitely his lamest songs - I believe he begged his record label not to release \\"Daughters\\" as a single. Anyway - his last CD, \\"Continuum\\" has quite a number of terrific bluesy songs. Great lyrics, too. (Although I have to admit that the song he wrote for the \\"Bucket List\\" movie was also pretty lame.) There aren't very many \\"Singer-Songwriter\\" types around anymore (i.e., Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Clapton, Winwood, etc) - so this kid's music is pretty refreshing. BTW - as a middle-aged woman, I appreciate the fact that he talks about his parents in some of his songs - what a nice boy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Wilfully eclectic, Leftism never settled on a single genre, dabbling in tribal, trance, dub, house and ambient music. The quality never dipped, proving that a long-form dance record - one that worked as a coherent suite of music rather than a collection of 12-inch singles - was possible. It was among the first British albums to bring the club into the living room, alongside releases by The Chemical Brothers, Underworld and The Prodigy. The duo behind Leftfield, Neil Barnes and Paul Daley, had started out in punk bands, and retained the ethos that \\"music that takes from other places but moves on\\". To that end, they borrowed from Afrobeat, indie and punk itself - even cajoling former Sex Pistol John Lydon into singing the album's breakout single Open Up. These days Barnes continues to record and perform as Leftfield (with Daley's blessing) and, starting on Thursday, he embarks on a UK tour in which Leftism will be played in full for the first time. The project was initially planned for the record's 20th anniversary, but is only coming to fruition now, in its 22nd year. Ahead of the tour dates, Barnes and Daley chatted to the BBC about the making of Leftism, its impact, and their ear-splitting live shows. What do you remember about the making of Leftism? Paul Daley: Lots of late nights on the computer, synths and samplers in the week and then I was off DJing at the weekends. It was all very fast moving and constantly evolving, much like the scene at the time. Neil Barnes: A lot of stuff was done on the fly. We were just being creative in the studio. We weren't completely into indie, we weren't completely into techno. We'd get bored and think, 'We've done a [dance] track, now let's do something down-tempo, or a hip-hop track.' Is that why it still sounds fresh today? NB: I think the thing about the album is that it takes you on a journey through electronic music. There isn't one style. It's unusual in that, I think. PD: I wanted the album to sound exotic, have its own identity and have its own place amongst everything else around at the time. That time was great for music in the UK and as time goes by the '90s, and what happened creatively, is only now coming into focus and I'm really chuffed what we did is considered as something special. Leftism is frequently cited as a breakthrough, in that it showed dance music could work in an album format. Was that your intention? PD: It had to be more than a collection of instrumental formula dance records but I didn't really know it worked until I was editing it together at the end. It was a calculated risk at the time but not really intentional. Happy accidents, and all that. What's the most unusual instrument on the album? NB: There's a berimbau at the start of Afro Left. It's probably the oldest instrument, aside from hitting a drum, in the world. It's a stringed instrument from Brazil, and they hit it with a pebble. I'll be bringing it on the tour with me. John Lydon has called Open Up one of his favourite lyrics. Did you realise it was special at the time? NB: I think it's one of the best songs he ever wrote. When he came in and did the vocal, we realised we had to get the rest of the backing track up to the standard of the lyric. His vocal performance was so incredible, we felt we needed to match it. We changed the bassline radically and added a lot more drums. Your live shows got a reputation for being louder than Concorde. How bad was it? NB: The speakers were so loud your eyeballs would vibrate. Did you really make plaster fall off the roof of Brixton Academy? NB: A whole bit of the ceiling came down, not just a few chunks. You could see it all over the dancefloor. I've seen worse, though. We once shook a metal grating off when we played a soundcheck in a university. It came down and hit the floor. If anyone had been near it, they'd have been dead. I was terrified. And we brought a whole bar down in Amsterdam. When our sound man fired up the system, it all came down. Bottles, glasses, everything, flying off the wall. Who paid for it? I have no idea. What made you decide to revisit the album now? NB: It just seems like a good time to say \\"bon voyage\\" to Leftism. I'm not really going to be playing these songs much more. How hard has it been to recreate the record for the tour? NB: It's an unbelievable job of forensic investigation. It's taken months. The album didn't go onto tape at the time, so we've gone back to the raw files to find stuff and build the sounds up so it sounds like the album. Is the concert a faithful rendition of the album? NB: It is, but all the tracks are expanded. Some of them are 12 minutes long now. Like Release The Pressure, I've incorporated the single [mix] into the album version, so you get a bit of Cheshire Cat's vocals. And there's no encore. 20th Century Poem was always going to be the closer. Paul, do you miss playing live? Will you go to see the shows? PD: I don't really miss anything as I find \\"missing\\" things can be negative. I have great memories and still get a buzz from DJing which, in my eyes, is and always has been a performance and artform. People come up to me and shake my hand for what I did in Leftfield between 1989 and 2002 and that's enough for me. Finally, what do you see as Leftism's legacy? Who are your direct descendants? PD: Anyone who's thought, \\"I'm going to buy some decks, synths, samplers and make a record\\" since 1989. Also anyone who has thought, \\"I can make a record in my bedroom today and play it in my DJ set at the weekend\\". That was the revolution that has had a massive impact on musical history and which we were part of and it just seems to roll on and get handed down to the next generation for them to put their own stamp on it. By no means are Leftfield wholly responsible - but we were part of a forward-thinking global musical movement that exploded at the end of the 20th Century and turned pop culture on it's head. Leftism 22 is out now on Sony. Leftfield tour the album around the UK for the rest of the month, starting in Bristol on Thursday 11, May.

When Anoop Kapitan left his home in South Africa to come to the UK in 1970, he had no idea it would be the last time he would see his brother for more than four decades. Anoop moved to Glasgow aged 20 to study at Strathclye University, but just a few years later his elder brother Karan moved to Australia, where he set up an accountancy firm. The pair kept in touch via letter, and then email, but had not seen each other face to face for 44 year until they met in Melbourne in December. Anoop had virtually given up hope of seeing his relative again after being diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1999, when doctors told him he only had ten years of normal life left. Scroll down for video. Anoop (left) and Karan Kapitan embrace as they meet each other for the first time in 44 years after they both moved away from the family home in South Africa to opposite sides of the world. Anoop studied in Glasgow before settling in Yorkshire, while Karan moved to Melbourne. When Anoop was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1999, he virtually gave up hope of seeing his brother again. Mr Kapitan said: 'My elder brother is in his late seventies now. He emigrated to Australia where he lived his life, and I lived my life in the UK. 'We both led very hectic lives – I travelled a lot with my job as a troubleshooting engineer for a big company, whilst Karan was busy establishing a successful accountancy firm in Melbourne. 'Up until this point, neither of us had the time to reconnect. 'I have travelled to 49 countries around the world including North Thailand and Turkey, so this landmark trip to Australia marked my fiftieth country.' Anoop grew up in his family home in Johannesburg where his parents ran the famous Kapitan's restaurant which was visited by Nelson Mandela and his wife Winnie. Aged 20 he left to study in Glasgow, before settling in Holmfirth, Yorkshire, where he raised a family and now has two children. Anoop and Karan (pictured bottom right, and top centre) grew up in Johannesburg where their parents owned the famous Kapitan's restaurant, frequented by Nelson Mandela and his wife Winnie. Anoop travelled to 49 different countries as part of his job as an engineer, but had never been to Australia until he was reunited with Karan after more than four decades. A few years after he departed South Africa his brother Karan also left the family home, but he went the opposite way, travelling to Melbourne where he started a business. In 1999, while Anoop was only in his Forties, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and given just ten years to live a normal life, so he never expected to see his relative again. But Qatar Airways and Manchester Airport arranged a flight for him to Melborne, where the pair were tearfully reunited in December last year. Anoop added: 'I longed to be with family again. I don't know what kind of man I will find when I get to Australia, but I will do my utmost to win his heart again. 'I was apprehensive before meeting Karan and felt nervous and a bit overwhelmed, but when I saw him standing there at the arrivals gate all my worries just disappeared.

Question: Who fell to their death in the chambers lava pit? Title: King Solomon's Mines Movie plot: Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) hires Allan Quatermain to find her father, believed lost on an expedition to find the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the last name of Drake's mentor?  Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic.

He seeks help from a renowned therapist named Dr. Elden. In these surreal dreams, his closest friend Jane always seems to be involved, often as a malevolent figure pursuing and attacking him. Act 2: Dr. Elden suggests that Brooks participates in a cutting-edge therapy treatment involving a new technique called dream-sharing. This procedure allows Brooks and his therapist to explore and navigate his nightmares together to find answers. As they delve deeper into Brooks' perilous dream world, they become increasingly convinced of Jane's involvement in his recurring nightmares. Brooks confronts Jane about the situation, but she denies any connection to his dreams. However, the nightmares grow even more vivid and intense, making Brooks question their friendship and ultimately suspect that Jane may hold a dark secret. Act 3: As Brooks continues to investigate his own mind, he and Dr. Elden uncover a repressed childhood memory involving Jane, a tragic incident that led to the death of another friend. In reality, Jane has blamed herself for the accident and always felt a deep sense of guilt. Unconsciously, this guilt has manifested itself in Brooks' dreams as recurring nightmares, projecting Jane as a murderer.

Here is a goal: To get more from each melon when using a melon baller. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Available options: a). Use the larger end of the melon baller.; b). Use the smaller end of the melon baller.;","output":"To accomplish the goal of getting more from each melon when using a melon baller, both options, a) using the larger end of the melon baller and b) using the smaller end, have their advantages and disadvantages. The optimal choice for you would depend on what you value more: the amount of melon balls created, the size of the melon balls, or reducing the potential waste of the melon's flesh. Option A: Use the larger end of the melon baller Advantages:  1. Larger melon balls: The larger end of the melon baller will create bigger melon balls, which would result in more melon to eat per ball. This could look more aesthetically pleasing in fruit salads, and larger melon balls may be more enjoyable to eat due to their size. 2. Faster scooping: Using the larger end will help you scoop more melon flesh quickly, resulting in reduced time spent on preparing the melon. Disadvantages: 1. Less melon balls overall: As you are creating larger melon balls, you will have fewer melon balls in total, which could be a downside if you prefer having a greater number of individual pieces. 2. Increased waste: The larger end may not fit as well into smaller sections of the melon, possibly leaving more flesh on the rind after scooping. This could lead to more waste if you cannot effectively remove the remaining melon flesh with a smaller melon baller, knife, or other kitchen utensil. Option B: Use the smaller end of the melon baller Advantages: 1. More melon balls overall: Using the smaller end of the melon baller will create a greater number of melon balls, which could be useful if you need to serve a larger group of people or prefer smaller bites. 2. Reduced waste: Smaller melon balls allow for better scooping in the curves and irregular sections of the melon, resulting in more efficient use of the flesh and less waste. Disadvantages: 1. Smaller melon balls: The smaller end creates smaller melon balls, which might not be as visually appealing or enjoyable to eat in comparison to the larger melon balls. This could be a downside if you're aiming to create a visually appealing fruit salad, for example. 2. Slower scooping: Since you are creating smaller melon balls, it may take more time to scoop out the entire melon. In conclusion, if you prioritize having larger, more visually appealing melon balls and value reduced preparation time, using the larger end of the melon baller (Option A) might make more sense for you. However, if your goal is to have a greater number of melon balls, minimize waste, and better utilize the entire melon, then using the smaller end of the melon baller (Option B) would be the better choice. It's essential to consider which factors are the most important to you based on factors such as personal preference, the specific use or presentation of the melon balls, or the size of your melon, in order to make the most suitable decision for your needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarizing signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.

The goal of the tax was to generate additional revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit. This tax was levied on material goods such as watches, expensive furs, boats, yachts, private jet planes, jewelry and expensive cars. Congress enacted a 10 percent luxury surcharge tax on boats over 100,000, cars over 30,000, aircraft over 250,000, and furs and jewelry over 10,000. The federal government estimated that it would raise 9 billion in excess revenues over the following five-year period. However, only two years after its imposition, in August 1993, the Congress decided to eliminate the \`\`luxury tax'' since it did not achieve its main objective. It is noteworthy that it \`\`failed'' by only raising 8.9 billion--that is, it fell 97 million short of its projected revenue. According to the tax's critics, these revenues were disappointing and unsatisfactory and also negatively impacted the incomes of the sellers of the luxury items. However, the luxury automobile tax remained in effect until 2002. is there a luxury tax in the united states?","output":"As of now, there is no specific luxury tax in the United States similar to the one enacted in 1991. However, that does not mean luxury items are completely free from additional taxes or fees. Instead, federal, state, and local governments may levy different taxes and fees that could apply to luxury items. For example, some states may have higher sales taxes for specific luxury goods like vehicles or luxury real estate property taxes. The original luxury tax of 1991 was ultimately repealed due to its negative and unintended consequences on the industries it targeted, like the aforementioned yacht and luxury car industry. The tax led to decreased demand for these items, causing job losses and lower-than-expected revenue generation. As previously mentioned, the luxury automobile tax remained in effect until 2002, when it was phased out. Presently, taxation in the United States focuses mainly on income, sales, property, and corporate taxes. High-income individuals may face higher tax brackets and capital gains taxes when they earn above certain thresholds. But a specific luxury tax on items like yachts, jewelry, and furs does not currently exist in the United States. It is worth noting that the concept of a luxury tax still exists in the realm of professional sports, such as the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB). These leagues impose a luxury tax to control team spending on player salaries and promote competitive balance within the leagues. However, this form of luxury tax is not imposed by the government and applies only to specific sports organizations."},{"instruction":"Question: What are the last names of the two men in love with Kit?

Person D is lying A:","output":"Person C most likely believes that Person D is lying (Option D). In the conversation, Person C expresses their conviction that Person D still has their Kindle and has not returned it, as promised. Person C even says, \\"You’re just trying to keep my Kindle for yourself,\\" which implies a belief that Person D is being dishonest about the situation. The conversation between Person A and Person B is an unrelated discussion about the location where Person B's mother grew up, which does not provide any context or insight into the problem between Person C and Person D. Involving parents in the conflict between Person C and Person D may or may not be helpful. It would depend on various factors, such as the parents' level of involvement in their children's lives, their ability to settle disputes, and their knowledge about the situation. In some cases, parents could provide a reasonable perspective and help resolve the issue, while in other cases, involving them might escalate the situation or be ineffective in finding a solution. It is essential for both parties to communicate and try to understand each other's perspective while working towards a resolution. If Person C believes that Person D is lying about returning the Kindle, they should have an open and honest discussion to clarify the misunderstanding and find a satisfactory solution. If necessary, mediation from a neutral party, such as a close friend or family member, could be helpful in resolving the conflict. However, it's important to consider the dynamics and relationships involved before involving any additional parties."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Apple has become... (Associated Press)      SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple has become the world's first publicly traded company to be valued at 1 trillion.      The milestone marks the triumph of stylish technology that has redefined what we expect from our gadgets ever since two mavericks named Steve started the company 42 years ago.      The peak reached Thursday seemed unimaginable in 1997 when Apple teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, with its stock trading for less than 1.      To survive, Apple brought back its once-exiled co-founder, Steve Jobs, as interim CEO and turned to its archrival Microsoft for a 150 million cash infusion to help pay its bills.      Jobs eventually introduced popular products such as the iPod and iPhone that subsequently drove Apple's rise. The stock has been surging this week as anticipation mounts for the next generation of iPhone, expected to be released in September.      Apple hit the 1 trillion mark when its shares reached an all-time high of 207.05 around midday in New York. The shares are up 22 percent so far this year.      Jobs' vision, showmanship and sense of style propelled Apple's comeback. But it might not have happened if he hadn't evolved into a more mature leader after his exit from the company in 1985. His ignominious departure came after losing a power struggle with John Sculley, a former Pepsico executive who he recruited to become Apple's CEO in 1983 — seven years after he and his geeky friend Steve Wozniak teamed up to start the company with the administrative help of Ronald Wayne.      Jobs remained mercurial when he returned to Apple, but he had also become more thoughtful and adept at spotting talent that would help him create a revolutionary innovation factory. One of his biggest coups came in 1998 when he lured a soft-spoken Southerner, Tim Cook, away from Compaq Computer at a time when Apple's survival remained in doubt.      Cook's hiring may have been one of the best things Jobs did for Apple. In addition, that is, to shepherding a decade-long succession of iconic products that transformed Apple from a technological boutique to a cultural phenomenon and moneymaking machine. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In 1976, Apple was started by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. They made computers and cool gadgets, like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Tim Cook became the boss after Steve Jobs passed away. Over time, lots of people started buying Apple's stuff, and the company became very valuable.

The mother, Gladys Perry (Jennifer Griffin), explains that their religious beliefs put them on a higher plane where such activities are forbidden. Just then the doorbell rings and some children outside yell \\"trick or treat.\\" Gladys answers the door and explains they don't participate in the holiday because they are Jehovah's Witness.Meanwhile, Larry Billings, a prison guard, returns to the prison to get some paperwork to do at home even as the two prisoners in their cells (Butch and Terry) consult with an elderly inmate regarding where the vents go. Once Butch and Terry break through the vents, and it is clear that an escape is underway, Butch tells Terry that they will separate when they get free and reach the state line because he doesn't like Terry. And Terry agrees with that plan as their hatred for each other coalesces. Butch and Terry get past the guard at the gate in Larry's car with Larry at the wheel. Once they reach town they commandeer Larry's car and search for a new escape car. Terry is sidetracked by Gladys making breakfast. Terry breaks into the kitchen holding a gun and terrorizes her, grabbing her around the neck for a smooch.

The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later.

Article: Self-employed private physicians who charge a fee for each patient visit are the foundation of medical practice in the United States. Most physicians have a contract relationship with one or more hospitals in the community. They send their patients to this hospital, which usually charges patients according to the number of days they stay and the facilities(operating room, tests, medicines that they use). Some hospitals belong to a city, a state or, in the case of veteran's hospitals, a federal government agency. Others are operated by religious orders  or other non-profit groups. Some medical doctors are on salary. Salaried physicians may work as hospital staff members, or residents, who are often still in training. They may teach in medical schools, be hired by corporations to care for their workers or work for the federal government's Public Health Service. Physicians are among the best paid professionals in the United States. In the 1980s, it was not uncommon for medical doctors to earn incomes of more than  100 000 a year. Specialists, particularly surgeons, might earn several times that amount. Physicians list many reasons why they deserve to be so well rewarded for their work. One reason is the long and expensive preparation required to become a physician in the United States. Most would be physicians first attend college for four years, which can cost nearly  20 000 a year at one of the best private institutions. Prospective physicians then attend medical school for four years. Tuition alone can exceed  10 000 a year.

They still face three to five years of residency  in a hospital, the first year as an apprentice physician. The hours are long and the pay is relatively low.

The Prime Minister said the next election would be a 'straight fight' between Labour and the Tories, and a vote for UKIP made it more likely that Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister in 2015. The jibe came just hours before former Tory donor Arron Banks announced he was handing £1million to UKIP, in protest at being dismissed as a 'nobody' by senior Conservative William Hague. Scroll down for video David Cameron warned that a vote for UKIP would make it easier for Labour to win the next election The joke was captured in this photograph of the autocue, after Mr OPTIONS: - Arron Banks rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - David Cameron rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Ed Miliband rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Labour rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Miliband rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Nigel Farage rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Tories rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - Tory rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - UKIP rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory - William Hague rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory","output":"The sentence ends with: David Cameron rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory. In this case, David Cameron, the Prime Minister at the time, was using the opportunity to emphasize the contrasting approaches between his party, the Conservatives, and Ed Miliband's Labour Party. By rejecting the idea of delivering the speech from memory, as Ed Miliband had done previously, he sought to convey that he was confident in his message and strategy. Furthermore, this statement could be seen as an attempt by Cameron to further discredit UKIP by asserting that voting for them would ultimately be a self-defeating act for voters, as it would actually increase the likelihood of a Labour victory, something UKIP voters were presumably not in favor of. The implication of this warning is that tactical voting should be employed by the electorate and they should strategically vote for the Conservatives, the main rivals to the Labour Party, if they wished to prevent the latter from coming into power. Cameron's comment references Ed Miliband, the former leader of the Labour Party, to make a point about the consequences of voting for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in the upcoming election. This was meant to suggest that although some voters might be attracted to the idea of supporting UKIP due to their hardline stances on various issues, such as immigration and the European Union, doing so would weaken the Conservative Party's chances of winning the election and inadvertently aid Miliband and the Labour Party. Concerning the announcement by Arron Banks, a former Tory donor, that he would be donating £1 million to UKIP, symbolizes a further challenge to the Conservative Party. This suggests that some individuals who had previously been associated with the Tories believed that UKIP could provide a more suitable political alternative. This was a cause for concern for David Cameron, particularly given that he was already attempting to fend off UKIP's growing electoral appeal. Overall, David Cameron's statement, captured on the autocue, serves as both a warning to potential UKIP voters and an attempt to discourage defections from his party, by stressing the potential unintended consequences of supporting UKIP in the upcoming election."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Authorities say Scott died after jumping off a bridge in Los Angeles on Sunday, Aug.... (Associated Press)      The 68-year-old Scott's death was being investigated as a suicide, Los Angeles County Coroner's Lt. Joe Bale said.      \\"I can confirm that Tony Scott has passed away. The family asks that their privacy is respected at this time,\\" Scott's spokesman, Simon Halls, said in a statement.      An autopsy is scheduled for Monday, coroner's Chief of Operations Craig Harvey said. He said investigators located several notes to loved ones that Scott left in his car and at another location, but that they were not described in initial reports as suicide notes.      He said Scott parked his car at the crest of the bridge, which is 185 feet above water, before leaping to his death.      Several people called police around 12:35 p.m. to report that someone had jumped from the Vincent Thomas Bridge spanning San Pedro and Terminal Island in Los Angeles Harbor, according to police Lt. Tim Nordquist.      A dive team with Los Angeles Port Police pulled the body from the murky water several hours later, Nordquist said. Scott's body was taken to a dock in Wilmington and turned over to the county coroner's office.      One lane of the eastbound side of the bridge was closed to traffic during the investigation. Cargo vessels moved at reduced speeds through the east side of the port's main channel during the search, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey.      The British-born Scott, who lived in Beverly Hills, was producer and director Ridley Scott's younger brother. Distinct visual styles mark both siblings' films _ Ridley Scott mastering the creation of entire worlds with such films as \\"Gladiator,\\" \`'Blade Runner,\\" \`'Alien\\" and this year's \\"Prometheus,\\" Tony Scott known for hyper-kinetic action and editing on such films as his most recent, the runaway train thriller \\"Unstoppable,\\" starring regular collaborator Denzel Washington.      Scott was a thrill-seeker himself in his personal life, an avid rock climber who also liked driving fast cars and motorcycles. Still, filmmaking was his real thrill.      \\"The biggest edge I live on is directing. That's the most scary, dangerous thing you can do in your life,\\" Scott said in an interview for his 1995 naval adventure \\"Crimson Tide.\\" \`'The scariest thing in my life is the first morning of production on all my movies. It's the fear of failing, the loss of face and a sense of guilt that everybody puts their faith in you and not coming through.\\"      Tony was the first of the Scott brothers to enjoy blockbuster success with \\"Top Gun,\\" starring Tom Cruise, the top-grossing film of 1986 at 176 million. Scott teamed with Cruise again four years later on the hit \\"Days of Thunder.\\" He also had a sequel to \\"Top Gun\\" in development.      But Ridley Scott later managed more and bigger hits than his brother and earned a level of critical respect never achieved by Tony Scott. \\"Gladiator\\" won the best-picture Academy Award for 2000 and earned Ridley Scott one of his three best-director nominations; Tony Scott never was in the running for an Oscar, and critics often slammed his movies for emphasizing style over substance.      Even Scott admitted that it was a challenge to infuse drama into some of his scenarios _ for example, cars racing in circles in \\"Days of Thunder.\\" In an interview for that 1990 summer hit, Scott was blunt about where some of the ideas came from.      \\"I went back and I stole from all race movies to date,\\" Scott said. \\"I took the better elements, then tried to build on them. Really, the speed, the energy and the placement of the audience inside some of the cars came in the editing room ...      \\"I'm always pushing for something new and fresh in the way things are shot, and the rest happens in the editing room ... The real speed comes from the cutters and what they do with the celluloid.\\"      While Ridley Scott had an auspicious start to his film career with 1977's acclaimed period drama \\"The Duellists\\" and 1979's \\"Alien,\\" Tony Scott bombed with his debut, 1983's supernatural romance \\"The Hunger,\\" with David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve.      He vaulted into Hollywood's top ranks the next time out, with \\"Top Gun,\\" followed a year later by \\"Beverly Hills Cop II,\\" both with producer Jerry Bruckheimer.      The two brothers ran Scott Free Productions and were working jointly on a film called \\"Killing Lincoln,\\" based on the best seller by Bill O'Reilly. Along with countless commercials, their company produced the CBS dramas \\"NUMB3RS\\" and \\"The Good Wife\\" as well as a 2011 documentary about the Battle of Gettysburg for the History Channel.      Tony Scott said he gained perspective by mixing things up between film, TV and commercials. \\"I like changing the pace of my life, changing my discipline. It gives me ideas for how to see the world differently,\\" Scott said in a 2007 interview.      Besides \\"Unstoppable,\\" Scott worked with Washington on four other movies: \\"Crimson Tide,\\" \`'Man on Fire,\\" \`'Deja Vu\\" and \\"The Taking of Pelham 123.\\"      In a tweet Sunday, director Ron Howard said, \\"No more Tony Scott movies.

During the Leveson Inquiry, a stream of celebrities poured into the Royal Courts of Justice to talk about the iniquities of the Press. Star after star called for tighter regulation on newspapers, telling Lord Justice Leveson how the tabloids had hounded them, made their lives miserable and used every ‘dark art’ imaginable. But the phone hacking trial has lifted the veil on the other side of the relationship between celebrities and the tabloid Press – and it’s a side Lord Justice Leveson’s cast of famous faces was less eager to discuss. Scroll down for video. Close friends: Jude Law, far left, with Sienna Miller and Daniel Craig. The jury heard evidence about the alleged affair between Miller and Craig. Self-confessed phone hacker Dan Evans claimed he had uncovered the relationship when he hacked the 007 actor's voicemails. With combative lawyers prepared to scrutinise the evidence of witnesses, the trial revealed the underbelly of celebrity: how friends, family and even the famous themselves willingly sold stories to the News of the World for money, influence or to extend their own time in the spotlight. There were revelations about George Best’s son Calum, socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson and Eimear Cook, ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie. It emerged that former Home Secretary David Blunkett complained to a friend that ‘hyenas’ had betrayed him – little suspecting his friend was the one who had tipped off newspapers and would ultimately sell his voicemails to the highest bidder. And perhaps most dramatically of all, Hollywood star Jude Law was confronted in court with information that a close member of his own family had sold secrets about him. Visibly shaken, the actor said the unnamed male relative had admitted giving information to the newspaper but said he had not known the man had taken the tabloid’s money. The jury heard claims the actor had effectively approved a front page story revealing his former fiancée Sienna Miller’s affair with James Bond star Daniel Craig. Law denied he had sanctioned the 2005 article, but the court heard his publicist had asked the tabloid to ‘back-date’ Miss Miller’s affair with Craig so it would appear she cheated on Law before he was caught out in a fling with his children’s nanny. In a taped conversation with a journalist, Law’s publicist appeared to be speaking on his behalf when she said: ‘If you could definitely pre-date it so that she cheated first, that’s the thing he wants the most.’ Coulson, then editor of the News of. the World, was so confident the article had been signed off by Law that. he told sub-editors to avoid calling him a ‘love rat’ and emailed a. colleague saying: ‘This story is effectively from Jude.’ The affair between Miss Miller and. Craig was a key part of the prosecution case. Self-confessed phone. hacker Dan Evans claimed he had uncovered the relationship when he. hacked the 007 actor’s voicemails. But. Miss Miller’s own driver had apparently sold the story to the tabloid. for £6,000 after catching the actress at a secret rendezvous with Craig. There. is no dispute that phone hacking happened at the tabloid. Miss Miller,. for example, received £100,000 damages from Rupert Murdoch’s News Group. Newspapers. But lawyers at the trial set out to. show that journalists and newspapers relied on countless legitimate. sources to gather information. The judge told lawyers he was anxious the trial should not unravel into a ‘celebrity chat show’ dominated by star witnesses. Unlike the Leveson Inquiry – which faced. criticism that it gave celebrities a platform to make any complaint. about the Press they chose, seemingly without challenge – trial. witnesses had their evidence scrutinised to the standards of a criminal. trial. Former Head of News International Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie Brooks sit in a taxi as they leave the Old Bailey after being cleared yesterday. Brooks' deputy and later editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson was swept from court after being found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones. Among the startling revelations:. CALUM BEST. The son of footballer George Best admitted he had ‘actively encouraged’ some media intrusion into his personal life. The 33-year-old pocketed £2,000 from the News of the World for the story of his own sordid nightclub tryst with Mick Jagger’s daughter Elizabeth. Calum Best pocketed £2,000 from the. News of the World for the story of his own nightclub tryst with. Mick Jagger’s daughter Elizabeth. He also passed on stories about his friends. Mr Justice Saunders said: ‘Calum Best is a full-time “celebrity”. He needs publicity in order to remain a full-time “celebrity”. He sometimes supplies information to the Press himself.’ TARA PALMER-TOMKINSON. Prince Charles’ goddaughter was revealed as one of the News of the World’s sources for information about the Royal Family. Tara-Palmer Tomkinson was revealed as one of the News of the World's sources for information about the Royal Family. Former royal editor Clive Goodman ‘outed’ her as the source for its story about Prince William’s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle being gatecrashed by ‘comedy terrorist’ Aaron Barschak in 2003. Then Andy Coulson confirmed the newspaper had paid a ‘female’ source for this story – and other royal scoops – although he did not name Miss Palmer-Tomkinson. SIENNA MILLER. Miss Miller - hailed as a 'hacking heroine' when she took civil action against the News of the World and gave evidence to Leveson - used her time as a witness to complain once again about media coverage. Miss Miller – hailed as a ‘hacking heroine’ when she took civil action against the News of the World and gave evidence to Leveson – used her time as a witness to complain once again about media coverage of the evidence surrounding her ‘very brief encounter’ with Daniel Craig. ‘This is a really difficult and uncomfortable part of my life to discuss, seeing as it’s been allowed out of the courtroom and into the hands of the world’s media to be gossiped [over] and analysed, and me vilified for it,’ she said. It’s been turned into this titillating piece of information. I really regret that it has been allowed to be analysed in the way that it has.’ Trial judge Mr Justice Saunders said he was sorry if coverage had upset Miss Miller but assured her the evidence had been necessary. He did not say – but some in the courtroom could be forgiven for thinking – that the actress’ hurt feelings were not his priority in a complex trial in which seven people’s reputations and liberty hung in the balance. EIMEAR COOK. Eimear Cook, ex wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie, also gave evidence to the court. The ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie denied claims she had told Brooks about a ‘violent event’ during her 14-year marriage in the hope Brooks would expose her ex-husband in the Sun. Mrs Cook, who accepted a payout from the News of the World for phone hacking, denied she had invented her evidence to boost her  civil claim for aggravated damages. She was accused of telling a ‘bare-face lie’ in her evidence, when she claimed Brooks had told her it was ‘easy’ to hack phones. Mrs Cook, 43, said Brooks told her about phone hacking at a meeting in 2005 in which the then Sun editor had also laughed about her own arrest for an alleged assault on her then husband, EastEnders actor Ross Kemp. Mrs Cook was accused of lying when it emerged that Brooks’ arrest did not take place until several weeks after the meeting.

A. making babies  B. bliss  C. unwanted pregnancy  D. aids  E. orgasm  The best answer is Answer:","output":"D. aids Twenty years ago, during the late 1990s and early 2000s, having sex as a gay man was often associated with a higher risk of contracting the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which could lead to the development of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). This was primarily due to the nature of HIV transmission, the high rates of infection among men who have sex with men (MSM), and the stigma surrounding homosexuality at that time. Although HIV can affect anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, it disproportionately impacted the gay community during this period. The primary mode of transmission for HIV is through sexual contact — particularly, anal intercourse, which carries a higher risk compared to other forms of sexual activity. While all the answers provided could potentially be outcomes of sexual activity for gay men (with the exception of C, unwanted pregnancy), the prevalence of HIV and AIDS within the gay community at that time made it the best answer for this question. Back then, HIV testing and awareness were not as widespread as they are today. A lack of understanding about the virus and how it was transmitted contributed to the rapid spread of the infection within the gay community. Stigma and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ individuals also made it difficult for those at risk or living with HIV to access appropriate healthcare, counseling, and support, further fueling the epidemic. It's important to note that while HIV and AIDS were more commonly associated with having sex as a gay man twenty years ago, significant advancements have since been made in prevention, testing, and treatment. Access to reliable information, the development of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) — a medication taken daily to prevent HIV infection, campaigns promoting the use of condoms, and the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for those living with HIV have all contributed to a significant decline in the number of new infections and HIV-related deaths. Furthermore, increased advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights and a growing acceptance of various sexual orientations in many societies have helped break down the barriers that prevented those at risk from seeking the care and support they need. In conclusion, twenty years ago, having sex as a gay man often led to a higher risk of contracting HIV, which could develop into AIDS. The combination of high infection rates within the gay community, transmission methods, and the social stigma surrounding homosexuality all contributed to the prominence of this outcome. However, the landscape has significantly changed in terms of HIV prevention, treatment, and societal acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, leading to a more optimistic outlook for those engaging in same-sex relationships today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It had been previously known as the Erlachhof, a traditional hunting estate and lodge of the Dukes of Württemberg that was destroyed in 1692, during the Nine Years' War. Eberhard Louis commissioned a replacement lodge that was built from 1697 to 1701. Construction was interrupted by the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession, fought against France and Bavaria. Württemberg resisted entry into the war until late 1702. Two years later, Eberhard Louis participated in the Battle of Blenheim in August 1704 that was followed by the exile of the Bavarian Elector. The duke used the battle to press claims to Bavarian lands, but he illegally occupied those lands and was further weakened by a French invasion of Württemberg in 1707. As a result of this attack, the ducal residence in the capital, Stuttgart, was burned and the royal family fled to Switzerland. With the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the occupied Bavarian territory and status of the exiled Elector were restored.Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace began in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau's cornerstone by Eberhard Louis. The year before, he sent Philipp Joseph Jenisch to study architecture abroad. Eberhard Louis made Jenisch director of construction upon his return the next year, but he only managed to finish the Alter Hauptbau's (Old main building) first floor and some of the southern garden before 1707. The duke spent the winter of 1705–06 at Nymphenburg Palace, residence of the Elector of Bavaria, and was impressed by what he saw there and in architectural publications. Unable to compete with Bavaria militarily or politically, and defiant following the loss of the Stuttgart residence, Eberhard Louis decided to follow the example of Bavaria, Baden-Durlach, and the Rhineland Palatinate. He elected to build a new palace and town inspired by Versailles, which would be the center of his domestic society and diplomacy. Located 10..., what would be the answer ?

While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames, allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Steve Gillan, of the Prison Officers Association, said proper staff levels were needed if officers - not inmates - were to be in charge of jails. Earlier, he held talks with Justice Secretary Liz Truss over the rise in violence and suicides in prisons. Ms Truss is set to unveil what she is calling the biggest overhaul of prisons in a generation on Thursday. Mr Gillan said he wanted her reform plans to include prisoner searches as well as greater investment, saying Â£900m had been taken out of the service since 2010. \\"We are not accepting any crumbs from the table,\\" he said. He added that Ms Truss appeared to accept the prison service was in crisis, underfunded and short-staffed, and warned the POA and government would be \\"on a collision course\\" if these problems were not addressed. \\"The last thing that we want to see is more carnage and bloodbaths, and a prison officer loses his life,\\" he said, after the meeting. Are prisons becoming more dangerous places? Earlier on Wednesday, the POA, which is banned from taking industrial action, had been set to take part in an unofficial walkout. The union has set a deadline of 11 November for government to take action over prison violence, otherwise it is threatening to resume its plan of public meetings and taking control of prisons from managers. Latest figures show a new high of 65 assaults in jails every day. In the year to June, assaults on staff jumped by 43% to 5,954, with 697 of these recorded as serious. For months there has been huge concern about conditions in prisons, escalating levels of violence, self-harm and suicide. The fatal stabbing of a prisoner at Pentonville Prison, north London, propelled the issue into the headlines. Prison officers are concerned they cannot safely operate in jails with the current levels of staff. The POA wanted to hold a series of union meetings outside prison gates - visible to the public and the media - before imposing their own working practices, including letting inmates out of their cells only in small numbers. That would be a highly-restricted kind of regime. The government agreed, as part of a deal for that action to be suspended, to hold urgent talks. On Thursday, when Ms Truss is due to announce prison reforms, she is likely to continue steps taken by former Justice Secretary Michael Gove - giving governors more control and changing the way education is provided in prison. But she also has to say something about recruitment and retention of prison officers. She has already announced 400 extra staff, but the problem is in some areas it doesn't pay to be a prison officer. That's something the government's got to seriously look at, whether it involves extra pay incentives early on in someone's career or quicker pay progression. One prisoner at London's Pentonville Prison told the BBC, via a note, how he had witnessed the \\"gory\\" killing of 21-year-old Jamal Mahmoud last month. Since the incident, he said, prisoners had been \\"on lockdown\\". \\"What really worries me is the availability of weapons and the frequency and severity of the violence I have witnessed here,\\" he said. He described how razors melted into toothbrushes were fashioned into weapons and flex and plugs from in-cell kettles were used as a \\"garrotte\\" or \\"flailing\\" weapons. He also said knives were flown into Pentonville by drones. Meanwhile, a former offender told BBC's World at One about stabbings, assaults and gang violence happening almost daily at his prison. Lord Ramsbotham, former chief inspector of prisons and prison reform campaigner, said the problems were \\"not surprising\\" after the government had cut staff by a third. The fact that both officers and governors were calling for urgent action should be taken \\"very seriously\\" by the government, he told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. \\"The basis of all prisons is the relationship between staff and prisoners. Unless things are right for staff, nothing will be right for prisoners,\\" he said. He called on the government to make people publicly responsible and accountable for prisons, as they were for business, schools and hospitals; to address overcrowding; and to make sure governors led their staff. What was that article about?","output":"This article is addressing how prisons are becoming more dangerous places.

It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein at the corner of Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: \\"He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage.

Most album covers were carefully staged and controlled, to terrific effect on the Blue Note jazz album covers ... and to not-so great-effect on the perfectly posed and clean-cut pop and folk albums.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  Which would be a better day for group B to attack group A, battle day one or battle day two?  Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. A:","output":"Based on the information provided and the hint, it is important to note that Acromyrmex heyeri ants adjust the openings in their nest thatch in response to temperature and humidity. They create more openings when the temperature is between 20-30 °C and close the openings when the air humidity decreases. On battle day one, the temperature in group A territory is 5 °C, which is significantly lower than the optimal range of 20-30 °C. As a result, it is likely that the ants will have fewer openings in their nest thatch to conserve warmth and better regulate the internal temperature of their colony. This implies that attacking group A on battle day one might be more challenging for group B since the defenses of the colony will be relatively high due to fewer openings. On battle day two, the temperature in group A territory is 22 °C, which falls within the optimal range of 20-30 °C for the creation of more nest thatch openings. This means that group A ants will likely have more openings in their nest thatch on battle day two for temperature regulation purposes. The increased number of openings would present a higher vulnerability for group A's colony, making it an opportune time for group B to attack. Although humidity also plays a role in the ants' decision to open or close nest thatch openings, the temperature factor seems to have a more significant impact based on the provided information. With this in mind, it would be better for group B to attack group A on battle day two when the temperature is 22 °C, as this falls within the optimal range for having more openings in the nest thatch, consequently making the colony more susceptible to attack."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.

It is the largest high school science competition in the world. The Maryland teenager is the youngest winner of the 75,000 prize. He was chosen from among 1,500 students in 70 countries. Jack Andraka invented a test for pancreatic cancer  . He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. \\"I went on the Internet and I found that 85%of all pancreatic cancers are found late, when someone has less than 2% chance of survival , \\" he says, \\"and I was thinking,' That's not right. We should be able to do something.'\\" He found that early discovery is important to increasing the chances of surviving the disease. The Maryland teenager asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test, which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His test has proved correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. \\"It costs 3 cents per test, and then it takes only 5 minutes to run,\\" he said. Jack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra, a professor at Johns Hopkins. He was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to who showed interest in his project. \\"I was very surprised that this was a 15-year-old who was writing this.

Premise: \\"It seems to me in America, where we rejoice in the fact that we are a nation devoted to the rule of law, we should not ration access to justice.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"In America, justice should only be for the upper class.\\"?","output":"If we assume the premise to be true, that in America the nation prides itself on being devoted to the rule of law and should not ration access to justice, it would be contradictory to the given hypothesis \\"In America, justice should only be for the upper class.\\" Let's analyze this in greater detail. The premise highlights some important ideas about the American legal system:  1. Devotion to the rule of law: The rule of law is a central principle in the American legal system, which posits that every individual, regardless of their status or power, should be held equally accountable under the law. It emphasizes impartiality, fairness, and equality, asserting that no one is above the law. 2. No rationing of access to justice: Rationing implies that a resource or service should be selectively distributed, often based on specific criteria such as socioeconomic status or other factors. The premise suggests that the American legal system should not allow for any such rationing when it comes to accessing justice, implying that everyone should have an equal opportunity to seek justice, irrespective of their backgrounds. Now, let's consider the hypothesis \\"In America, justice should only be for the upper class.\\" This statement directly contradicts the two main ideas of the premise: 1. Equality under the law: By suggesting that justice should only be for the upper class, this hypothesis implies that there is a distinction between the upper class and the rest of the population in terms of how the law should be applied or enforced. This contradicts the idea that everyone should be treated equally under the law. 2. Rationing of justice: If justice were only to be accessible to the upper class, as the hypothesis suggests, it would mean that justice is being rationed based on socioeconomic status - which is in direct opposition to the idea mentioned in the premise that there should be no rationing of access to justice. From this analysis, it becomes evident that if we accept the premise as true, it cannot logically entail the given hypothesis. In fact, the premise refutes the hypothesis by emphasizing the importance of treating everyone equally under the law and ensuring that access to justice is not rationed based on factors like class or socioeconomic status. Therefore, if we maintain the premise to be true, it leads to the conclusion that, in America, justice should not be exclusive to the upper class but rather be accessible to all citizens, upholding the core principle of equality under the law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Johnny Depp sued his former business managers Friday alleging they mismanaged his earnings throughout a lucrative period of his career, although the company says the actor's spending is to blame. Depp's lawsuit filed against The Management Group seeks more than 25 million, reports the AP, alleging it failed to properly pay his taxes, made unauthorized loans, and overpaid for security. Michael J. Kump, an attorney for The Management Group, calls Depp's lawsuit a \\"fabrication.\\" The company \\"did everything possible to protect Depp from his irresponsible and profligate spending,\\" Kump wrote. Depp's suit accuses the company and its owners, attorneys Joel and Robert Mandel, of receiving 28 million in payments for services over 16 years. The company \\"actively concealed the true state of Mr. Depp's finances while driving him deeper and deeper into financial distress,\\" the suit states. Depp hired the Mandels in 1999 and they received 5% of his income on hit films such as the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Alice in Wonderland, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The lawsuit alleges the company failed to file Depp's tax returns on time, costing him nearly 5.7 million in penalties. The lawsuit also alleges the company overpaid for several services, including forgetting to terminate the lease on a home where Depp's mother lived temporarily, and spending 8 million on security between 2012 and 2015 alone. Depp learned of the problems after hiring new management in March 2016. Kump wrote that Depp owes The Management Group 4.2 million from a 5 million loan. \\"His tactics and lawsuit will fail, and he will be forced to pay back the loan as promised,\\" Kump wrote. The suit came the same day Depp finalized his divorce from Amber Heard, which calls for Depp to pay 7 million in installments. Heard gets to keep the couple's dogs, notes the BBC, Pistol and Boo.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the descendant of Robert Campbell? , can you please find it?   The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia. Soon afterwards... Answer:","output":"The first name of the descendant of Robert Campbell who purchased Yarralumla in 1881 is Frederick. Frederick Campbell bought the estate for 40,000 pounds from Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes and later erected a new three-storey brick house on the site, which now serves as the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: This article: English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat.

Question: \\"What kind of contrast is seen in hard pines?\\"  Context: \\"If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In hard pines, on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In hard pines, the contrast seen relates to the distinct differences between the earlywood and the latewood in terms of their density, color, and textural properties. This contrast arises from the growth patterns and the way wood is formed in these species, leading to significant variations in their physical characteristics. Earlywood refers to the portion of the growth ring developed at the beginning of the growing season. It typically consists of larger, thin-walled cells that give the wood a lighter, softer, and more pliable texture. In hard pines, earlywood appears straw-colored, providing a visual distinction from the darker latewood. Latewood, on the other hand, is formed during the latter part of the growing season when the tree's growth slows down. It consists of smaller, thicker-walled cells resulting in a denser and stronger material. In hard pines, the latewood is characterized by its deep coloration and significantly higher density compared to the earlywood. The presence of a large proportion of latewood in hard pines also gives them more clearly demarcated growth rings, as indicated in the context provided. The contrast observed in hard pines plays a crucial role in determining their overall physical and mechanical properties, making them suitable for diverse applications. The dense and strong latewood contributes to their durability and structural stability, while the softer earlywood allows for some flexibility. This combination has significant implications on the workability of the wood, as the varied texture can pose challenges in processing and utilization. In comparison, white pines, with their less contrasted growth rings and more uniform texture, are easier to work with and often employed in applications requiring fine woodworking and detailed carving. However, they may not offer the same load-bearing capacity or resilience as hard pines do. In conclusion, the contrast seen in hard pines stems from the distinct differences in the earlywood and latewood within their growth rings. This contrast is characterized by variations in density, color, and texture, which significantly impact the wood's physical properties and its applications in various industries. While hard pines offer a combination of strength and flexibility owing to their contrasting growth patterns, this also presents additional challenges in terms of workability compared to species with a more uniform texture, such as white pines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"what unit of time can be estimated by the rings in a tree trunk?\\" is years. Tree rings, also known as growth rings or annual rings, are an essential tool for scientists and researchers in determining the age of trees, as well as understanding the climate and other environmental conditions. Each ring represents one complete year of growth for the tree. Examining the thickness and appearance of each ring can provide valuable information about the specific conditions present during that year of growth. Here's a brief explanation of why the other choices are not correct: - Hours: The growth of trees is not measured in hours as it is relatively insignificant in terms of time, and it would not be visible or meaningful within a tree's trunk. - Decades: While it is true that tree rings can age a tree and estimate the passage of decades, the rings are formed annually, making them a more accurate representation of years. - Months: Trees' growth rates change throughout the year because of external factors like temperature and precipitation. Tree rings are the accumulation of growth for an entire year, not monthly growth intervals. - H20: H2O represents water, which is not a unit of time at all. - Joules: Joules are a unit of energy, not time. - DNA: DNA plays a role in tree growth, but it is not a unit of time. Instead, it is a molecule containing genetic information. - Seasons: Although changes in the seasons do impact tree growth, rings develop annually rather than seasonally. Given the scientific evidence and comparison to the other answer choices, it is clear that the number of rings in a tree trunk represents the measurement of time in years."},{"instruction":"Aubrey filled Riley's tank with fuel to have a fun drive on the highway.

The transition to a new home is stressful for a cockatiel, and your bird will need time to rest and get acclimated.  Try to let the bird rest for 2-3 days before handling it. Try to keep children and other household pets away from the bird, but do talk to it frequently in a low, calming voice to help it get used to you. Remember that cockatiels are very social animals.  You might leave music or the television on when you leave the house during the day so the cockatiel has something to listen to. You should spend some time researching the best ways to train a cockatiel, but a great place to start is teaching the bird to be near you outside of the cage.  Gently remove the bird from the cage and take it to a small room with a door, like a bathroom or large closet. Close the door so the bird does not escape, and let the bird go. Then sit near the bird and talk to it every once in a while as it adjusts to your presence. Eventually, you can work on training the bird to climb onto your finger. Training a cockatiel can take time, but your patience will pay be rewarded with a well-socialized, friendly companion. Cockatiels can be very dusty birds and need to be bathed every few days.

What is a summary of this text?","output":"This extensive text covers the history of Cuba from 1492 up until 2017. Here's a very basic summary: 1. 1492: Columbus arrives. Spanish colonization begins in 1511 and progresses alongside the importation of slaves from Africa. 2. Late 19th century: Wars and US involvement lead to Cuba's independence in 1902, producing a period of political instability and socioeconomic changes. 3. Mid-20th century: Fidel Castro leads a successful revolution which establishes a communist government. As part of the Cold War, Cuba gets into a well-known conflict with the US, leading to a US embargo on Cuba. 4. Late 20th century: After the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba experiences economic hardship but also begins some reforms. 5. Early 21st century: Fidel Castro falls ill and hands over power to his brother Raul, who starts further reforms. In very recent years, diplomatic relationships with the US began to improve after a long freeze, but some tension still remains. Throughout all of these stages, we see Cuba's interactions with various international forces such as Spain, the US, the Soviet Union, and other Latin American countries, reflecting the island's strategic importance and the influence of its political and economic systems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Be clean, wear comfortable and well maintained clothes, and always remember to smile. Smiling can automatically make you more relatable and radiant. Make sure to brush your teeth or use mouthwash. Bad breath is a real turnoff. There is nothing quite so helpful as rehearsal; preparing your mind helps you to feel familiar with the situation. And when you have a speech prepared, it will go a lot better. If you don't practice you may blurt out: 'ummm er wanna...go out...with, umm...let's date' or something silly like that. Keep practicing until it feels natural, or at least okay.

Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress.  But I can use this background: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.  What is an answer for this question: Which region had fewer species inhabiting it? The answer is:","output":"The Northern region of Italy had fewer species inhabiting it. The relationship between abiotic stress and biodiversity is crucial when understanding why one region would have fewer species inhabiting it than another. Abiotic stress refers to the negative impacts caused by non-biological, or abiotic, factors in an environment. These can include extreme temperatures, water scarcity, soil nutrient limitations, and other physical and chemical factors that can make an environment more challenging for organisms to thrive in. In the given scenario, the Northern region of Italy experiences a significant amount of abiotic stress. As a result, the biodiversity in this area is affected negatively. High levels of abiotic stress act as selective pressures on species, often allowing only the most resilient and adaptable organisms to persist. This leads to a reduced number of species in the region, as less hardy organisms struggle to survive and reproduce in the face of these environmental challenges. Conversely, the Southern region of Italy experiences minimal abiotic stress. In this scenario, the environment is more hospitable and conducive to the growth and reproduction of various species. Such conditions support a greater level of biodiversity because multiple organisms with diverse characteristics are able to prosper in the area. This means that there will be a larger number of species inhabiting the Southern region compared to the Northern region, where abiotic stress is more prevalent. Moreover, the presence of abiotic stress can also contribute to a higher number of endangered species in the affected region. As species face challenges in their environment, their populations may decline to the point where they become vulnerable to extinction. Consequently, the Northern region of Italy would not only have fewer species but also a higher likelihood of harboring endangered or threatened species. To summarize, the Northern region of Italy had fewer species inhabiting it due to the higher levels of abiotic stress experienced in this area. In contrast, the Southern region's lower levels of abiotic stress allowed it to support a greater variety of species, resulting in higher biodiversity. This relationship between abiotic stress and species diversity highlights the importance of understanding the environmental factors that contribute to the well-being of ecosystems and their various inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stir in the remaining lukewarm water.","output":"Now that we have our ingredients ready, let's continue making crumpets! 1. Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture, and mix them together with a wooden spoon until they form a smooth batter. The batter should be thick, but not too stiff. If it's too thick, add a little more water. 2. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let the batter rest in a warm place for about 1 hour. This is to let the yeast do its magic and make the batter rise and become bubbly. 3. After the resting time, gently stir the batter to get rid of extra air bubbles. Then mix in the baking soda and a pinch of salt. This will help the crumpets become fluffier and taste better. 4. Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over low heat. Lightly grease some round metal molds (like cookie cutters) and the pan. You can also use a special crumpet ring or even an empty and clean tuna can with the top and bottom removed. 5. Place the molds onto the pan and fill each one about ½ full with the batter. Let the crumpets cook for about 4 to 5 minutes, until the top surface is covered with little holes and the edges look set. 6. Carefully remove the molds using tongs. Flip the crumpets over and cook them for another 3 to 4 minutes on the other side, until they are golden brown. 7. Remove the crumpets from the pan, and let them cool on a wire rack. Repeat the process with the remaining batter. Yay! Now, you have delicious homemade crumpets! You can eat them with your favorite toppings like butter, jam, or honey, and enjoy your tasty treat.

By Associated Press and Helen Pow PUBLISHED: 19:12 EST, 11 April 2013 | UPDATED: 19:30 EST, 11 April 2013 Desperate man: Lauren Brown, 55, a former consultant for IBM, has been identified as the slain suspect who held four firefighters hostage for hours in his suburban Atlanta home A gunman who lured firefighters to his Georgia home with an emergency call, then held four of them hostage for hours before being shot to death was identified Thursday as a down-on-his-luck IBM consultant. Lauren Brown's life apparently reached a crisis this spring. With his power, cable and other utilities cut off because of nonpayment, the 55-year-old had half a dozen guns in his house and spent weeks planning the kidnapping, targeting firefighters rather than police Wednesday so he wouldn't be shot, authorities said. Ambulance: An EMT works in the back of an ambulance as it leaves an Suwanee,","output":"Georgia neighborhood where the hostage situation took place. The incident began when Brown made a 911 call, reporting a heart attack and pretending to be in severe distress. Firefighters from Station 10 in Gwinnett County quickly responded to the call, completely unaware that they were walking into a dangerous and unanticipated situation. Upon arrival, the firefighters were taken hostage by Brown, who demanded that his utility services be restored. According to investigators, Brown had lost his job at IBM and was struggling financially, unable to pay his bills and rapidly spiraling into an unstable state. The ordeal not only highlights Brown's personal tragedy but also reveals a concerning trend of increasing desperation among many Americans in the face of economic hardship. Neighbors, who had grown increasingly worried about Brown's erratic behavior, recall seeing a steady downturn in his life in recent months. Some described him as a once-friendly man who gradually became isolated and distressed. As his situation worsened, Brown's mental health seemed to deteriorate, and his focus shifted to finding a way to reverse the course of his life. Gwinnett County Sheriff Butch Conway spoke to reporters during a press conference Thursday, giving a detailed account of the tragic incident and the coordinated efforts of law enforcement and the fire department to resolve it. According to Conway, a SWAT team was deployed to the scene in an attempt to negotiate with Brown and secure the release of the hostages. Standoff: Police officers and firemen worked together in a joint task force to handle the potentially deadly situation. After several hours of tense negotiations, the SWAT team was forced to take drastic action when Brown stopped communicating with them. Fearing for the lives of the hostages, authorities made the harrowing decision to storm the house. In the ensuing chaos, a hail of gunfire erupted as SWAT officers entered the residence. Brown was fatally wounded and later pronounced dead at the scene. All four firefighters were successfully rescued, but one suffered a gunshot wound to the hand. Thankfully, his injuries are not life-threatening, and he is expected to make a full recovery. Aftermath: The suburban Atlanta neighborhood where the hostage crisis took place returned to a sense of normalcy as the investigation continues. Brown's violent actions have left the local community shocked and saddened. The incident will undoubtedly leave lasting physical and psychological scars on those involved and will also prompt deeper discussions about societal and economic pressures driving people like Brown to such desperate and dangerous acts. Community response: In the days that followed, Atlanta residents came together to show their support for the first responders and the emotional ordeal they had experienced. Vigils, fundraisers, and tributes were organized to honor their bravery and provide emotional and financial assistance to those affected by the hostage crisis. As questions about Brown's motivations and the societal factors that contributed to his actions linger, the community can take solace in the fact that their first responders did everything in their power to protect and serve under challenging circumstances. However, the incident serves as a stark reminder that more needs to be done to address the growing desperation faced by many Americans, which can sometimes lead to dangerous and unforeseeable consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many important biochemical reactions, such as energy generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The general lack of internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm. How does electron transit occur in bacteria?","output":"Electron transit, or more commonly known as electron transport, occurs in bacteria primarily across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. This transit is facilitated by the fact that there is a general lack of internal membranes in bacteria, so all major biochemical reactions occur across the cell membrane itself. This is used for crucial processes like energy generation, which involve concentration gradients. In the specific case of electron transport, it is part of the metabolic process wherein cells capture and store energy. How it works is that electrons are passed along a chain of proteins and other molecules in a process of redox reactions, going from one molecule to another. This eventually leads to the creation of an electrochemical gradient, which is used to synthesize ATP, the primary energy currency of cells. The structure and processes within the bacteria cell membrane allow for this electron transit to occur efficiently. For example, in photosynthetic bacteria, the plasma membrane is highly folded, filling most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membranes which can enhance the efficiency of these energy-generating reactions. These can even form lipid-enclosed structures known as chlorosomes, particularly in green sulfur bacteria. These chlorosomes aid further in maximizing the efficiency of light absorption and therefore, energy generation. On top of this, there are also other membrane proteins present that carry out other functions crucial to the cell's survival. For instance, some proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, while others expel unneeded or harmful molecules from the cytoplasm, protecting the cell’s internal environment and ensuring its overall function and health. Overall, electron transit in bacteria takes place across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and periplasmic space, facilitating critical energy generation and other processes necessary for survival and function. This is made possible by the unique structure of bacterial cell membranes and the variety of proteins they host."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Around 1730, the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.Façades of churches often came to resemble wedding cakes rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as \\"either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island\\".

Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.  - Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , / trtkeli / is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second - generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first - cross ) triticales . As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop . Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale - based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) . The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself . The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world . The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale . Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time . The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application . The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals . The protein content is...  - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as more fully herbivorous animals.  - Rice is the seed of the grass species \\"Oryza sativa\\" (Asian rice) or \\"Oryza glaberrima\\" (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China.  - Silage is fermented, high-moisture stored fodder which can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals) or used as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digesters. It is fermented and stored in a process called \\"ensilage\\", \\"ensiling\\" or \\"silaging\\", and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type (\\"oatlage\\" for oats, \\"haylage\\" for alfalfa  but see below for the different British use of the term \\"haylage\\").  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Rye (\\"Secale cereale\\") is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus \\"Hordeum\\") and wheat (\\"Triticum\\"). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats.  - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera found in this tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat \\"Triticum\\" species. Seed storage proteins in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances.  - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems.  - The chicken (\\"Gallus gallus domesticus\\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.  - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.  - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates.  - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals.  - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin.  - There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing.  - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\"  a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany.  - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\".  - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).  - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century.  - Animal feed is food given to domestic animals in the course of animal husbandry. There are two basic types, \\"fodder\\" and \\"forage\\". Used alone, the word \\"feed\\" more often refers to fodder.  - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe.  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".  - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.  - Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Daniel Irvin Rather, Jr.  was born on October 31, 1931, in Wharton County, Texas, the son of Daniel Irvin Rather, Sr., a ditch digger, and the former Byrl Veda Page. The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian. On September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times.  Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them.  On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \\"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \\"Memogate\\" and \\"Rathergate.\\"  Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign. Many believe Rather's retirement was hastened by this incident. On September 20, 2007, Rather was interviewed on Larry King Live commenting \\"Nobody has proved that they were fraudulent, much less a forgery. ... The truth of this story stands up to this day.\\" What year were the memos released?","output":"The memos were released on September 8, 2004.

This question has different components to consider: - The primary subject of the question is a comic strip, suggesting that a potential response should be the name of a comic strip. - This comic strip is not just any comic strip, but one that occasionally includes a postman named Beasley. As such, a correct response would not only need to identify a comic strip but also demonstrate knowledge of its characters and recurring or occasional themes. - Beasley is specified to be a postman. By including this profession, the question might be hinting towards the thematic elements of the comic strip or the environment in which it takes place. Beasley could be a significant character in this comic strip or maybe a secondary or occasional character who has a certain relation to the main plot.  The question does not give any other information about the art style or content theme of the comic strip, or when and where it was published.

Passage: Bankruptcy On July 13, 2015, Jackson filed for Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut with a debt of 32,509,549.91. On July 17, 2015, the Court issued an order allowing a creditor to proceed with the punitive damages phase of a trial against Jackson in a New York state court, in connection with the alleged release of a private video. His assets were listed as between 10 million and 50 million in his bankruptcy petition, though he testified under oath that he is worth 4.4 million. Citing between 10 million and 50 million in debt, and the same amount in assets. Later in the week, Jacksons bankruptcy lawyers elucidated the court documents that legal fees and judgments exceeding 20 million over the past year were the primary cause of the filing. His filings listed 32 entities that he has a stake in. The bankruptcy came days after a jury ordered him to pay 5 million to rapper Rick Rosss ex-girlfriend Lastonia Leviston for invading her privacy by posting online a sex tape of her and another man. In addition, Jackson lost a dispute over a failed business deal to come to fruition to his Sleek headphones, where Jackson invested more than 2 million. An ex-partner accused Jackson of later stealing the design of the \\"Sleek by 50\\" headphones, prompting a judge to award the partner more than 17.2 million. His Connecticut bankruptcy filing states that he owns seven cars valued at more than 500,000, including a 2010 Rolls Royce and a 1966 Chevrolet Coupe. His expenses of 108,000 a month include 5,000 for gardening along with a monthly income of 185,000, mainly from royalties and income from his external businesses and investments. The court filing says he also owes money to his stylist, his barber and his fitness coach. Other details in the bankruptcy documents included information about two deals that sold the right to collect royalties of on-air play of his music. Half the rights to his portfolio were sold to the British independent music publishing company Kobalt Music Group for 3 million and the other half for another 3 million with the sales of his albums allowing Jackson to own 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings while paying only for distribution. Zeisler & Zeisler, a Bridgeport law firm, represented 50 Cent in the bankruptcy, which later resulted in Jackson filing a 75 million lawsuit against his own lawyers. He stated that his lawyers did a terrible job of representing him, specifically citing the fallout of his failed venture with Sleek Audio headphones and accused Garvey Schubert Barer, a Wall Street law firm of failing to \\"employ the requisite knowledge and skill necessary to confront the circumstances of the case.\\".","output":"Task: Create complex questions from the given passage that involve numerical reasoning and various answer types (spans, numbers, dates). Question 1: How much more does Jackson's income from royalties and external businesses exceed his 108,000 monthly expenses? Answer Type: Number Explanation: Jackson's monthly income is mentioned to be 185,000 from royalties and external businesses. His monthly expenses are listed as 108,000. Hence, we need to subtract 108,000 from 185,000 to find out the difference. 185,000 - 108,000 = 77,000 Question 2: What was the combined cost for Jackson for the Sleek headphones dispute and the invasion of privacy case for Lastonia Leviston? Answer Type: Number Explanation: Jackson was ordered to pay 5 million to Leviston for invading her privacy. Additionally, he had to pay more than 17.2 million in the Sleek headphones dispute. We need to add both the amounts to get the combined cost. 5,000,000 + 17,200,000 = 22,200,000 Question 3: How much did Jackson receive in total by selling half of the rights to his music portfolio to Kobalt Music Group and the other half for owning 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings? Answer Type: Number Explanation: Jackson sold half of the rights to his music portfolio to Kobalt Music Group for 3 million and the other half for another 3 million. We need to add both amounts to get the total he received. 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 6,000,000 Question 4: How much in debt did Jackson file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and how much money did he claim to owe his stylist, barber, and fitness coach by 2015?

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Surface Tension Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension. Molecules on the surface are pulled inward by cohesive forces, reducing the surface area. Molecules inside the liquid experience zero net force, since they have neighbors on all sides. Surface Tension Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension. Making Connections: Surface Tension Forces between atoms and molecules underlie the macroscopic effect called surface tension. These attractive forces pull the molecules closer together and tend to minimize the surface area. This is another example of a submicroscopic explanation for a macroscopic phenomenon. The model of a liquid surface acting like a stretched elastic sheet can effectively explain surface tension effects. For example, some insects can walk on water (as opposed to floating in it) as we would walk on a trampoline—they dent the surface as shown in Figure 11.28(a). Figure 11.28(b) shows another example, where a needle rests on a water surface. The iron needle cannot, and does not, float, because its density is greater than that of water. Rather, its weight is supported by forces in the stretched surface that try to make the surface smaller or flatter. If the needle were placed point down on the surface, its weight acting on a smaller area would break the surface, and it would sink.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. In 1931, 12-year-old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in Paris with his father (Jude Law), a widowed, but kind clockmaker who also works at a museum. One day his father finds a broken automaton, a mechanical man designed to write with a pen, at the museum, and he and Hugo try to repair it, his father documenting the automaton in a notebook. When his father is killed by a fire at the museum, Hugo is forced to live with his resentful, alcoholic uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), and made to learn how to maintain the clocks at the railway station of Gare Montparnasse. When Claude goes missing for several days, Hugo continues to maintain the clocks, fearing that he would be sent away as an orphan by the vindictive Station Inspector Gustave (Sacha Baron Cohen) if Claude's absence is discovered. Hugo attempts to repair the automaton with stolen parts, believing it contains a message from his father, but the machine still requires a heart-shaped key that his father could not find.Hugo is caught when stealing from the toy store owner Georges (Ben Kingsley), who looks through his father's notebook and threatens to destroy it. Hugo encounters Georges' goddaughter Isabelle (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) who offers to help get the notebook back. Hugo learns Georges has forbidden Isabelle from going to the cinema, and introduces the medium to her as his father had done for him. As their friendship grows, he shows her the automaton, and is surprised when Isabelle reveals she wears the key as a necklace given to her by Georges. When started, the machine draws out a scene that Hugo recognizes from his father's description of the film A Trip to the Moon. Isabelle identifies the signature, that of a \\"Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s\\", as her godfather. She sneaks Hugo into her home, where they find a hidden cache of more imaginative drawings of MÃ©liÃ¨s, but are caught by Georges, who banishes Hugo from his home.Hugo and Isabelle go to the Film Academy Library and find a book about the history of cinema that praises MÃ©liÃ¨s' contributions. They meet the book's author, RenÃ© Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg), a film expert who is surprised to hear that MÃ©liÃ¨s may still be alive, as he had disappeared after World War I along with nearly all copies of his films. Excited at the chance to meet him, RenÃ© agrees to meet Isabelle and Hugo at Georges' home to show his copy of A Trip to the Moon, hoping it will invigorate Georges. On the scheduled night, Georges' wife Jeanne (Helen McCrory) tries to turn them away, but RenÃ© compliments Jeanne as Jeanne d'Alcy, an actress in many of MÃ©liÃ¨s' films, and she allows them to continue. As the film plays, Georges threatens to send them away, but Jeanne convinces him to cherish his accomplishments rather than regret his lost dream. Georges recounts that as a stage magician, he had been fascinated by motion pictures and used the medium to create imaginative works through his Star Film Company, but was forced into bankruptcy following the War, closing his studio and selling his films to be turned into raw materials. He laments that even an automaton he made that he donated to a museum was lost. Hugo recognizes this is the same automaton he has, and races to the station to retrieve it. He is caught by Gustave, who has learned that Claude's body was found some time ago, and threatens to take Hugo to the orphanage. Georges arrives and tells Gustave that he will now see to Hugo, adopting him as his son.Some time later, Georges is named a professor at the Film Academy, and is paid tribute through a showcase of his films recovered by RenÃ©.

They noted that Lamb, 33, a handsome (and clean-shaven) military veteran, was straight from central casting and had no extensive political record to contradict stances so moderate and squishy that he could be mistaken, well, for a Republican. They said that Democrats would be hard-pressed to find many more Lambs with which to slaughter the G.O.P. in November.      “When your message is simply I am for new leadership and cleaning up Washington, and you look like you just walked out of an Orvis catalog, you are going to connect with voters on both sides of the aisle,” wrote Salena Zito in The Washington Examiner late last week.      “Lamb never slams Trump,” she observed. “He is not part of the resistance.” He further blunted Republicans’ favorite weapon against Democratic candidates for the House — they’re just would-be pawns of the dreaded Nancy Pelosi! — by running an ad that made clear that he would not support her as his party’s leader in that chamber.      The point that Zito was correctly making was that many of the Democrats who will vie to unseat Republican incumbents in House races in November won’t be able to follow Lamb’s playbook. To get through their party’s primaries, they’ll have to stake out more progressive ground than he did, and adopt a more combative, fiery tone. That could undercut their chances of replicating his success.      Indeed, Democrats’ euphoria over how he fared on Tuesday will give way to sharp internal tensions and sustained quarreling over which sorts of candidates — soft-spoken or bold, centrist or liberal, eclectic or pure — the party would be wisest, from a pragmatic standpoint, to promote. Many Democratic voters want someone less mild and muddled than Lamb.      But if the Pennsylvania results put Democrats in an awkward position, they leave Republicans in an even worse place. What exactly is their best strategy for the midterms?      Not all of their candidates will be leagues better than Saccone, who is no Roy Moore and is himself a military veteran. Sending President Trump into districts that supposedly smile on him isn’t looking like such a hot proposition. The mantra of “tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts” is obviously no panacea.      And with each passing week — each passing day — the Trump administration’s turbulence intensifies and the scandals and scandal-ettes pile up. Yes, it’s a long way from now until November, and much about the national mood and the playing field can change. But in that yawning stretch of time, Trump can also render himself and his enablers even less attractive.

Lamb, a Marine veteran, told his crowd that voters had directed him to \\"do your job\\" in Washington. \\"Mission accepted,\\" he declared. Earlier, Saccone told his own supporters, \\"It's not over yet, we're going to fight all the way, all the way to the end, we'll never give up.\\"      Regardless of the outcome — and a recount was possible — Lamb's showing in a district Trump won by 20 points in the presidential race was sure to stoke anxiety among Republicans nationwide and renewed enthusiasm among Democrats.      After midnight with all precincts reporting, unofficial results had Lamb leading Republican state Rep. Saccone by fewer than 600 votes. More than 1,000 absentee ballots were still being tabulated as the count carried into Wednesday.      In a race this close, either candidate's supporters can ask for a recount. However there are stiff requirements, including requiring three voters in the same precinct who can attest that error or fraud was committed.      The stakes in the high-profile special election were more political than practical.      The ultimate winner will face re-election in just eight months, and the congressional district as currently shaped will likely vanish next year thanks to a court-ordered redrawing of the state's district maps. Yet President Trump and his chief allies invested tremendous time and resources in keeping the seat in Republican hands, mindful the contest could be used to measure Trump's lasting appeal among white, working-class voters and Democrats' anti-Trump fervor.      The White House scrambled to rally voters behind Saccone, who cast himself as the president's \\"wingman,\\" but he struggled at times to connect with the blue-collar coalition that fueled Trump's victory little more than a year ago.      Lamb, a 33-year old former federal prosecutor, asserted his independence from the Democratic Party, courted labor backing and focused on local issues. He studiously downplayed his opposition to the Republican president in the district where Trump's support has slipped by not plummeted.      \\"This didn't have much to do with President Trump,\\" Lamb said Tuesday after casting his vote in suburban Pittsburgh.      The president has campaigned in the district twice and sent several tweets on Saccone's behalf. Other recent visitors include the vice president, the president's eldest son, the president's daughter and the president's chief counselor. Outside groups aligned with Republicans poured more than 10 million of dollars into the contest.      For Democrats, a win would reverberate nationwide, while even a narrow loss would be viewed as a sign of increased Democratic enthusiasm just as the midterm season begins.      Lamb's excited supporters included his middle school football and basketball coach, Joe DelSardo, who recalled him as \\"a leader from the beginning.\\"      The former coach described the district as having \\"a lot of suit-and-tie people and people who dig in the dirt.\\" Lamb, he said, \\"can talk to all of them, and that's why he can win.\\"      Registered Republican Brett Gelb said he voted for Saccone, largely because the Republican candidate promised to support the president.      \\"Saccone backs a lot of President Trump's plans for the country,\\" said Gelb, a 48-year-old fire technician who lives in Mt. Lebanon. He added, \\"I do think Trump is doing a good job. I think he needs backup.\\"      Democrats must flip 24 GOP-held seats this fall to seize control of the House, and months ago few had counted on the district to be in play. The seat has been in Republican hands for the past 15 years.      It was open now only because longtime Republican congressman Tim Murphy, who espoused strong anti-abortion views, resigned last fall amid revelations of an extramarital affair in which he urged his mistress to get an abortion.      With polls showing a tight race for months, Saccone tried to persuade the GOP-leaning electorate that their choice was about \\"making America great again,\\" as the president repeatedly says.      Saccone, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran turned state lawmaker and college instructor, enjoyed enthusiastic backing from the social conservatives who've anchored his state career. He's been perhaps at his most animated when emphasizing his opposition to abortion rights.      Yet Saccone struggled to raise money and stir the same passions that helped Trump on his way to the White House. The consistent fundraising deficit left him with limited resources to air the message he delivered one-on-one: His four decades of experience in the private sector, international business and now the Legislature should make voters' choice a no-brainer.      Lamb, meanwhile, excited core Democrats and aimed for independents and moderate Republicans.      \\"We worked really hard for it,\\" Lamb said after voting.      National Republican groups filled airwaves and social media with depictions of the first-time candidate as little more than a lemming for Nancy Pelosi — the Democratic House leader that Republicans love to hate.      Lamb answered the criticism by saying he wouldn't support Pelosi as floor leader, much less as speaker if the Democrats should retake control of the House. He also said he opposes major new gun restrictions — though he backs expanded background checks — and declared himself personally opposed to abortion, despite his support for its legality.      Besides bruising the president, a Lamb defeat also could shake Republican self-assurance that their new tax law can shield them from other political woes.      Lamb embraced Democratic orthodoxy on the new GOP tax law, hammering it as a giveaway to corporations at the future expense of Social Security, Medicare and the nation's fiscal security. And he embraces unions, highlighting Saccone's anti-labor record at the statehouse, which was a notable deviation from the retiring Murphy's status as a union-friendly Republican.      The AFL-CIO counts 87,000 voters from union households — around a fifth of the electorate.      ___      Peoples reported from New York.      ___      Follow Barrow and Levy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarowAP and https://twitter.com/timelywriter . ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The recent special election in Pennsylvania, where Democrat Conor Lamb claimed victory by a razor-thin margin, has raised questions about the ideal strategy for both Democrats and Republicans leading up to the November midterms. Lamb's moderate stances and refusal to be part of \\"the resistance\\" against President Trump allowed him to connect with voters on both sides of the aisle, something many Democrats might not be able to achieve in their own primaries. Meanwhile, Republicans face their own challenges, as the Trump administration's turbulence has intensified, and tax cuts appear to be no panacea. Both parties will face internal tensions as they decide whether to promote soft-spoken, centrist candidates or bolder, more liberal ones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Our voice gives away a lot of information about ourselves. It can tell us our gender and age. And now, scientists say that it can also tell us our height. Scientists at Washington University, Indiana University and University of California found that listeners could accurately tell the height of speakers, just by their voices. And the key to this mystery is a sound known as the subglottal resonance . It _ with height and helps us build a mental picture of a person. \\"The best way to think about subglottal resonances is to imagine blowing into a glass bottle with water. The less water in the bottle, the lower sound,\\" said John Morton, a scientist at Washington University. And it's the same for humans. The frequency of the subglottal resonance depends on the height. The taller we are, the deeper the resonance frequency is. In order to find out whether people could identify the resonance, scientists did experiments. A number of same-sex pairs of different heights were told to read the same sentence aloud. It was played back to listeners who had to choose which one of the pairs was taller. Then, other listeners had to rank the speakers from the shortest to the tallest. The listeners were able to identify the tall people 62.17% of time, much higher than a lucky guess. Why not try the experiment yourself? Find out if your tall friends have deeper voices.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Who is goaded into punching Hawkeye? Movie plot title: MASH Movie plot: The plot is told as a series of (presumably chronological) vignettes surrounding the life of the namesake Mobile Army Surgical Hospital where it is set. While the episodic film lacks the cohesion of an overarching singular plot with a traditional narrative structure, the vignettes do present a clear means for the film to explore the themes of military life. Set in 1951 in South Korea, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is assigned two replacements: Captains \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and \\"Duke\\" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Jeep. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. As the film progresses, further scenes introduce additional characters. Some characters are already at the camp when Hawkeye and Duke arrive, such as the bumbling commander Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, the morose dentist Walter \\"Painless\\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy. Other characters arrive after Hawkeye and Duke, and become integrated into camp life, such as surgeon Trapper John and Nurse Margaret Houlihan. After the characters are introduced, which forms the opening act, further comedic episodes explore the evolving relationships between the characters. The main characters in the camp divide into two factions; Hawkeye, Duke, and Trapper John form one faction; all three were drafted into the army and are not as dedicated to the mission or lifestyle of the military. They are prone to pranks and heavy drinking. The other faction forms around the romantic relationship between Majors Houlihan and Burns, who are both career military personnel. The two factions battle back and forth in a series of pranks and reprisals (one involving exposing a naked Houlihan to the camp when the walls of the shower tent are collapsed, another embarrassing the couple by exposing their heretofore secret romance) until Burns is goaded into punching Hawkeye and removed from the unit for...

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The art of public speaking began in ancient Greece over 2,000 years ago. Now, twitter, e-mail, blogs and QQ chat offer approaches to communication-- but none can replace the role of a great speech. The spoken word can handle various important functions: persuading or inspiring, informing, paying tribute  , entertaining, or simply introducing someone. Persuading is used in dealing with or _ different points of view. When the leaders met in Copenhagen in December, 2009, persuasive words from activities encouraged them to take former action. Inspirational speeches deal with emotions. They focus on topics and matters that are close to people' s hearts. Last year, during the fighting in Iraq, generals used inspiring speeches to prepare the troops for battle. Some speeches spread knowledge and deepen understanding. When the H1N1 flu was announced, the disease scared many people. Informtive speechs from World Health Organization (WTO) officials helped people to keep their panic under control so they could take necessary preventive measures. Sad events are never easy to deal with but a speech that pays tribute to the loss of a loved one and gives praise for their contribution can be comforting. Madonna's speech about Michael Jackson after his death showed the fact that he will continue to live on through his music. It's not only in world forums where public speaking plays an important role. It can also be helpful in the course of our own life. You may be asked to do a presentation at college or work to inform others about an area of great importance. On a more personal level, a friend may be upset and need comforting. Or you might be asked to introduce a speaker at a family gathering or to speak at a wedding, where your language will be needed to move people or make them laugh. Great speaking ability is not something we're born with. Even Barack Obama works hard to perfect every speech. Question: What would be the best title for the passage?

Traditionally, it is limited by the Apennines to the south-west, the Adriatic to the east, and the rivers Reno and Sillaro to the north and west. The region's major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forlì, Imola, Ravenna, Rimini and City of San Marino (San Marino is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region).

Etymology. The name \\"Romagna\\" comes from the Latin name \\"Romània\\", which originally was the generic name for \\"land inhabited by Romans\\", and first appeared on Latin documents in the 5th century. It later took on the more detailed meaning of \\"territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule\\", whose citizens called themselves Romans (\\"Romani\\" in Latin; \\"Romàioi\\" in Greek). Thus the term \\"Romània\\" came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named \\"Langobardia\\" or \\"Lombardy\\". \\"Romània\\" later became \\"Romandìola\\" in Vulgar Latin, meaning \\"little Romània\\", which became \\"Romagna\\" in modern times.

From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, \\"De Principatibus\\" (\\"About Principalities\\"). However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but \\"long before then, in fact since the first appearance of \\"The Prince\\" in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings\\".  - The Black Rose is a 1950 20th Century Fox Technicolor film starring Tyrone Power and Orson Welles, loosely based on Thomas B. Costain's book. It was filmed partly on location in England and Morocco which substitutes for the Gobi Desert of China. The film was partly conceived as a follow-up to the movie \\"Prince of Foxes\\", and reunited the earlier film's two stars. Talbot Jennings' screenplay was based on a popular novel of the same name by Canadian author Thomas B. Costain, published in 1945, introducing an anachronistic Saxon rebellion against the Norman aristocracy as a vehicle for launching the protagonists on their journey to the Orient.   - Duke of Valentinois, formerly Count of Valentinois, is a title of nobility, originally in the French peerage. Though the duchy was once associated with administrative authority as well as possession of manors in Valence in France's \\"\\", those noble prerogatives were whittled away and by the 20th century it was a nominal dukedom consisting of a hereditary title descending in the male line.  - Prince of Foxes is a 1947 historical novel by Samuel Shellabarger, following the adventures of the fictional Andrea Orsini, a captain in the service of Cesare Borgia during his conquest of the Romagna.  - Samuel Shellabarger (18881954) was an American educator and author of both scholarly works and best-selling historical novels.

Steven and Linda Kologi, their 18-year-old daughter Brittany, and a 70-year-old family friend were gunned down in a Long Branch home shortly before midnight. The Kologis' 16-year-old son now stands accused of the killings.      No motive has been revealed by authorities. Friends and neighbors were at a loss for answers Monday.      \\"I just can't understand why,\\" said family friend Veronica Mass, 69, of Union Beach. \\"What happened? I just have no idea.\\"      The teen, who faces a court hearing Tuesday on the charges, has not been named by authorities because he is a juvenile. Prosecutors said Monday they intended to seek that he be tried as an adult. He is being held at the Middlesex Youth Detention Facility.      The 16-year-old's brother and grandfather were also inside the home, a multifamily house on the 600 block of Wall Street, but were able to escape unharmed, officials said.      A 911 call reporting the shooting was made at 11:43 p.m. from inside the home. The teen's parents, Steven, 44, and Linda Kologi, 42, his sister Brittany Kologi, 18, and family friend, Mary Schulz, 70, of Ocean Township, were pronounced dead at the scene.      Police said there was no history of violence at the home. The Century Arms semi-automatic rifle used in the killings was legally obtained and owned by a resident of the house.      Mass said she was \\"stunned\\" when she heard the news of the shooting. Linda Kologi and Mass' daughter were close friends growing up together in Jersey City.      \\"They were a close-knit family,\\" Mass said. \\"No drugs, no alcohol.\\"      Mass said the 16-year-old was home-schooled since fourth or fifth grade because he had emotional problems. Other kids made fun of him, and he wasn't keeping up academically, she said, adding that a teacher told his mother he was learning disabled.      \\"He improved dramatically after being home-schooled,\\" Mass said. \\"He learned to read, did his math. He got up to where he was supposed to be.\\"      Socially she said he was \\"outgoing, very friendly. He would tell jokes.\\"      Mass was also surprised to learn there was a gun in the home.      \\"Big Steve, he did not like any guns in the house,\\" she said. \\"If they owned a gun, I had no knowledge of it.\\"      Mass said Linda's sister and her husband live in another unit of the multifamily home, and were home when the shooting happened.      Jalen Walls, a neighbor who went to high school with Brittany Kologi, also said her brother required special assistance and was cared for by his mother.      \\"But he was fully functional and comprehended what we were saying,\\" said Walls, 18.      Brittany Kologi was a freshman at Stockton University and was studying health sciences.      \\"We are shocked and saddened by the reports of the death of freshman Brittany Kologi under such tragic circumstances,\\" the school said in a statement, adding that counseling is available for her friends and classmates at Stockton.

(CBSNewYork/AP) — New details were released Tuesday in a quadruple homicide in Long Branch.      A 16-year-old New Jersey boy accused of fatally shooting his parents, sister and a family friend on New Year’s Eve.      Monmouth County prosecutors say the teen would not be in the courtroom for the Family Court hearing on Tuesday. He was due to appear via video conference and the arraignment proceedings were to be closed to the public.      The suspect’s name is being withheld because he is a minor.      The teen faces four counts of murder and a weapons offense stemming from the shooting that occurred late Sunday night in Long Branch. Authorities have not disclosed a motive for the slayings but have said they may seek to move the case to adult court.      On Tuesday, the court heard arguments from a local newspaper to make the case public even if the suspect was tried as a juvenile.      A hearing planned for Wednesday, will determine if the boy will be held during the trial, and another hearing will determine if he will be tried as an adult.      Investigators say the teen used a semi-automatic rifle, legally owned by a family member, to kill his parents, 44-year-old Steven Kologi and 42-year-old Linda Kologi, his 18-year-old sister Brittany and his grandfather’s girlfriend, 70-year-old Mary Schultz, who lived with the family. The shooting happened just minutes before midnight during a New Year’s Eve party at the family’s home on Wall Street in Long Branch.      The teen’s grandfather and brother were not targeted and left the home unharmed. Authorities say the gun used in the killings was owned by one of the survivors.      Authorities also said a third person — an acquaintance of one of the relatives — escaped the home after hearing shots fired.      Monmouth County Prosecutor Chris Gramiccioni described the shooting as an isolated domestic incident and said the teen was taken into custody without issue.      “It’s a terribly tragic incident,” he said Monday.      Friends and relatives are overcome by the enormous loss.      “He always had your back no matter what. He always had your back,” said Steven Kologi’s childhood friend Ronnie Pacheco. “He loved his kids to death, he loved all his kids to death.”      “Always smiling, not a violent kid or anything like that,” said family friend Joe Rios.      “Why’d he do that to my cousin? Why would he kill his own mother? She was so good to that boy,” relative Walter Montelione said.      Relatives describe Linda as a doting mother. Brittany was a freshman at Stockton University and they say Steven worked multiple jobs to support his family.      “He loved his kids to death,” said Pacheco.      Investigators say the teen did not have a criminal history.      “He was a good kid, he was a little you know slow with learning disabilities but he knows right from wrong,” Montelione said.      A family friend has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for the family’s funeral expenses.      Friends and family members were also planning a vigil in Long Branch at the Franklin Lake gazebo on Tuesday night.      (© Copyright 2018 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The next morning, after wearing masks, we were allowed to go to the ICU to see Andrea. Well, the least I could say was that everything was injured in her body and she lost all of her memories. It was a fatal accident. Over the next two months, I lived more at the hospital than I did at my house. I watched as Andrea worked so hard to gain back everyday motor skills. She never once complained or pitied herself; her determined spirit was shining through. After two weeks in the ICU and two months of the regular hospital treatment, Andrea was able to come home. She missed several months of school, so it was hard for her to catch up. Andrea had tasks to accomplish, and no matter how hard it was, she stuck with them until the job was done. Though busy with dealing with pain and therapy, she always found time to love and play with me. I'll never forget the impact that this incident made on my life.

By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to  visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when  he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after  further surgery  he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital  went well, but his conducting in the afternoon  was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\".  Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie  that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs.  His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record  attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days. But I have not succeeded yet.\\"Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of 78.

In her annual report on the state of health, Dame Sally Davies said this was concerning, pointing out many people did not recognise they had a problem. Parents of overweight children were also failing to spot the signs too, she said. Dame Sally blamed the way weight was being portrayed by the media and clothes industry. Calculate your BMI \\"I have long been concerned that being underweight is often portrayed as the ideal weight, particularly in the fashion industry. \\"Yet I am increasingly concerned that society may be normalising being overweight. \\"Larger mannequins are being introduced into clothes shops and \\"size inflation\\" means that clothes with the same size label have become larger in recent decades. \\"And news stories about weight often feature pictures of severely obese people, which are unrepresentative of the majority of overweight people.\\" Dame Sally also reiterated her belief that a sugar tax may be necessary to combat obesity. At the start of March she told the Health Select Committee it may be needed, although she hoped not. This caused some controversy as the government's approach has been characterised by working with industry to get them to make food and drink products healthier. In her report she says this should continue, but if it fails to deliver a tax should be \\"considered\\". She said children and adults of all ages are consuming too much sugar. Nearly two thirds of adults and a third of children are overweight or obese - classed as a body mass index of above 25. This is about double the numbers in the early 1990s. But research shows that half of men, a third of women and over three quarters of parents do not recognise weight problems. Professor Kevin Fenton, of Public Health England, said he agreed with Dame Sally's comments. \\"We share her concerns. Overweight and obesity costs the NHS over Â£5bn each year and is entirely preventable.\\" But Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said he would have liked Dame Sally to take a tougher approach to sugar. \\"The report lets the food and beverage industries off the hook. It gives industry no deadline by which to show improvement with the likely result that her words will be quite ignored.

It was December before they won their first Championship match of the season, but later that month they were still nine points behind second bottom Dunfermline. Following a busy January transfer window - with 10 players arriving and 10 players departing - Ross began to turn St Mirren's fortunes around and based on the last eight games, they are the form side in the Championship, sitting two points clear of Raith Rovers who are in the relegation play-off position. \\"Again the summer will be a testing period for us in terms of retaining players.

Article: In 1948, Eisenhower became President of Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City. The assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction. During that year Eisenhower's memoir, Crusade in Europe, was published. Critics regarded it as one of the finest U.S. military memoirs, and it was a major financial success as well. Eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that Eisenhower was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences, and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his 635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate. This ruling saved Eisenhower about 400,000.

Choose your answer from: -no. -yes.","output":"No. The questions \\"How harmful could tomatoes be for dogs?\\" and \\"Is butter harmful to dogs?\\" are not the same. They are asking about the potential harmful effects of two different substances -- tomatoes and butter -- on dogs. To provide a comprehensive explanation: Firstly, regarding tomatoes, it is important to note that they belong to the nightshade family of vegetables, which contain substances called solanines that can be toxic to dogs. Green, unripe tomatoes, the plant itself, and especially the leaves and stems contain higher levels of solanine and could be harmful to dogs. Some of the signs of tomato poisoning in dogs can include gastrointestinal upset like diarrhea and vomiting, confusion, drowsiness, an abnormal heart rate, and in severe cases, even seizures. Also, the ingestion of a large amount of tomatoes could lead to solanine toxicity in dogs which could be fatal if not treated promptly. However, ripe tomatoes are usually safe for dogs in small amounts because they have lower solanine levels. But it would still be prudent to keep tomatoes out of your pet's reach, especially small dogs who could easily ingest a considerable amount relative to their body weight. Secondly, addressing the question \\"Is butter harmful to dogs?\\", butter is not inherently toxic to dogs, but it can still pose significant health risks if consumed in large amounts. Butter is high in fat, and excessive amounts can lead to obesity and related health problems such as pancreatitis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas that can occur when a dog consumes fatty foods like butter. Signs can include abdominal pain, vomiting, lethargy, and diarrhea. Moreover, butter can also contribute to increased cholesterol levels, potentially harming a dog's cardiovascular health over time. Depending on the individual dog and the amount consumed, butter could also cause gastrointestinal upset resulting in vomiting or diarrhea. For these reasons, it's generally best to avoid giving your dog butter, except in very small amounts. Though these questions pertain to the same general topic (foods that could be harmful to dogs), they deal with different specific foods and thereby involve different considerations. Therefore, the answer is no, these questions are not the same."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

This doesn't directly interfere with the process of viral multiplication or the steps of the virus in the host body, but it can indirectly influence the process. Specifically, it could impact how quickly and efficiently the host body can combat the virus.  A run-down or weakened immune system might not be as effective in its initial response to the virus. This could potentially allow the virus to replicate and spread more easily initially. On the other hand, a weakened host could potentially translate to a less robust cellular environment for the virus to multiply - possibly slowing the spread or reducing the total viral load. However, these are indirect impacts. They don't change the mechanism of how the virus enters a cell, uses it like a factory to produce new copies, and leaves to infect other cells.

In 1984, Ray Parker Jr. was signed by the producers of Ghostbusters to develop the film's title song. Later that year, Huey Lewis and the News sued Parker, citing the similarities between the \\"Ghostbusters\\" song and their earlier hit \\"I Want a New Drug.\\" According to Huey Lewis and the News, this was especially damaging to them since \\"Ghostbusters\\" was so popular, rising to number one on the charts for three weeks. The dispute was ultimately settled out of court. Lewis has stated that his experiences with the producers of Ghostbusters were indirectly responsible for getting involved in the 1985 movie Back to the Future.  In the 2001 Behind the Music special, Huey Lewis stated: \\"The offensive part was not so much that Ray Parker Jr. had ripped this song off, it was kind of symbolic of an industry that wants something - they wanted our wave, and they wanted to buy it. ... [I]t's not for sale. ... In the end, I suppose they were right. I suppose it was for sale, because, basically, they bought it.\\" As a result of this statement, Parker filed a suit against Lewis, claiming he violated the settlement's confidentiality agreement and sought an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorney's fees.  An issue of Premiere magazine would later feature an anniversary article about the movie Ghostbusters. In that article, the filmmakers at Columbia Pictures admit to using the song \\"I Want a New Drug\\" as temporary background music in many scenes. They then said that they had made an offer to Huey Lewis and the News to write the main theme, but the band declined. In a 2001 Behind the Music special, Lewis said that the band declined the filmmakers' offer because the band had a prior contractual obligation to do a long concert tour to promote the hugely successful Sports album, which had just been released at the time, and didn't have time to write a main theme for a movie. The filmmakers gave film footage - with the Huey Lewis song in the background - to Ray Parker Jr., to aid Parker in writing the theme song.

Gabe wanted to bark tan his leather jacket for winter, so he bought the bark and ground it up into a powder. The","output":"next step was to create a solution that would permeate the leather and preserve it from the elements.  Step 1: Preparing the solution Gabe had to mix the ground bark powder with water in a container large enough to submerge his jacket. He considered the ratio of bark powder to water, which was roughly 1:5, so he added 5 litres of water for every 1 litre of bark powder he used. Gabe stirred the mixture well and let it sit for several hours to ensure the tannins were properly extracted from the bark. Step 2: Pre-treating the leather Before submerging the jacket in the solution, Gabe needed to clean it thoroughly to ensure proper penetration of the tannins. He used a mild soap and water to gently scrub the surface of the jacket, removing any dirt or oils. After rinsing it and allowing it to dry, Gabe was ready to move on to the next step. Step 3: Submerging the jacket and agitating Gabe placed his clean and dry jacket in the prepared bark tan solution, ensuring it was fully submerged. He weighed the jacket down with a heavy object to prevent it from floating up. Over the course of a week, Gabe agitated the mixture once a day to promote even distribution of tannins throughout the leather. He kept a close watch on the solution's color and concentration, adding more bark powder if necessary. Step 4: Monitoring the tanning process As the tanning process continued, Gabe frequently checked the jacket for any signs of improper tanning, such as uneven colors or stiff spots. He also looked for any warping or shrinking, adjusting the jacket's position in the solution to achieve the desired result. Step 5: Rinsing and oiling the leather After a week or when Gabe was satisfied with the tanning, he removed the jacket from the solution and rinsed it thoroughly with fresh water. Once the jacket was properly rinsed, Gabe patted it down with a clean towel to remove excess water and allowed it to air dry. Finally, he applied a light coat of leather conditioner to replenish the oils in the leather, keeping it supple and well-protected. With these steps complete, Gabe's leather jacket was now bark tanned and ready for winter. The process had not only preserved the jacket but also added a beautiful, rich color that would increase its aesthetic appeal and durability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: As cyber attacks swell, a move toward improved industry collaboration At the First Conference for computer security in Boston’s Park Plaza Hotel last June, Andre Ludwig listened as Holly Stewart, a product manager for Microsoft’s Malware Protection Center, lectured to a crowd of cyber professionals about a new program that would unite organizations against the growing wave of malware that infects computers across the globe. The Coordinated Malware Eradication program, or CME for short, calls for organizations to pool their resources—from tools to strategies—to fight the onslaught, she explained. Instead of beating malware back when it flares up, a coordinated response can eradicate it altogether. And that’s when Ludwig, a senior technical director at the data analytics company Novetta, had an idea. “We had just started working on some instrumentation against HiKit malware,” he says. “That requires a massive amount of reverse engineering and intelligence. My first thought was, ‘Oh, I’ve got something for you.’” Ludwig cornered Stewart after the presentation and the pair chatted about knocking heads together. In hindsight, the benefits seemed obvious. At a time when Moscow has shown a willingness to wage digital war and Chinese espionage is considered an economic strategy, the U.S. cyber security industry is moving toward more cooperation. In September, at FireEye’s MIRcon 2014 conference in Washington, D.C., Ret. Gen. Keith Alexander implored a swarm of industry veterans—from Microsoft MSFT security experts to the Belgian police’s cyber division—to abolish cyber crime entirely by banding together with each other and the federal government. Distrust of the National Security Agency aside, the sentiment resonates: If gangsters, businesses, and hostile states can team up, why can’t we? In October, Novetta and others announced the beginning stage of Operation SMN, a collaborative battle against the HiKit malware family, a favorite of well-funded and sophisticated hacking groups. Ten days later, the coalition released a report on the effects: 43,000 separate installations of tools related to Axiom, a prominent cyber espionage group allegedly sponsored by the Chinese state, were removed from machines covered by Operation SMN; 180 of those were examples of HiKit. “We’re really pleased with how this played out,” Novetta CEO Peter LaMontagne says. “Since the release, we’ve had significant success in degrading the capabilities of the malware, and the actors relying on it.” Operation SMN marks the first time that computer security players such as Microsoft, Symantec, FireEye FEYE , and Cisco CSCO are bonding without using federal or international law enforcement agencies as glue. In July Symantec, Microsoft, and other firms partnered with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency to take down Operation Zeus and Cryptolocker, both operations committed to criminal financial fraud. In May several firms worked with the FBI and Europol to arrest dozens of users of Blackshades, a remote-access Trojan virus sold to entry-level hackers in online black markets. Groups like Axiom, also known as Hidden Lynx, operate with what LaMontagne calls “extremely impressive” capabilities and resources, focusing on items in China’s stated five-year agenda. In 2012, the group targeted a tech hardware manufacturer contracted with the U.S. government. Unable to breach the security system, which was provided by the Waltham, Mass. security firm Bit9, Hidden Lynx instead broke into Bit9 itself to steal signing certificates and place malicious binaries onto the company’s servers. Operation SMN takes a page from the enemy’s playbook: sharing is caring. Groups like Hidden Lynx operate with massive synergy, says Eric Chien, a senior technical director at Symantec SYMC . Industry is moving to operate the same way, uniting technical experts by a love for problem-solving. “This didn’t come from the top-down, executive level,” LaMontagne says. “This was a personal interaction between really smart, really talented people in each organization who wanted to help each other out with their respective problems. We wanted to get back to that informal, hackathon-style interaction and the open-source ethos that goes with it.” And perhaps make fighting malware a far less slow and irritating process. “This is a prototype for a new methodology that shifts away from just observe and report,” Ludwig says. “This is collaboration for a more proactive approach of observe, analyze, distribute, then report. It’s a shift in the way we can solve problems.” Summary:","output":"The US cybersecurity industry is moving towards increased cooperation. Novetta, Microsoft, Symantec, FireEye, and Cisco have joined forces for Operation SMN, marking the first time that computer security players are collaborating without using federal or international law enforcement agencies as intermediaries. The operation aims to combat the HiKit malware family, and within ten days, the coalition reported 43,000 instances of tools related to a Chinese state-backed hacking group known as Axiom being removed from various machines. The collaboration is expected to be a shift in the approach to problem-solving related to coordinating malware remediation."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - Pay-per-view (PPV) is a type of pay television service by which a subscriber of a television service provider can purchase events to view via private telecast.

The IG is investigating whether Long misused government resources and personnel on trips back home to Hickory, North Carolina, on the weekends, said two of the officials. The IG’s interest was drawn after one of the vehicles — a black Suburban — was involved in an accident, according to one of the officials.      Long’s routine absences from the office due to frequent six-hour drives between North Carolina and Washington also drew Nielsen’s attention, this person said. Nielsen had raised the issue of Long’s in-office schedule with him in recent months, this person added.      At a meeting in late August, Nielsen confronted Long about his travel, though people familiar with the meeting gave conflicting accounts about whether she took the step of asking him to step down over the issue.      One of the officials said Nielsen asked Long to consider resigning, though he declined to do so and remains in his role. The program to support the FEMA administrator “was never intended for this purpose,” said the official.      Long did not respond to requests for comment from POLITICO but addressed the IG investigation at a FEMA briefing on Thursday morning, saying his office was working closely with the inspector general’s office “to make improvements to make sure we are running programs and policies according to regulation.”      “Bottom line is, we’ll continue to fully cooperate with any investigation that goes on and own up to any mistakes and push forward and keep going,” Long said.      “I would never intentionally run a program incorrectly,“ he added. “Doing something unethical is not part of my DNA, and it is not part of my track record in my whole entire career. We will work with the OIG.”      Jessica Nalepa, FEMA’s director of external affairs, said questions about specific IG investigations should be directed to DHS’ IG office and that FEMA fully cooperates with all investigations conducted by the IG. The DHS IG’s office and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.      “All questions about any potential investigation by the Office of the Inspector General should be directed to the IG. At this time, we are fully focused on preparing for, responding to, and recovering from Hurricane Florence and the storms in the Pacific,” said DHS press secretary Tyler Houlton. “The secretary is confident in the leadership at FEMA and their proven disaster management ability.”      Long started using a staff driver to get him home to North Carolina at the beginning of his tenure at FEMA last year. On the weekends Long spent in North Carolina, aides were put up in a hotel at taxpayer expense, according to one of the current officials.      DHS employees must be authorized to access government vehicles for personal use, including travel to a residence outside Washington, according to one of the officials. But a former DHS official said Long, as administrator, is entitled to have a contingency aide accompany him so he can have secure communications in case of a national emergency.      The former official added that Long “never asked for it and believed access to secure communications to be part of a presidential directive.” FEMA recently scaled back the use of the contingency team for cost-saving purposes, and Long now drives himself or flies to North Carolina.      Former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, who served under President Barack Obama, said he could remember using government cars for commuting purposes only in seven instances during the eight years he held the job. In those emergency or extreme cases, Fugate said, it was deemed appropriate for a FEMA aide to brief him face-to-face as a driver took him from his home in Gainesville, Florida, to the Jacksonville airport for outbound flights to Washington, where his presence was required.      Long previously worked at an emergency management consulting firm and also served as director of Alabama’s Emergency Management Agency.      The Trump administration has come under intense criticism for its response to the damage Hurricane Maria did to Puerto Rico. Almost 3,000 people died in the natural disaster, many more than the earlier official tally of 64 people. Trump said this week that his government’s response to the disaster in Puerto Rico “was an incredible, unsung success.”      Marc Caputo and Rebecca Morin contributed to this report.       ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the government's disaster relief agency says he has no intention of stepping aside, especially during Florence, despite being under investigation by a federal watchdog.      Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long says, \\"I'm here to serve my country every day. That's all I do. And when it's over, whenever it ends, I'm ready to go back home, love my family.\\"      Long says Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen (KEER'-sten) Nielsen \\"has never asked me to resign\\" from FEMA.      He says the two have a \\"very functional and professional relationship.\\"      On Thursday, Long said he never intentionally misused federal vehicles after news broke that DHS' inspector general was investigating him. Long has said he'll cooperate and own up to any mistakes.      Long spoke Sunday on NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\" and CBS' \\"Face the Nation.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"Brock Long, who is in charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is being investigated for possibly misusing government cars. He drove between his home in North Carolina and Washington D.C. many times, and people are wondering if taxpayers should have paid for his trips. This investigation comes at a time when FEMA is very busy helping people because of Hurricane Florence. Even though he's being investigated, Brock Long says he didn't do anything wrong on purpose and will still work hard to lead FEMA."},{"instruction":"Question: Here's a question: How would you start living life with someone else?  Here are possible answers to this question: - make love - get married - gone to jail - have children - learning  I believe the correct choice is \\"get married\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"\\"Get married\\" is the most fitting answer among the given options because it signifies the beginning of a lifelong partnership and commitment to living life with another person. Marriage is a formal union that allows the couple to start building a future together, making joint decisions, and truly sharing their lives. While the other options may also involve living life with someone else, they do not capture the essence of forming a partnership and sharing a life together in the same way that marriage does. For example: - Making love: While making love can certainly bring people closer, it does not necessarily imply a decision to live life together or a long-term commitment. - Going to jail: Going to jail and spending time with cellmates does involve living with someone else, but it is an involuntary situation and not comparable to a loving partnership. - Having children: Having children indeed creates a bond with another person for life, but it does not guarantee that the child's parents will live life together or be in a committed relationship. - Learning: Learning can be done with others in various contexts, such as in a school or a job, but it does not inherently involve living life together or forming a partnership. Thus, \\"get married\\" is the correct choice when considering how to start living life with someone else, as it represents a mutual commitment to sharing a life together in a long-term partnership."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trivia question: Polaris is the brightest star in which constellation? And the answer is?","output":"Polaris, also known as the North Star or Alpha Ursae Minoris, is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor, commonly referred to as the Little Bear. Ursa Minor is a relatively small constellation located in the northern celestial hemisphere, which also contains the famous asterism Little Dipper. This constellation is significant for both observational astronomy and celestial navigation. Polaris, a yellow supergiant, is a Cepheid variable star, meaning it undergoes regular pulsations that cause it to vary in brightness. It is located approximately 323 to 433 light-years away from Earth. Polaris has an apparent magnitude between 1.86 and 2.13, making it one of the brightest stars visible from Earth, although not the brightest overall. Ursa Minor is a circumpolar constellation for many observers in the Northern Hemisphere, meaning it never dips below the horizon, making it visible throughout the year for the latitudes above 40 degrees. Polaris' role as the North Star is of great importance for celestial navigation since it lies very close to the north celestial pole, around which all other stars in the Northern Hemisphere appear to revolve. Thus, when observers in the Northern Hemisphere locate Polaris, they can be confident that they are facing north. In ancient times, Polaris was used extensively by sailors for navigation at sea and played a significant role in the maritime history of several civilizations. To this day, it remains an essential guiding star for amateur stargazers and astronomers alike. In conclusion, Polaris is the brightest star in the Ursa Minor constellation. Its unique position and brightness make it a cornerstone in astronomy and celestial navigation for observers in the Northern Hemisphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"yeah i i i hope to never venture into something that drastic\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I hope I never do anything that serious.\\"? Choices: --yes --it is not possible to tell --no","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"yeah i i i hope to never venture into something that drastic,\\" it appears that the speaker is expressing a reluctance or desire to avoid engaging in activities or situations they perceive to be drastic. The term \\"drastic\\" here can be interpreted as something severe, extreme, or requiring significant effort or consequences. Now, let us examine the hypothesis, \\"I hope I never do anything that serious.\\" This statement also showcases the speaker's wish to abstain from participating in situations or actions that carry a significant level of seriousness or gravity. On comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes evident that they share a similarity in expressing the desire or hope to avoid extremely serious circumstances. The difference between the two statements lies in the choice of words—\\"drastic\\" in the premise and \\"serious\\" in the hypothesis. While \\"drastic\\" implies extreme or severe actions or situations, \\"serious\\" emphasizes the gravity or importance of the circumstances. Although the words \\"drastic\\" and \\"serious\\" carry slightly different nuances, they both convey an overall sense of extremity, severity, or importance. In this context, the premise of hoping to never venture into something drastic can be reasonably related to the hypothesis of hoping not to engage in anything too serious. While the premise does not explicitly prove the hypothesis, it is suggestive of a similar wish on the part of the speaker. Considering this analysis, the most suitable answer from the given options would be, \\"it is not possible to tell\\" if the premise explicitly entails the hypothesis. Nevertheless, the premise does indicate a similar sentiment, making it reasonable to assume that the speaker may share the hope expressed in the hypothesis as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

All these plants and bushes work together to make a happy place for insects, birds, and many other animals to live. Now, let's say we take away all the grasses and shrubs from this playground. Uh-oh! Here's what would most likely happen: 1. The animals, like birds and insects that used to live there, will lose their homes and food. They might have to go away to find new places to live, and that can be very hard for them. 2. The soil will also be sad without its grass and shrub friends. The roots from the plants used to hold the soil together like glue, but now, rain and wind might wash or blow the soil away more easily. This is called erosion. 3. Without all these little plants, other bigger plants and trees might have a harder time growing because they could also lose soil and important things in the soil they need to grow big and strong.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. James was born in Holton, Kansas; his mother, died in 1954 when he was five. His father was a janitor and a handyman. After four years at the University of Kansas residing at Stephenson Scholarship hall, James joined the Army in 1971. He was the last person in Kansas to be sent to fight in the Vietnam War, although he never saw action there. In his Baseball Book 1990, James heavily criticized the methodology of the Dowd Report, which was an investigation (commissioned by baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti) on the gambling activities of Pete Rose. James reproached commissioner Giamatti and his successor, Fay Vincent, for their acceptance of the Dowd Report as the final word on Rose's gambling. (James' attitude on the matter surprised many fans, especially after the writer had been deeply critical of Rose in the past, especially what James considered to be Rose's selfish pursuit of Ty Cobb's all-time record for base hits.)  James expanded his defense of Rose in his 2001 book The New Historical Baseball Abstract, with a detailed explanation of why he found the case against Rose flimsy. James wrote \\"I would characterize the evidence that Rose bet on baseball as...well, not quite non-existent. It is extremely weak.\\" This countered the popular opinion that the case against Rose was a slam dunk, and several critics claimed that James misstated some of the evidence in his defense of Rose. Derek Zumsteg of Baseball Prospectus wrote an exhaustive review of the case James made and concluded: \\"James' defense of Rose is filled with oversights, errors in judgment, failures in research, and is a great disservice to the many people who have looked to him for a balanced and fair take on this complicated and important issue.\\"  In 2004, Rose admitted publicly that he had bet on baseball and confirmed the Dowd Report was correct. James remained steadfast, continuing to insist that the evidence available to Dowd at the time was insufficient to reach the conclusion that it did. Why did he want to defend Rose?","output":"James wanted to defend Rose because he believed that the evidence against Rose was weak and not enough to prove that he had really bet on baseball. He felt that the Dowd Report's investigation wasn't thorough and reliable, so he tried to put forward his own analysis in support of Rose, even though many people didn't agree with him.

Empiricism The Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) responded to Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of skepticism. Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, \\"Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated.

The general approach to addressing the gap in each interview can be similar, but the specific explanations might need to be tailored to the respective industries. To answer these questions step-by-step: 1. Analyze your reasons for taking the 2-year gap. Consider what you were doing during that time and how it relates to the job you are interviewing for. Were you traveling, volunteering, learning a new skill, or focusing on personal or family issues? Understanding your reasons will make it easier to explain in the interview. 2. Emphasize any skills or experiences gained during the gap. Even if you were not employed during the gap, any skills or experiences you gained could be valuable to a potential employer. If you volunteered, learned a new language, or took any courses relevant to the job, mention these during the interview. 3. Be prepared to handle the interviewer's concerns.  Employers might be worried if the gap signals a lack of motivation, commitment, or the ability to hold a job. Address these concerns by explaining how the gap contributed positively to your personal or professional growth. 4. Tailor your answer to the specific interview. In the context of the RBI interview, focus on aspects of the gap that relate to the finance industry, such as financial skills, experience, or knowledge gained during that time. For the BPO interview, emphasize any customer service experience, problem-solving skills, or the ability to handle difficult situations that might have resulted from your time off. 5. Be honest and confident. Don't try to hide or downplay your gap. Be honest about your reasons and confident in how the time off contributed to your overall development.

Which farmer helped to stabilize the soil more?  Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's  farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops.  Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Gary, the farmer who started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops, has helped stabilize the soil more than Joe, who has a farm with depleted soil. From the hint, it is evident that depleted soils can benefit from the protection against soil erosion by groundcover plants found in agroforestry systems. Groundcover plants, such as naturally growing grasses, contribute to stabilizing the soil by providing increased cover as opposed to the cover found in short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a vital factor in preventing erosion. Agroforestry, which Gary has adopted, offers additional advantages such as cleaner water through the reduction of nutrient and soil surface runoff. This can be achieved by slowing down the velocity of runoff and increasing the infiltration of water into the soil. This method proves to be more effective than row-cropped fields, as it facilitates greater nutrient uptake and reduces nutrient loss into streams. In conclusion, Gary's practice of agroforestry and the growth of cover crops has resulted in healthier, more stable soil when compared to Joe's farm with depleted soil. The use of groundcover plants and the various advantages of agroforestry systems overall contribute to better soil stabilization and environmental benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Klinsmann Remains Critical of MLS As the brain trust of U.S. Soccer gathered here for the announcement of this summer’s Concacaf Gold Cup schedule, men’s national-team coach Jurgen Klinsmann took the opportunity to deliver a state-of-the-program presentation as the U.S. begins to focus on the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Much of Klinsmann’s talk here Wednesday evening centered on the challenges America’s top young players can face reaching the highest level when they choose to play in Major League Soccer instead of trying to break into the top leagues abroad. Klinsmann’s views of MLS as a league that doesn’t challenge the best American players sufficiently are well-known. Last fall, they sparked a public tête-à-tête with MLS commissioner Don Garber, who demanded that Klinsmann stop denigrating the U.S. league. That debate, however, centered largely on whether current members of the U.S. national team were taking the easy way out by accepting multimillion-dollar contracts to star in MLS instead of fighting for playing time in England, France and Germany. On Wednesday night in Philadelphia, Klinsmann seemed more concerned about younger players who, because of scheduling conflicts with MLS, might not even get to play in every game with the under-23 and under-20 national teams, since the MLS clubs aren’t required to release the players on days specified for international play, though occasionally they do. The issue is of critical importance this year because the under-23 team is trying to qualify for next year’s Rio Olympics. “Here we are a week or two away from games and Andi doesn’t know the players he will have,” Klinsmann said, referring to the under-23 coach Andreas Herzog, who is also his top assistant on the national team. The U-23 team will play in friendlies in Denmark and Bosnia-Herzegovina later this month. To Klinsmann, giving the younger players the chance to maximize their play on the junior national teams is essential if the U.S. ever wants to improve in the World Cup, where it hasn’t won a game in the knockout round since 2002, especially since some of the MLS players on the junior teams are reserve players for their clubs who struggle to get on the field. Playing for the junior national team at every opportunity would give them valuable competitive experience—as many as 15 extra games as well as practices with U.S. players at the highest level in their age group. This often isn’t an issue for European and South American leagues, where games usually don’t conflict with the FIFA dates. MLS, which Klinsmann recognizes has helped soccer development in the U.S. substantially, has to schedule games on many FIFA dates because many fall on weekends or in the summer months. MLS has learned the hard way that its fans don’t show up for midweek games, and due to the extreme North American winters, it plays a March-November schedule, while most of the rest of the world plays August-May. An MLS spokesman declined to comment. More troubling to Klinsmann though is that even the best MLS teams don’t play nearly as many games as the better European clubs. For instance, a top Premier League team in England will play close to 60 games in a season, counting its domestic and international tournaments. MLS champion LA Galaxy played just over 40 games last year in all competitions. Factor in national team games and a top MLS-based U.S. player may play roughly 80-90 games over the course of a two-year cycle whereas a top international reaches well over 100. To be sure, Klinsmann acknowledged, it does no one any good when a U.S. player signs with a European club then ends up on the bench, but all things being equal, maximizing the most intense competitive opportunities, whether at the club or junior national levels, is essential for improvement. “The most important thing is that the kid gets the chance to play,” Klinsmann said. To Klinsmann, the issue strikes at the heart of what ails U.S. soccer, which is what the public and U.S. Soccer demand of their very best players. What frustrates him the most he says, is that the players on the under-17 team can occasionally hold their own against some very good soccer nations. They beat England 3-1 in Florida in November. He said coaches rave to him about the quality of the teenage players then ask him what goes wrong as they become adults. “We don’t bridge the gap from 18-22,” he said, insisting that U.S. soccer needs to do a better job of getting players to understand how they need to live and train and work to reach the game’s highest level. Klinsmann said that he saw direct evidence of this in January when he convened a camp of 30 national team players from MLS, many of whom had been on vacation since their MLS seasons ended in November. In fitness tests, few met the national team’s standards, especially in the famed “beep test” which has players run back and forth between lines in a set period. They are expected to cover 3,200 meters. MLS players, notably Matt Besler, defended themselves saying they couldn’t be expected to be in peak condition in the middle of the off-season and were using the camp to get in shape for the March start of MLS. Klinsmann said Wednesday top international players play an 11-month season and continue to do light workouts during a four-week summer break. They don’t sit on a beach with a drink in hand. “If you take a month off it’s going to take you two months to get it back,” he said. Klinsmann, who is now also in charge of player development for U.S. Soccer, said he is in close contact with the best U.S. prospects and he expects plenty of new faces on his 2018 squad. He spoke with Jordan Morris, a talented sophomore at Stanford he called in for the recent match against the Czech Republic, about how he can get enough competition in 2015 to continue his development. He intervened in Hamburg, where Julian Green, the 19-year-old German-American who scored in the World Cup, became embroiled in a dispute with the club’s manager, who put Green on the reserve squad and asked him to prove his value to the top team. He has his sights set on Gedion Zelalem, the 18-year-old with Arsenal born in Germany to Ethiopian parents who immigrated to the U.S. as a child and is in the process of becoming eligible play for the men’s national team. Klinsmann said Zelalem is already good enough to play for the U.S. Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com","output":"Men's national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann voiced concerns about young American soccer players choosing to play in Major League Soccer instead of top leagues abroad, stating that it doesn't challenge the best players enough.

Article: After a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former Confederacy following the Reconstruction Era, and bans on interracial marriage in various parts of the country, more people are openly forming interracial unions. In addition, social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to \\"pass\\" as white. Diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the United States, such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos. Since the 1980s, the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement (cf. Loving Day). Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins, the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial. In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African American. Question: What is the effect of there no longer being a stigma on interracial marriage?","output":"The effect of there no longer being a stigma on interracial marriage includes an increase in the number of people openly forming interracial unions and the development of a diverse society reflecting a broad range of ethno-racial backgrounds. The elimination of this stigma has also contributed to a growing multiracial identity movement since the 1980s, with more people recognizing and embracing their mixed racial origins. This change in societal attitudes has led to significant milestones, such as the inclusion of multiple ethno-racial identity options in the 2000 U.S. Census and the election of Barack Obama as the first multiracial President of the United States in 2008. Overall, the decrease in stigma surrounding interracial marriage has fostered a more inclusive, diverse, and tolerant society."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.  Keith was reading a book on climate. He found an interesting table that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two different times, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's climatic condition in the previous century.

You may feel lightheaded, weak, have a stomach cramp, or a headache. Take deep breaths, do a little stretching, and make sure you stay hydrated. As time passes, these symptoms will fade, along with your embarrassment. If the issue is the result of a group message gone awry, staying a member of the group may only make the situation worse.

Click the wheel icon (desktop) or the arrow icon (Messenger) at the top right corner of the message. Select “Leave Conversation” (on all platform). A notification will be sent to the others that you have left the conversation, and you won't receive any further messages. Having to look at something hurtful over and over again isn’t good for anyone. If you wince in pain every time you see the harmful message in your inbox, you can archive the message.

He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer .  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002.  - The Long Beach Dub Allstars are a dub/ska/rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later.  - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs.
