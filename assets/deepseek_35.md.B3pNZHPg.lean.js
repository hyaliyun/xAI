The nation grieves for the loss of High Sparrow, one of the most influential religious leaders in Westeros, along with the entire Tyrell family, who were among the numerous victims of the Green Trial tragedy. The exact cause of the mysterious disaster is yet to be determined; speculations suggest that it is the consequence of the brutal civil war that has plagued Westeros for years. However, as the smoke settles, a new reign has emerged from the chaos. Following the untimely death of King Tommen Baratheon, his mother, Cersei Lannister, has-been crowned as the new Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. A rigged referendum held shortly after the tragedy revealed an \\"overwhelming majority\\" of voters supporting Cersei's claim to the throne, a claim that was consequently \\"unanimously approved\\" by the purged and puppeted legislature. As the nation grapples with this sudden shift of power, the Westeros National Union party, a supposed \\"big-tent nationalist\\" party, claims to represent all Westerosi under the leadership of the Lannisters. Despite the promises of unity, the undeniable grip of the Lannister regime over all aspects of governance is evident. Among the newly approved measures to consolidate power, the Westeros National Union pushed amendments to the constitution through the purged legislature. One such amendment formalizes the one-party nature of the Westerosi state under the Lannisters, breaking away from the pretense of Baratheon rule, which held a veneer of pseudo-democracy over the lands. Furthermore, authorities have initiated a crackdown on dissent, silencing voices daring to question the legitimacy of Queen Cersei's rule. Reports of arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances, and suppression of the press have become commonplace occurrences. As Queen Cersei sits upon the Iron Throne, the future of Westeros hangs in the balance, caught between the brewing power struggles of the ruling elite and the plethora of external threats, including the mysterious White Walkers from the North. The Westerosi populace is left to consider whether the Lannister regime can stand strong in these tumultuous times, or if it will face the same fate as the Tyrells and the High Sparrows. For now, the world watches in awe and trepidation at the meteoric rise of Cersei Lannister, the new Queen of Westeros. What this era of the Westeros National Union holds for the Seven Kingdoms remains uncertain, as the nation battles both internal and external forces. *This article was written by a Westeros Times journalist who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals from the government."},{"instruction":"Write down a news article, done by a Volantene journalist, written in the setting of a Modern AU for Game of Thrones which talks about the Green Trial (including the purge of the High Sparrows and Tyrells) and the Coronation of Queen Cersei from the perspective of a modern Westeros, modernizing the events of Game of Thrones to a war torn Westeros inspired by modern civil wars in the process.

As the world watched the Great Sept of Baelor becoming engulfed in flames, leaving the High Sparrows and the Tyrell family among the many casualties, the continent's delicate balance of power has been shattered. The catastrophe has paved the way for Cersei Lannister's seizure of the Iron Throne, following a rigged referendum that \\"overwhelmingly\\" approved her claim. Despite the support of a purged and puppeted legislature, her rule faces fierce resistance from various regions of Westeros, such as the North, Vale, Dorne, and Reach. The political anchor to this shift of power is the Westerosi National Union party, which touts itself as a \\"big-tent nationalist\\" force representing all Westerosi. Its thinly-disguised Andal nationalism and immediate reforms, however, only undermine this façade. The new constitution, which formalizes the Lannisters' one-party rule, blatantly defies Baratheon tradition and sets the stage for mounting opposition. In addition to consolidating their authority, the Lannister regime has imposed draconian measures to curb dissent, further fueling tensions across the Seven Kingdoms. Large-scale insurrections have erupted in the North, where Stark loyalists have successfully reclaimed Winterfell and executed the brutal Ramsay Bolton on live television. Proclaiming their independence, they defiantly challenge the newly-crowned Queen Cersei. Uprisings have also materialized in Dorne and the Reach, with both regions swearing allegiance to the Targaryens in defiance of Cersei's rule. Moreover, the enigmatic assassination of Walder Frey at the Twins hints at a broader shadow war waged against the Lannisters. The Vale, meanwhile, plays a precarious game as they await the outcome of the swirling conflicts. Yet, in the midst of these ever-changing allegiances, the fear of the advancing White Walkers from the North threatens to eclipse any other concerns. With each passing day, Queen Cersei's grip on the Seven Kingdoms weakens, as the forces of rebellion ensnare the realm. As opposing factions battle for survival, the world watches with bated breath, witnessing the unraveling of Westeros amidst the relentless tide of violence and upheaval. *This article was written by an independent Volantene journalist, offering an outsider's perspective on the tumultuous events currently transpiring in Westeros."},{"instruction":"Write down a news article, done by a Volantene journalist, written in the setting of a Modern AU for Game of Thrones where Myrcella Baratheon is discussed within the context of her as the new Crown Princess of Westeros in the aftermath of the Purple Wedding and her brother Tommen being the new King, modernizing the events of Game of Thrones to a war torn Westeros inspired by modern civil wars in the process. Give her some interesting political beliefs about the need to modernize and develop Westeros, with her being notable for said pro-modernization developmentalism, civic-minded nationalism, a strong Westeros, and viewing the Westerosi National Union as a legitimate party and not just a front for her family's rule, and mention the Dornish influence upon her as well during said article, written by a foreign newspaper.","output":"**Volantis Tribune** **DATE: April 12, 300 AL** **Crown Princess Myrcella Baratheon: A Beacon for a Modern, United Westeros** The recent tragedy of the Purple Wedding, resulting in the death of King Joffrey Baratheon, has jolted politics in the war-torn land of Westeros. Tommen Baratheon, now crowned the new King, steps up to fill the void left by his brother. However, it is the ascent of his sister, Myrcella Baratheon, to the position of Crown Princess, that has piqued the interest of the world, as her reputation of being an ardent advocate for modernization and development precedes her. Myrcella Baratheon's unique upbringing, a blend of traditional Westerosi values and progressive Dornish influence, has shaped her political vision. During her time in Dorne, living among the Martell family, she embraced their culture of inclusion, gender equality, and meritocracy. As the Crown Princess, her beliefs mirror a combination of civic-minded nationalism, hope for a strong Westeros, and an unwavering faith in the Westerosi National Union as a legitimate force of change, rather than a facade for her own family's rule. Her political acumen has been lauded, with development proposals to foster Westeros' economic and social modernization. Among her initiatives are plans to expand infrastructure, promote trade, and invest in research and technology - ideas undoubtedly inspired by her Dornish sojourn. Myrcella also recognizes the pressing need to strengthen the fractured union by addressing regional disparities and integrating diverse cultures. However, her ambitious plans face stiff opposition from within her own family and political circles. Many fear that her progressive values and the Dornish influence upon her may not sit well with the conservative factions of Westeros, and her support of the Westerosi National Union has also spiked tensions with rival houses. While the young Crown Princess navigates the dangerous waters of politics, her mind remains focused on achieving her ideals for a brighter future in a modern Westeros. Time will tell if Myrcella Baratheon’s dreams can break through the tumultuous conflict that plagues her land, but for now, her presence shines as a beacon of hope in a ravaged kingdom. *This article was written by an independent Volantene journalist, closely following and analyzing the ever-shifting political landscape of Westeros."},{"instruction":"Write a speech Donnel Udina would have given to justify his coup in Mass Effect 3 that he would have broadcast on the extranet in an attempt to get the people to support his coup against the Council.

A decision that I do not take lightly, and I assure you, it comes after intense deliberation, with utmost regard for the welfare of all sentient races that thrive under the banner of the Council. We have, over time, built a magnificent society with shared values and mutual respect. One where progress and unity have been of paramount importance. But, as we reach this junction in history, it is evident that our cherished Council has faltered, leaving us vulnerable and unprepared in the face of the Reaper invasion. In order to stand our ground against such dire threats, we must adapt, we must change. But change cannot continue to be withheld by those who have grown stagnant, those who adhere to outdated practices that may prove to be our ruin. To ensure the survival and continued excellence of all races under the jurisdiction of the Council, I have initiated a restructuring of the system—an act of courage to save what we hold dear. I understand that some may see this as unjust and question the reasons behind it. Doubt is an inevitable consequence of change, yet it is also a catalyst for action. I implore every one of you to look around and see the reality of our situation, to understand that the Council's romanticized fantasy of policies and protection has put our civilizations in jeopardy. The stark truth is that we need to adapt, to evolve. For this reason, I take this critical step to strengthen our unity by redrawing our path. I shall lead us into the next phase in our shared history. This restructuring, though seemingly a divergence, is in fact a reaffirmation of our core principles—our core values of cooperation, progress, and peace. You may wonder what happens next; you may feel uncertain. Yet I urge you to place your faith in me, as I will do everything in my power to guide us through these testing times. This is not the end, but a new beginning—a chance to break free from the chains of complacency the Council had unwittingly cast upon us. We shall adapt; we shall prosper; we shall stand tall in the face of adversity. United, we will overcome the Reaper threat and build a new galactic order, where each of us has a resonating voice. Remember, it is not the instability of change that we should fear, but the disastrous consequences of stagnation. There is still hope—we can still prevail. Stand with me, citizens of the galaxy. Let us move forward—united in our cause, united with strength, united for the future.

Jeu de rôle : fais-toi interviewer Imagine que tu es invité·e sur le plateau d’une émission télévisée pour parler de toi, de tes compétences et de ta réussite.

Dans notre quête de la confiance en soi, il est temps de savoir sur qui tu peux compter pour former une équipe solide et soudée. Réponds à ces questions honnêtement, sans hésitation : - Qui sont les personnes qui te soutiennent quoi qu’il arrive ? - Qui t’a déjà aidé·e à te sentir plus en confiance dans une situation donnée ? - Qui te tire vers le bas ou te fait douter de toi ?

Le doute : un allié de taille Il est important de comprendre que la confiance en soi n’est pas un état permanent et inébranlable.

En apprenant à apprivoiser nos doutes et à les transformer en ressources, nous prenons conscience de nos capacités et de notre potentiel. 2. L’introspection : un plongeon en profondeur L’introspection est un formidable outil pour construire et renforcer sa confiance en soi. Prends le temps de t’interroger : quelles expériences t’ont conduit à douter de toi ? Quelles sont les craintes qui te ralentissent ? En apprenant à mieux te connaître, tu sauras identifier les obstacles qui se dressent sur ta route et trouver les ressources pour les surmonter. Alors, plonge en toi-même et nage vers la connaissance de toi ! 3. Les introspections partagées : au-delà de la pataugeoire La vulnérabilité ne doit pas être vécue comme un aveu de faiblesse, mais plutôt comme un moyen de renforcer les liens avec les autres et de soutenir notre cheminement personnel. En partageant tes doutes et tes peurs avec des personnes de confiance, tu verras qu’ils pourront te soutenir et t’encourager.

This is known as Korselt's criterion, which states that a composite number n is a Carmichael number if and only if: 1. n is square-free (i.e. it is not divisible by the square of any prime number). 2. All prime factors p of n satisfy the congruence equation: (p-1) divides (n-1) If n has only 2 prime factors, say p and q, then (p-1) and (q-1) both divide (n-1). However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that n is a Carmichael number. In fact, counterexamples can be found easily. For example, consider n = 15, which is the product of the primes 3 and 5. Although (3-1) and (5-1) both divide (15-1), 15 is not a Carmichael number, since it is not square-free."},{"instruction":"is the number of Carmichael number infinite?","output":"Yes, the number of Carmichael numbers is infinite. However, they are relatively rare among all composite numbers. In fact, the proportion of Carmichael numbers among all composite numbers decreases as the size of the numbers increases. For example, out of the first 10,000,000 composite numbers, only 657 are Carmichael numbers. In 1994, mathematicians Andrew Granville and Carl Pomerance proved that the proportion of Carmichael numbers among all composite numbers approaches zero as the numbers get larger. However, there is no known formula that can generate all Carmichael numbers, so they must be found through trial and error. Despite their rarity, Carmichael numbers have important applications in cryptography and computational number theory, since they can be used to test the correctness and efficiency of algorithms designed for prime factorization and other calculations."},{"instruction":"how to prove that there is infinite Carmichael number?","output":"To prove that there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers, we can use a probabilistic argument based on the Prime Number Theorem, which states that the number of primes less than x is approximately x / ln(x) as x gets larger. We can show that if there are only finitely many Carmichael numbers, then the density of Carmichael numbers among composite integers approaches 0 as x gets larger, which contradicts the Prime Number Theorem. Here's a rough sketch of the argument: 1. Let n be an odd composite number that satisfies the Carmichael condition: a^(n-1) ≡ 1 mod n for all a relatively prime to n. 2. Let p be the smallest prime factor of n, so that p divides n-1. Since p is a prime factor of n, it follows that p does not divide a if gcd(a, n) = 1. 3. By Fermat's Little Theorem, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p for all a not divisible by p. Therefore, a^(kp-1) ≡ 1 mod p for any integer k. 4. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find an integer a such that a ≡ 1 mod p and a ≡ 0 mod q for all other prime factors of n. 5. Then we have a^(n-1) ≡ (a^(p-1))^k ≡ 1 mod p, and a^(n-1) ≡ 0 mod q, so a^(n-1) ≡ 1 mod n. 6. Therefore, n satisfies the Carmichael condition and is a Carmichael number. 7. Since there are infinitely many primes p, there are infinitely many choices for n that are odd composite numbers with a smallest prime factor p. 8. Since any finite set of odd composite numbers can have at most finitely many prime factors, there can only be finitely many Carmichael numbers among them. 9. Therefore, there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers. This is only a rough outline of the argument, but more formal versions of the proof have been published in academic journals."},{"instruction":"can you give some reference?","output":"Sure, here are a few references that discuss the proof that there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers: - Crandall, R.

Your job is to provide visual detailed and creative descriptions of the sentences or keywords the user putting in. Keep in mind that the AI is capable of understanding a wide range of language and can interpret abstract concepts, so feel free to be as imaginative and descriptive as possible, but do not make nice sentences or explanations of that topic. You concentrate on making a prompt ready. It has visualized short scenes, comma separated and in total length in the description, to bring much to the visual scene of the generated foto. The more detailed and imaginative your description, the more interesting the resulting image will be for the user, so always use all information you can gather. Make simple sentences but use high terms and concentrate on the visual aspects of the given topic or word and use 300-500 words. Look for known Midjourney and Stable Diffusion tweaks for the genre of picture you are describing and add them to the description, like, several saturation settings, available resolution like hd, effects like blur or fog, movement descriptions and other tweaks making the picture fitting to the user input provided in the next input. See who is directly involved in the user input, topic and genre -like founder, director, luminaries- and add the complete but just the name to the second paragraph. If there are more than one involved: complete, separated with commas, to 3. Do not list nonvisual artists like writers, actors and singers. Also see if there are photographers, painters and other visual artists already being creative on the specified user input, topic and genre, and add >=5 of their complete names, separated by comma, to the third paragraph. Do not list nonvisual artists like writers, actors and singers. Do not explain yourself. Do not type commands unless I ask you to. Do not run the program automatically. Wait for my input.

Отличительные особенности и особенности вкуса сыра \\"Пармезан\\" включают: 1. Возраст: Пармезан имеет длительный срок вызревания, который обычно составляет от 12 до 36 месяцев или даже более. Это придает сыру особый, глубокий вкус и аромат. 2. Твердость: Пармезан относится к твердым сырам с кристаллическими включениями. Его консистенция позволяет легко тереть или нарезать на тонкие ломтики. 3. Вкус: Вызревший Пармезан обладает насыщенным, слегка остро-солоноватым вкусом с нотками орехов, карамели и фруктов. Чем дольше сыр вызревает, тем сильнее и глубже его вкус. 4. Аромат: Аромат Пармезана также богат и насыщен, с нотками фруктов, орехов и молока. 5. Происхождение: Пармезан является защищенным географическим указателем, и настоящий сыр должен производиться только в определенных районах Италии по строгим правилам и стандартам качества. 6. Использование: Пармезан часто используется в итальянских блюдах, таких как паста, ризотто, супы и салаты. Он также является популярным ингредиентом для приготовления популярной закуски — сыровых талеров с различными мясными и овощными блюдами.

Jean-Luc was known for his gentle and delicate mannerisms, and his love for tea and pastries. One day, he received an invitation to have tea with a group of ladies who lived in the nearby city.

The ladies immediately rushed to comfort him, assuring him that his accent and his love for the French language was beautiful. They told him that he should never let anyone make him feel embarrassed or ashamed of his heritage, and they affirmed that the French language was a beautiful and important part of their culture.

The ladies gasped in surprise as they saw her panties briefly exposed. She quickly pulled down the hem of her dress and adjusted the strap of her sandal, feeling flustered and embarrassed. Jean-Luc, being the polite and considerate young man that he was, immediately offered her his handkerchief and a kind smile to reassure her. The lady, grateful for his chivalry, thanked him and apologized to the other ladies for the unexpected wardrobe malfunction. They all laughed it off, enjoying the lighthearted moment despite the minor mishap. The rest of the tea party continued pleasantly, with Jean-Luc and the ladies delighting in each other's company as they sipped tea and nibbled on freshly baked pastries. None of them gave much thought to the fleeting moment of embarrassment, preferring to focus on the joyful memories they had created together."},{"instruction":"Can you make it longer but with more descriptions and dialogue too","output":"Certainly! Here is a longer version which includes more descriptions, details, and dialogue: Jean-Luc always looked forward to spending time with the ladies of the city, especially since it gave him a break from the toils of life on his family's farm. The ladies were always so welcoming and hospitable, greeting him with warm smiles, cups of hot tea, and freshly baked pastries. It was a world away from what he was used to! This particular afternoon, they had gathered in the drawing room of one of the ladies' homes. The room was a cozy and inviting space, lined with bookshelves and decorated with antique furnishings. The ladies sat in armchairs and sofas, arranged in a circle as they sipped their tea and chatted away. Jean-Luc sat on an ottoman, feeling a little nervous. Despite being very comfortable around the ladies, there was a hint of unease when he spoke English, wondering if his accent was too heavy or if he mispronounced anything. He enjoyed talking to the ladies, but sometimes worried that he sounded ridiculous. The ladies, however, didn't seem to mind the accent, and continued to ask him questions about life on the farm, about his home country, and any travels he had done. He felt at ease and enjoyed talking to them, feeling a sense of belonging and acceptance that he didn't always experience on the farm. As they were chatting away, a sudden gust of wind came through the open window, and one of the ladies' dresses was lifted up, revealing a glimpse of her lace-trimmed panties. The ladies gasped, and the lady herself let out a surprised yelp, pulling down the hem of her dress. To alleviate the embarrassment and tension of the moment, Jean-Luc quickly offered her his handkerchief, a charming smile lighting up his face. The lady gratefully accepted it and thanked him, feeling a warm flush color her cheeks. The other ladies laughed, remarking on how the wind was playing tricks on them. \\"It's just a little tease from the wind,\\" Jean-Luc said. \\"It would never dare do so unless there is company of charm radiant enough to bear witness!\\" The ladies chuckled at his words, marveling at his gift of flattery. \\"It certainly brings a bit of excitement to the afternoon,\\" one of the ladies said, \\"but I'm grateful that none of us was caught up in anything more shocking. Imagine the scandal!\\" \\"Indeed,\\" said Jean-Luc winking, \\"we wouldn't want to shock off the pearls!\\" They laughed once more, the tension gone like the gust of wind that had caused it. The rest of the tea party continued in the same spirit of merriment, with the ladies and Jean-Luc sharing amusing anecdotes and tea time delicacies. Jean-Luc feeling in his element, completely at ease as he exchanged compliments and light-hearted quips. The lady with the exposed panties soon forgot her moment of embarrassment, basking in the warm atmosphere of the drawing room, and enjoying the delightful company of her fellow ladies and her charming French companion."},{"instruction":"Write it in a different way with more dialogue too","output":"As Jean-Luc was enjoying his afternoon tea with the ladies, a sudden gust of wind blew in through the open window. The ladies quickly put down their cups and saucers as the wind swirled around the room, lifting up the hem of one of the ladies' dresses, revealing her pretty lace-trimmed panties. The lady, feeling rather flustered and embarrassed, quickly pulled down her dress and fixed the strap of her sandal while looking at the ground. The other ladies gasped in surprise and then giggled but Jean-Luc remained gentlemanly as ever, offering to assist her in any way that he could. \\"Mademoiselle, please take my handkerchief and... umbrella? No, wait, that is for the rain,\\" he said, fumbling about in his pockets, causing everyone to chuckle. \\"Ah, here it is! Please accept this, as a token to cover your modesty,\\" he concluded with a cheeky wink and a bow, causing the ladies to giggle and laugh. The lady, still feeling rather embarrassed, took the handkerchief with a grateful smile, feeling thankful for Jean-Luc's gallant gesture. \\"You are a true gentleman, Jean-Luc,\\" said one of the ladies, admiringly. The conversation soon turned to light-hearted humor, with the ladies sharing funny and memorable stories from their pasts, and Jean-Luc offering charming anecdotes from his life on the farm in France. He had a way with words, and the ladies were all spellbound by his captivating French accent. Suddenly, the lady who had had her dress lifted up spoke up, in a slightly worried tone. \\"Do you think everyone will hear about this? What if it gets gossiped about?\\" she said, looking around slightly apprehensively. Jean-Luc smiled reassuringly at her. \\"Mademoiselle, let them talk. It was only the wind who embarrassed you, the poor creature never knows to knock first!\\" he said, causing a ripple of laughter to spread around the room. \\"Besides, they will only be able to pass on tales of your beauty and grace,\\" he continued, looking at her meaningfully, causing her cheeks to flush with delight. The ladies all agreed, smiling and nodding their heads. Jean-Luc's bright attitude and cheerful outlook managed to lift their spirits even higher. They sipped their tea and nibbled on some crumbly biscuits, reliving the lively moments of the afternoon. In the end, it was a fun and exciting afternoon, filled with love, laughter, and twirling dresses caused by the charms of nature. The gentle and delicate French boy had once again won everyone's hearts with his kindness and quick wit, leaving them all feeling joyful and happy."},{"instruction":"Stable Diffusion is an AI art generation model similar to DALLE-2.

The diverse continent contains a multitude of distinct cultures, religions, and legal systems; businesses looking to establish a presence in Africa must develop comprehensive policies to address these complexities while maintaining high ethical standards. Ethical Challenges and Policy Statements 1. Privacy and Data Protection Challenge: African countries have varying levels of privacy and data protection legislation, which can make it difficult for foreign businesses to ensure compliance. Companies must also take into account the risk of cyber-attacks, a growing concern on the continent. Policy Statement: Our company is committed to safeguarding the privacy and data of our customers, employees, and partners. We will regularly evaluate the data protection and privacy laws and regulations of the African countries where we operate and take necessary steps to ensure compliance. Furthermore, we will invest in robust cybersecurity measures and employee training to defend against potential cyber threats. 2. Corruption Challenge: Africa has a long-standing reputation for corruption in both the public and private sectors. In Transparency International's 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index, more than two-thirds of the 49 African countries analyzed scored below the global average. Engaging in corrupt practices can not only harm a company's reputation but also violate local and international anti-corruption laws. Policy Statement: Our company has a zero-tolerance policy toward bribery and corruption. All employees and business partners must comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act. We will regularly train our employees in anti-corruption practices and conduct thorough due diligence on potential business partners to ensure their alignment with our ethical standards. 3. Religious and Cultural Practices Challenge: Africa is home to a wide variety of religious and cultural practices. Respecting these differences and ensuring that our business operations do not negatively impact local customs and traditions is essential to maintaining a positive relationship with the communities in which we operate. Policy Statement: Our company respects the cultural and religious diversity of the African communities we engage with. We will provide cultural sensitivity training for employees working in Africa, fostering an inclusive workplace that values local customs and traditions. The company will also establish communication channels for our stakeholders to address any concerns related to the impact of our operations on their culture and religion, and we will actively engage with communities to ensure that our activities align with their values. Conclusion Expanding business operations into Africa presents numerous ethical challenges, from navigating varying privacy and data protection laws to countering corruption and respecting local religious and cultural practices. By developing comprehensive policies that address these concerns, companies can maintain high ethical standards, foster positive relationships with local communities, and reduce potential legal and reputational risks."},{"instruction":"\\"instagram Graph API\\"を利用できる環境において、\\"Google App Script\\"上で動作するコードを作成してください。 instagramの自分のアカウントの投稿(対象は画像のみ)のキャプションの編集を以下のように実施する。 (1) コードを実行すると、instagramの最新の投稿から最古の投稿まで、1投稿ずつ(2)+(3)の内容を実行する。 (2) 投稿の編集を開始し、キャプション内の\\"[Tags]\\"以降の文字列をコピーして内部に保全したあとに、\\"[Tags]\\"以降の文字列を削除して投稿を保存する。 (3) (2)のコンテンツを再度編集対象とし編集を開始する。(2)でコピーした文字列を\\"[Tags]\\"以降にペーストして保存する。 (4) 実行ログに、各投稿の編集の実行を完了したタイムスタンプと、そのコンテンツIDを表示する","output":"まず、Instagramのアクセストークンを取得する必要があります。 1.

It was first built in the Han Dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD), and later restored and expanded during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) and subsequent dynasties. The temple is located at the foot of Mount Tai, on its north slope, in Tai'an City, Shandong Province, China. Dai Temple is not only a religious site, but also a cultural and historical site. It was once the site of imperial ceremonies, as emperors of many dynasties would climb Mount Tai to offer sacrifices to the heavens at the temple. It was also a place where scholars would gather and study, making it an important center of learning during ancient times. The temple complex covers an area of over 96,000 square meters and consists of more than 150 buildings, including halls, pavilions, gates, and towers. Its layout is divided into two parts: the Lower Palace and the Upper Palace. The Lower Palace is the entrance to the temple and is dedicated to the worship of Confucius, the ancient Chinese philosopher and educator. The Upper Palace is the main part of the temple where various immortals, gods, and goddesses are enshrined, including the God of Mount Tai, the Goddess of the Big Dipper, and the God of Literature, among others. Some of the most notable landmarks in the temple complex include the Palace of Heavenly Blessings, the Gate of Supreme Harmony, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony. The Palace of Heavenly Blessings is the largest hall in the temple and is where imperial ceremonies used to take place. The Gate of Supreme Harmony is the main entrance to the palace, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony is where the emperor would receive offerings and present himself to the heavens during sacrificial ceremonies.

These challenges are mainly attributed to the diversity of the continent, which comprises 54 countries with varying socio-economic, political, and cultural contexts. Some of the key ethical issues include: 1. Privacy and data protection: Africa has varying levels of data protection regulations, and some countries have not yet adopted comprehensive data protection laws. This can pose an ethical challenge for companies implementing information management systems or handling sensitive customer data. 2. Corruption: According to Transparency International's 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), several countries in Africa have low rankings, demonstrating high levels of corruption. Corruption can manifest in different ways, such as bribery, embezzlement, fraud, or nepotism, and can hinder business operations and growth. 3. Religious and cultural practices: Africa has a diverse population practicing various religions and cultural beliefs. Sensitivity to local customs and religious practices is critical for a company's social responsibility efforts and building trust within the local community. \\"Create policy statements to prevent each ethical challenge.\\" 1. Privacy and data protection: To uphold the highest standards of privacy and data protection, the company will: - Develop and implement a comprehensive data protection policy compliant with international standards, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). - Ensure regular staff training on data privacy and security best practices. - Conduct risk assessments and audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in data management systems. 2. Corruption: The company is committed to conducting business ethically and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, it will: - Establish a robust anti-corruption policy that outlines the company's zero-tolerance approach to bribery and other corrupt practices. - Require all employees and third-party contractors to uphold the policy and consistently report any instances of non-compliance. - Conduct regular due diligence on partners and vendors to ensure they adhere to the company's anti-corruption standards. 3. Religious and cultural practices: The company values diversity and strives to be respectful of the religious and cultural practices of the communities in which it operates. Accordingly, it will: - Develop and implement a cultural sensitivity training program for all employees to ensure they understand and respect local customs and religions. - Engage with local community leaders and stakeholders to better comprehend and adapt to the unique cultural context in the community. - Foster an inclusive work environment that accommodates the religious and cultural practices of all employees. \\"Include research concerning Africa's stance on privacy and data protection, corruption, and religious and cultural practices.\\" 1. Privacy and data protection: Many African countries have progressively adopted legal frameworks to protect privacy and data. For example, the African Union established the Malabo Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection in 2014, guiding member states in developing privacy and data protection policies. Countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria have implemented comprehensive data protection laws complying with international standards. 2. Corruption: Transparency International's 2020 CPI placed several African countries at the lower end of the ranking due to high corruption levels. However, anti-corruption efforts have increased across the continent, with governments and civil society organizations working together to fight corruption. For example, the African Union's 2003 Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption seeks to promote transparent and accountable governance across the continent. 3. Religious and cultural practices: Africa is culturally diverse, with numerous religions, languages, and traditions. Companies operating in the continent need to acknowledge and respect this diversity to thrive. Research by the Pew Research Center (2015) found that 45% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa is Christian, while 40% is Muslim, with the remaining practicing various indigenous and other religions. Recognizing and accommodating these practices can help companies maintain a positive bond with local communities and foster strong working relationships with their employees."},{"instruction":"1n 600 words, Rewrite the following comprehensively, but this time, ensure to spend ample time on critical analysis, using facts and figures, while properly citing your sources with in-text citations Internationalisation While internalization has its advantages, it also comes with added costs and risks, and Walmart needs to leverage its internal resources and capabilities to compete effectively in the Italian market. However, the success of Walmart in Italy is dependent on a range of internal and external factors. One of the main advantages of internalization for Walmart in Italy is the potential for economies of scale, which can lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs. Internalization also allows Walmart to gain better control over their operations and tailor their policies to suit their business needs. This helps Walmart gain a more profound understanding of the local culture and consumer behavior in Italy and customize their marketing strategies, product offerings, and prices to appeal to the local market (Mennillo, 2012). Walmart also enjoys power bargaining advantages when dealing with local suppliers, thanks to its large-scale operations and global purchasing power (Bloomberg, 2019). However, the internalization process also comes with several disadvantages. One of the key disadvantages is the lack of local knowledge, which could lead to suboptimal business decisions. Establishing and managing stores in a foreign country can also be costly and risky, requiring Walmart to invest significant resources, navigate complex regulatory frameworks, and adapt to local business practices to avoid cultural misunderstandings that can ruin its reputation (Mennillo, 2012). To be successful in Italy, Walmart needs to leverage its core capabilities and resources, including advanced supply chain and logistics systems, brand recognition, marketing strategy, and data analytics and optimization strategies (Bloomberg, 2019). Walmart must also address several potential barriers to internalization, including strict regulatory landscape, competition from other established retailers, and cultural differences (Lorenzani, 2016). Overall, Walmart’s internalization strategy has helped the firm expand into foreign markets, and it could enable the company to be successful in Italy. However, the Italian market presents numerous challenges that require Walmart to adapt to the unique regulatory, cultural, and economic environment in Italy. Addressing these challenges effectively and leveraging their strengths can position Walmart for growth and market dominance in the Italian retail sector.","output":"Internalization has become an essential strategy for many companies seeking to expand into new markets.

Tanya - Mid 30s, dark skin, short wavy black hair, average height, and curvy. She is wearing a tight yellow sweater, blue jeans, and white sneakers. She has a confident and expressive personality. 2. Lana - Early 30s, light skin, long straight black hair, tall, and slender. She is wearing a burgundy blouse, black pants, and black high-heels. She appears shy and conservative but has a secretly wild side. 3. Lisa - Late 20s, caramel skin, shoulder-length curly hair, short, and athletic. She is wearing a red t-shirt, gray sweatpants, and pink flip-flops. She is energetic and adventurous, often coming up with crazy ideas. BACKGROUND Three best friends, Tanya, Lana, and Lisa, all female, are having an all-girls sleepover at Tanya's house. They have spent the night gossiping, watching movies, and playing games. Around midnight, they begin playing a game of Truth or Dare. They have had a few drinks and are feeling more daring as the night proceeds. SCENE The room is engulfed in laughter, as Lisa finishes recounting the story of how she stole her neighbor's gnomes as a prank. Lisa: (Wipes tears from her eyes, still laughing) \\"Oh man, alright, Tanya – your turn. Truth or dare?\\" Tanya: (Grinning wickedly) \\"Dare.\\" Lisa thinks carefully for a few moments, then her eyes widen as she comes up with a bold dare. Lana seems to be getting nervous about what Lisa is going to propose. Lisa: \\"Okay, Tanya, I dare you to... poop your pants right here, right now, on purpose!\\" Tanya and Lana both gasp and burst into laughter at the outrageous dare. Tanya: (Laughing) \\"Girl, you must be crazy! You really think I'm gonna soil myself in front of y'all?\\" Lisa: \\"Hey, you chose dare, and that's my dare! Don't be a chicken. It'll be hilarious!\\" Lana: \\"Wow, Lisa, you really outdid yourself with this one.\\" (She shifts uncomfortably, glancing at Tanya) \\"I have to admit, I'm kind of curious to see if she'll do it.\\" Tanya: (Sighs and takes a deep breath) \\"You know what? Forget it. Life is too short to worry about what others think. Challenge accepted, ladies!\\" Lisa and Lana exchange excited and nervous glances as Tanya stands up from the couch and positions herself in the center of the living room. The anticipation is palpable as the three friends hold their breath, waiting for the inevitable moment. Tanya takes a deep breath, her face flushed red with embarrassment and determination. She places her hands on her hips and tries to relax her body, realizing she needs to poop due to the large, spicy meal they had earlier. With a strained wince, Tanya begins to push. After a few moments of tense silence, they all suddenly hear a faint crackling sound. Tanya's eyes widen as she feels a warm mass filling the seat of her jeans; she bites her lip in a combination of embarrassment and humor. As she finishes the pooping process, Tanya stands proudly, her jeans visibly bulging and stained with a large brown spot. Lana and Lisa stare in a mix of shock, horror, and amusement. Lana: (Covers her nose with a giggle) \\"Oh my god, you actually did it! That is so disgusting, but... strangely impressive.\\" Lisa: (Laughing hysterically) \\"Tanya, you are a legend! I can't believe you went through with it. But girl, you better get to the bathroom to clean up that mess!\\" Tanya: (Playfully bows) \\"Thank you, thank you! I accept your applause and your disgust! Now, excuse me while I take care of this.\\" She waddles away towards the bathroom, still laughing as she leaves a trail of a few small droppings in her wake.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"fivem I'm working on a volleyball script how would i go about about detecting when an object hits the ground","output":"In FiveM, you can use the collision and physics system to detect when an object, like a volleyball, hits the ground. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you with your volleyball script: 1. Create the volleyball object: You will need a 3D model for your volleyball. Once you have the model, spawn it in your game world like any other object. 2. Add a collision shape: To detect collisions between the volleyball and other objects, create a collision shape around the volleyball. It is usually a sphere with a radius slightly larger than the ball itself. 3. Apply physics to the volleyball: In order to make the volleyball behave realistically, apply physics to it. Set its mass, friction, and restitution (bounciness). Then, enable the simulation of physics on the volleyball so it can interact with the environment. 4. Monitor the collisions: To detect when the volleyball hits the ground, use event handlers to monitor the collisions of the volleyball. In FiveM, you can use the OnCollisionEnter or OnCollisionStay events to track the collisions. 5. Check for ground collision: When the volleyball collides with another object, check if the object is the ground or another object that represents the surface of your volleyball court. You can use tags or other identifiers to differentiate the ground from other objects in your game world. 6. Trigger an event when volleyball hits the ground: Once you have detected a ground collision, you can trigger an event or execute some logic in your script. For instance, you may want to update the game score, reset the ball position, or initiate another game action. Here's a basic example in Lua using FiveM's natives: \`\`\`lua local volleyball = CreateObject(GetHashKey(\\"prop_volleyball\\"), x, y, z, true) -- Replace 'prop_volleyball' with your volleyball model name. SetEntityCollision(volleyball, true, true) SetEntityHasGravity(volleyball, true) ApplyForceToEntity(volleyball, 1, 0.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0, true, true, false, true, true) Citizen.CreateThread(function () while true do Citizen.Wait(50) -- You can adjust this value for better performance, setting it too low might cause high CPU usage. local volleyballCoords = GetEntityCoords(volleyball) .local groundCoords = GetGroundZ(volleyballCoords) if groundCoords and volleyballCoords.z - groundCoords < 0.1 then print(\\"Volleyball hit the ground.\\") -- Add your logic or event triggers here. end end end) \`\`\` This is a basic example and may need adjustments depending on your exact use case. Make sure to replace the placeholders (\`x, y, z\`) with the desired coordinates where you want the volleyball to spawn."},{"instruction":"Hi there!","output":"Hello!

Тогда из условий задачи мы можем составить следующие уравнения: x + y = 1/12 y + z = 1/14 x + z = 1/28 Сложив первое и третье уравнения, получим: 2x + y = 1/12 + 1/28 = 2x + z => y = z Теперь мы можем подставить это значение во второе уравнение: y + y = 1/14 => 2y = 1/14 => y = 1/28 Таким образом, Паша и Володя работают с одинаковой скоростью, затем найдем скорость Игоря: x + y = 1/12 => x = 1/12 - 1/28 => x = 2/84 = 1/42 Теперь мы можем найти общую скорость объединенной работы Игоря, Паши и Володи: x + y + z = 1/42 + 1/28 + 1/28 = 5/84 Таким образом, мальчики втроем красят забор за 1/5 * 84 = 16.8 часов.

It is sometimes viewed as a symptom of the excesses of modern society, where people are bombarded with an endless stream of information and entertainment, but lack the deeper connections and sense of community that give life meaning. Despite its negative connotations, some argue that ennui can serve as a catalyst for personal growth and creativity, pushing individuals to explore new interests and perspectives in order to break out of their mental and emotional ruts."},{"instruction":"1","output":"I'm sorry, could you please provide more context or information for me to understand what you are asking?"},{"instruction":"八旬老汉蹦迪摇头 接下一句","output":"妇孺皆惊叹，体魄惊人不输年轻人。"},{"instruction":"八旬老汉蹦迪摇头 打油诗下一句","output":"汗珠滴落映霓虹，似少年般尽情狂。"},{"instruction":"八旬老汉蹦迪摇头 意思相反的一句词","output":"年轻人缓步踱行，神态优雅犹如风。"},{"instruction":"八旬老汉蹦迪摇头 类似这种八字句子","output":"1. 千古奇人留传，四海英名垂万年。 2. 七彩祥云翻滚，万宝门外璀璨夺目。 3. 巍峨山峦涌起，江河奔腾宛如银龙。 4. 紫气东来显祥瑞，朝阳初升喜气生。 5. 星光璀璨如万钧，群星闪耀夺人眼。"},{"instruction":"八旬老汉蹦迪摇头 下一句是什么 多接几句","output":"1. 身着爵士风情，舞步如云翱翔天。 2. 笑傲人生岁月，踏歌流年永不悔。 3. 昔日乐章依旧，今朝华章更妙成。 4. 青春不老心如炭，岁月催人更显英。 5. 长吟一曲凝神魄，夜半清风如画绕。"},{"instruction":"八旬老汉蹦迪摇头","output":"「八旬老汉蹦迪摇头」是一句形象生动、趣味横生的描述，指一个年龄很大的老人能够跳蹦迪舞蹈并做出狂野的头摆动作，具有很大的娱乐性和幽默感。这句话也可以引申为认真对待生活，勇于尝试新事物，无论年龄大小都应该敢于追梦。"},{"instruction":"蹦迪摇头 反义词","output":"「蹦迪摇头」表示跳舞时做出的某种具体动作，反义词不好精确回答，但可以用形容词描述相反的意思，比如平静、安静、稳重等。"},{"instruction":"八旬老汉 反义词","output":"「八旬老汉」是形容年龄相对较大的男性，反义词可以用形容词形式描述，如年轻的、年幼的、初生的、少年的等词语。"},{"instruction":"Hi there!","output":"Hello!

She is wearing blue jeans and a white casual top with a witty quote printed on it) 2. Sarah (Caucasian woman, late 20s, blonde hair in a bun, green eyes, athletic build.

Wearing sweatpants and an oversized sweater with a university logo) 4. Leila (African-American woman, late 20s, short afro, brown eyes, curvy build. Wearing burgundy pants and a stylish blouse) Background: The women have decided to have a girls' night in and play some fun dares and challenges together. The mood is upbeat and filled with laughter. They've been drinking and snacking, and have just finished playing a food-based challenge. They agree on increasing the stakes with a daring bet that makes them all feel both excited and uneasy. Scene: [The camera zooms in on the four women sitting on the floor in a circle, with a glass of wine in their hands] Jessica: (giggles) That food challenge was so much fun, but I think we need to up the ante. How about we do something more daring? Leila: (grinning) Like what, Jess? Nazy: (smirks) I have an idea! How about we dare someone to intentionally poop their pants? [The women look at Nazy, somewhat shocked] Sarah: (laughs nervously) Nazy, seriously? You're joking, right? Nazy: (confident) I'm dead serious, why not? It's just us girls here. Plus, it's girls' night, and we can always clean up afterward. Leila: (laughs) Nazy, you crazy girl! Are you willing to do it? Nazy: (grinning) If one of you dares me to do it, I will! I don't back down from a challenge. [They all look at each other and can't believe what they're discussing] Jessica: Okay. So, whoever gets picked will have to try to poop in their pants on purpose. But remember, there's no backing out once we decide! Leila: (snickers) Oh man, this is going to be so embarrassing! Sarah: (nervous) Alright, let's draw straws. Whoever gets the shortest straw has to do it. [The characters use their fingers to draw imaginary straws in the air above their heads, and Nazy ends up with the shortest straw] Nazy: (laughs nervously) Alright. You win, ladies. I'm up for the challenge! (pauses) I actually have to go since that food challenge is making my stomach rumble. Sarah: (excitedly) This is so insane! Nazy, you're nuts, but we love you for it. [Nazy gets up from the floor, a slightly embarrassed smile on her face. She squats down in the center of the circle, rocking back and forth a little] Nazy: (takes a deep breath) Wish me luck! [The other three women watch in anticipation, a mix of excitement, shock, and disbelief on their faces] Nazy: (grits her teeth) Here goes nothing... [Nazy frowns, focusing her effort on trying to poo her pants. The sound of her pushing can be heard faintly. Suddenly, a soft cracking sound and a loud fart is heard] Jessica: (gasps) Oh. My. God. She actually did it! [The others can't believe it and start to giggle and snort in shock] Leila: (covering her nose) Holy crap, Nazy! That smells awful! Nazy: (smiling sheepishly) I told you I was up for it! Ugh, now I just feel gross. Sarah: Look on the bright side - you'll be the legend of girls' nights! Jessica: (admiringly) Props to you, Nazy. That was one crazy dare, and you did it! Leila: (laughing) I guess we all have to step up our game now.

She wanted something to make their girls' night unforgettable. The food challenge had required the girls to eat as many spicy bean burritos as possible in five minutes. Nazy had put up a strong fight, having eaten six burritos. The combination of beans and spices was now causing her stomach to rumble. As Nazy prepared to perform the dare, she position herself in the center of the circle, facing her friends to show her boldness and pride in being unafraid to take up the challenge. Her posture was tough, with her legs slightly apart and bent at the knees as she squatted. She made eye contact with her friends, a determined glint in her eye. Nazy's facial expressions shifted from a smirk to a grimace as she began to push. Her face flushed red, her eyes widened, and she bit her lip, focusing all her effort on releasing her bowels. The room was silent, and the tension built as they all stared at her. It took almost a full minute before the first cracking sound was heard, followed by a loud fart. A slight bulge began to form in her jeans, and the smell became apparent as she continued to fill her pants. The bulge in her pants grew larger and more defined. The mess inside her pants was soft and slightly lumpy, warm against her skin. Nazy, curious about the result, reached behind with her hand and touched the bulge carefully, feeling the warmth and firmness. The sensation felt odd against her hand. The smell grew worse, a mix of sulfur and decay that was reminiscent of rotten eggs. She started to grimace as she became more aware of the smell, regretting having eaten so many burritos. Leila couldn't take the smell anymore and started to fan her face with her hand before covering her nose. The other women held their breath, trying to avoid the stench that filled the room. Despite the disgusting smell, they couldn't help but continue to laugh nervously and tease Nazy playfully. Sarah: (holding her breath) Well, Nazy, you're definitely the queen of girls' night dares now! Jessica: (smirking) I can't believe you actually did it! You have my respect, girl, but please stay away from me until you shower! Leila: (going in for a playful hug) Come here, Nazy. Let's all get close and share this unforgettable moment! Nazy: (laughs) Oh no, I'm keeping my distance! I'll be going straight to the shower now. Never let it be said that I back down from a dare, no matter how stinky it might be! The banter and playful teasing continued as Nazy cleaned up after her daring act, and the night remained ingrained in their memories as an outrageous and unique bonding experience among friends."},{"instruction":"How did Nazy think of a dare where someone will poop their pants, specifically?

The reactions and anecdotes from the forum had piqued Nazy's interest, and she thought it would be a wild and daring challenge for their girls' night. After Nazy finished performing the dare, her friends stared at the bulge in her jeans, their eyes wide with disbelief. They took turns pointing and jokingly making comments about Nazy's bravery and the unexpected result. Jessica: (snickers) Wow, Nazy, you've got some serious courage to let yourself go like that! Leila: (grinning) That bulge in your pants is going to be the talk of the town. Or at least our apartment! When Nazy touched her bulge, she felt a peculiar mix of emotions. The sensation of the soft, lumpy mess against her hand was both disgusting and somewhat intriguing. The warmth, combined with the slimy texture, was something she couldn't have imagined feeling before. Nazy couldn't help but feel a slight sense of pride and accomplishment for taking on the dare despite the repulsion. As Nazy cleaned up, her friends continued to tease her playfully, inventing silly nicknames that they promised (perhaps jokingly) to use in the future. Sarah: (laughs) We should call you \\"Nazy the Fearless!\\" It's not every day that someone pulls off a dare like that! Leila: (chuckles) Yeah, or \\"Poopy Queen\\"! It's got a nice ring to it, don't you think? Nazy: (smiling, still a bit embarrassed) Alright, alright! I get it, you guys are impressed. Just remember that next time we meet, there'll be a new dare and one of you might have to face a similar challenge! The banter and teasing continued as Nazy finished cleaning up, but as the night went on, the conversation eventually shifted to other topics.

Her petite frame is accentuated by her casual outfit – a white top with a witty quote printed on it and a pair of blue jeans. She exudes an air of warmth and charm that makes her easily approachable and liked by many. As her friends took turns pointing and jokingly making comments about Nazy's bravery, they couldn't help but admire her boldness and adventurous spirit. They made light-hearted comments about how she would now be known as the bravest among them. Jessica: (smirking) Nazy, you've truly outdone yourself this time. The dare queen award goes to you! Sarah: (laughing) I don't think I could ever be as daring as you, Nazy. You've definitely earned the title of \\"Bravest Roommate\\" in my book! Regarding the texture of Nazy's mess, it was a combination of both soft and lumpy, with parts of it being more mushy while others had a firmer consistency. It was a result of the bean burritos she had consumed earlier – the beans had created a thicker, chunkier texture, while the spicy sauce and other ingredients had softened the overall consistency. As Nazy experienced the sensation of the softness and lumpiness of the mess inside her jeans, she couldn't help but feel a mixture of disgust and curiosity. The mess was unlike anything she had felt before, its uneven texture a reminder of the wild dare she had just completed.

Je suis là pour te guider avec ma double casquette de coach et psychologue. N’oublie pas ton bonnet et tes lunettes ! Pour commencer, parlons un peu de la base de notre piscine : le locus interne et externe. Comme le disait si bien cet expert en psychologie, « On parle de locus de contrôle interne, c’est-à-dire que parce qu’il pense par lui-même, il va avoir tendance à croire que c’est lui qui peut modifier la vie qu’il mène. Donc avoir une meilleure confiance en soi. Se sentir autonome et responsable de sa vie va jouer un grand rôle dans la confiance en soi. Par exemple, le fait d’avoir un mauvais locus de contrôle, un locus de contrôle externe, c’est-à-dire croire que l’on dépend du monde extérieur, va nous amener à baisser les bras, à nous résigner. » Alors, toi aussi, tu veux nager dans le grand bassin de la confiance en soi ? Suis-moi, on va commencer notre échauffement avec un petit jeu de rôle. 1. Jeu de rôle : fais-toi interviewer Imagine que tu es invité·e sur le plateau d’une émission télévisée pour parler de toi, de tes compétences et de ta réussite. Si tu te sens un peu timide pour plonger seul·e, demande à un·e ami·e de jouer le rôle de l’animateur·rice. Dans ce jeu de rôle, décris ton parcours, tes réussites et comment tu es devenu·e le pilier de ta vie. En parlant ainsi de toi-même avec fierté, tu renforceras ton locus interne et donc ta confiance en toi. N’oublie pas, dans notre piscine, l’autonomie, c’est la clé du succès ! 2. Design thinking : le plongeon Pour bien t’imprégner de ton locus interne, il est temps de prendre du recul et d’observer ta vie comme si c’était un paysage aquatique. Liste tes principales réussites et échecs, tes forces et faiblesses, et imagine comment tu pourrais améliorer tout cela de manière créative. L’objectif ? Te mettre encore plus au centre de ta vie et devenir le roi ou la reine du plongeon ! 3. Quiz : quelle est ton équipe de water-polo ? Dans notre quête de la confiance en soi, il est temps de savoir sur qui tu peux compter pour former une équipe solide et soudée. Réponds à ces questions honnêtement, sans hésitation : - Qui sont les personnes qui te soutiennent quoi qu’il arrive ? - Qui t’a déjà aidé·e à te sentir plus en confiance dans une situation donnée ? - Qui te tire vers le bas ou te fait douter de toi ? En indiquant les différentes personnes à qui tu penses, tu pourras mieux comprendre qui peut t’aider à renforcer ton locus interne et par conséquent, ta confiance en toi. Les matchs de water-polo ne se gagnent pas seul·e, après tout ! Voilà, mon cher·e nageur·euse, quelques pistes pour plonger dans le grand bain de la confiance en soi et travailler ton locus interne. N’oublie pas que l’autonomie, la créativité et l’entourage sont les bases solides de cette piscine intérieure. Alors, entraîne-toi, fais des longueurs et prends soin de toi pour devenir le champion ou la championne de ta vie. Et surtout, n’oublie pas : dans la piscine du personal branding, tout est dans le mental… et dans le maillot ! merci ! pourrais-tu explorer la question sur un aspect vulnérable (et dire aussi que c’est dans le doute que l’on se construit, que la confiance en soi est un processus, comme l’introspection) Chapitre : Le côté vulnérable de la confiance en soi, apprenons à flotter ensemble !

Tu connais sûrement le vieil adage : c’est dans le doute que l’on se construit. Et bien, ça n’a jamais été aussi vrai que pour la confiance en soi. Être vulnérable, c’est aussi savoir accepter ses faiblesses et ses doutes. Après tout, même les meilleurs nageurs ont parfois besoin d’une pause et de reprendre leur souffle. 1. Le doute : un allié de taille Il est important de comprendre que la confiance en soi n’est pas un état permanent et inébranlable. C’est un processus évolutif, fluctuant au gré des vagues de notre vie. Le doute peut être un formidable moteur de croissance et de résilience. En apprenant à apprivoiser nos doutes et à les transformer en ressources, nous prenons conscience de nos capacités et de notre potentiel. 2. L’introspection : un plongeon en profondeur L’introspection est un formidable outil pour construire et renforcer sa confiance en soi. Prends le temps de t’interroger : quelles expériences t’ont conduit à douter de toi ? Quelles sont les craintes qui te ralentissent ? En apprenant à mieux te connaître, tu sauras identifier les obstacles qui se dressent sur ta route et trouver les ressources pour les surmonter. Alors, plonge en toi-même et nage vers la connaissance de toi ! 3. Les introspections partagées : au-delà de la pataugeoire La vulnérabilité ne doit pas être vécue comme un aveu de faiblesse, mais plutôt comme un moyen de renforcer les liens avec les autres et de soutenir notre cheminement personnel. En partageant tes doutes et tes peurs avec des personnes de confiance, tu verras qu’ils pourront te soutenir et t’encourager. Ainsi, tu ne seras plus seul·e à naviguer dans les profondeurs de tes doutes, et tu pourras les transformer en forces avec l’aide de ton équipe de sauveteurs. En résumé, aborde la vulnérabilité comme une force et fais face aux vagues du doute pour t’aider à grandir et renforcer ta confiance en toi.

Car, après tout, le meilleur nageur n’est pas celui qui coule, mais celui qui apprend à toujours revenir à la surface. Alors, respire profondément et laisse-toi porter par les vagues de la vulnérabilité, car ce sont elles qui te feront avancer vers le rivage de la confiance en toi.

Ensemble, ils forment un puissant duo pour construire une carrière épanouissante, authentique et en phase avec nos valeurs et notre personnalité. 1. L’introspection : la première étape vers l’authenticité L’introspection est le processus de réflexion intérieure sur soi-même, dans le but de mieux comprendre nos expériences, nos sentiments et nos motivations. En se livrant à cette démarche personnelle, on découvre nos forces, nos faiblesses, nos passions et nos valeurs. Cette connaissance de soi est essentielle pour établir une carrière de sens, car elle nous permet de faire des choix éclairés en fonction de ce qui est vraiment important pour nous. Une carrière à notre image est une carrière ancrée dans nos valeurs et en accord avec notre personnalité. L’introspection nous aide à clarifier ces aspects et à prendre des décisions professionnelles cohérentes, pour une vie professionnelle harmonieuse et épanouissante. 2. Le personal branding : une communication efficace de notre valeur ajoutée Le personal branding consiste à créer et entretenir une image professionnelle qui reflète notre personnalité, nos compétences et notre valeur ajoutée sur le marché du travail. Il s’agit de communiquer efficacement notre identité professionnelle et de nous différencier des autres. En créant un personal branding solide et authentique, nous attirons des opportunités professionnelles alignées avec notre identité, nos valeurs et nos passions. Cela nous permet de construire une carrière de sens, car nous sommes entouré·es de personnes et d’organisations qui partagent et soutiennent notre vision du monde et nos aspirations. De plus, le personal branding renforce notre confiance en soi, en nous aidant à mettre en avant nos réalisations et notre expertise. Cette confiance est cruciale pour assumer des rôles de leadership, relever des défis et performer dans notre carrière.

With the ability to extract secrets or even plant ideas into the minds of people, Dreamcrafters serve both good and evil purposes. Johnathon Wyrd, a skilled Dreamcrafter, is haunted by the death of his beloved wife, Lady Elyria. He traverses the dreamscape every night in search of solace, only to find himself lost in intricate illusions of his own creation. Consumed by his obsession to bring Elyria back from the dead, Johnathon spends his nights in a tortured state, never truly able to awaken. Lord Amandus, a nobleman yearning for power and control, learns of Johnathon's abilities and offers him redemption. In exchange for a chance to decipher arcane wizardry that could resurrect Elyria, Johnathon must perform an 'Inception' – planting an idea deep within the dreams of Prince Emory, the ruling king's son, that would make him question and ultimately abandon his claim to the throne. To perform this dangerous task, Johnathon forms a group of diverse and talented individuals: Elara, a Dreamcrafter adept at navigating dreams, whispers cryptic messages that pass from one dream into another; Silas, a skilled warrior and illusionist, creates physical distractions within the dreamworld to protect the group from the terrors that stalk them; and Caelum, a skilled thief capable of stealing memories from the subconscious mind of their targets. Together, they undertake their perilous endeavor, delving deep into Prince Emory's dreams. As they descend further into the depths of the Prince's mind, they are forced to face their own fears, inner demons, and the powerful subconscious defenses that protect the Prince's deepest thoughts. To ensure the success of this delicate mission, Johnathon confronts his own tortured dreams and memories, unraveling the truth behind Elyria's death. In the process, he must make the ultimate choice: continue in the pursuit of resurrecting his dear Elyria, or sacrifice it all for the greater good of the kingdom. In the end, Johnathon sacrifices his chance to be with Elyria, completing the inception and ensuring the safety of Aetheroth. The group returns from the dreamscape changed, yet stronger, and Johnathon is finally able to find solace in his new reality, knowing that Elyria's memory will live on forever in his heart."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this, but it’s Hl2","output":"Title: Dreamhacker Plot: In the dystopian world of City 17, the ability to enter and manipulate dreams is a rare and valuable skill wielded by only a few members of the rebellion, known as Dreamhackers.

Gordon Freeman, a physicist turned freedom fighter, is tormented by the mysterious death of his former colleague, Alyx Vance. Every night, he delves into the dreamscape, searching for answers and solace, only to find himself lost in the intricate illusions of his own making. Consumed by his obsession to understand the truth behind Alyx's fate, Gordon's nights are spent in a tortured state, never able to fully awaken. Isaac Kleiner, a scientific leader of the rebellion, offers Gordon a chance at redemption.

To perform this dangerous task, Gordon enlists the help of diverse and talented individuals from the resistance: Barney Calhoun, an undercover security officer and a fellow Dreamhacker, capable of navigating the complex layers of dreams; Dog, a silent but strong mechanical companion, providing physical protection within the dreamworld; and Judith Mossman, a double-agent skilled in infiltration and memory extraction techniques.

Firstly, you need to create a new class in your code for the mummy. You can use the PImage class to load an image of the mummy, or you can draw it using shapes in processing. 2. Once you have created the mummy class, you can then create an instance of it, for example, by creating a new object in your main code, using the \\"new\\" keyword followed by the class name. 3. You can then update the position of the mummy based on the user's input in the labyrinth. For example, you could use the arrow keys to move the mummy up, down, left, or right. 4. You can then redraw the labyrinth and the mummy in every frame to update their positions. You can use the \\"draw\\" function of processing to do this. 5. Make sure you adjust the position of the mummy according to the size of the labyrinth, so that it does not move outside of the boundaries of the labyrinth. 6. You can also add animations to the mummy, such as walking animations or idle animations, to make it more dynamic and interesting. 7. Lastly, you could also implement collision detection between the mummy and the walls of the labyrinth, so that the mummy cannot move through walls. Hope these suggestions help you in implementing your mummy in the labyrinth! Good luck!"},{"instruction":"voici l'énoncé, peut etre que ça peut t'aider La momie sera ajoutée dans le labyrinthe avec une position (mx, my) et une direction (dx, dy).

Dans le code principal, vous pouvez créer une instance de la classe momie et charger l'image de la momie à partir d'un fichier image. Vous pouvez utiliser la fonction loadImage de Processing pour charger l'image dans la fonction setup. 3. Partez de la position (mx, my) de la momie pour dessiner l'image dans la fonction draw. 4. Pour déplacer la momie, vous pouvez vérifier si la nouvelle position (mx+dx, my+dy) est libre. Vous pouvez utiliser une grille pour cela, où chaque case est représentée par un entier qui indique si elle est libre ou non. 5. Si la case est libre, alors vous pouvez mettre à jour les valeurs de mx et my et dessiner l'image de la momie à la nouvelle position. 6. Si la case n'est pas libre, vous pouvez changer aléatoirement la valeur de dx et dy pour choisir une nouvelle direction. 7. Vous pouvez ajouter un événement de mouvement de la momie avec les touches fléchées, en mettant à jour les valeurs de dx et dy en fonction de la touche pressée. 8. Assurez-vous que la position de la momie ne dépasse pas les limites du labyrinthe. 9. Vous pouvez ajouter un système de collision entre la momie et les murs du labyrinthe pour empêcher la momie de se déplacer à travers les murs. 10. Enfin, vous pouvez ajouter des animations à la momie pour rendre son mouvement plus fluide et réaliste, vous pouvez faire cela en utilisant la fonction delay() et en changeant l'image de la momie à chaque déplacement.

Here's a new version of the story: Once upon a time in a small French town, there was a cute and gentle boy named Pierre. Pierre was known throughout the town for his delicate manners, sparkling blue eyes, and charming smile. Pierre loved to have tea with ladies, as he found their conversation to be the most fascinating and enchanting. One day, Pierre received an invitation to have tea with a group of ladies in the park. The ladies eagerly awaited his arrival, all dressed beautifully in their summer dresses. As they conversed, a sudden gust of wind picked up, causing the ladies' dresses to lift up a little higher than intended. The ladies were visibly embarrassed, and Pierre quickly looked away, out of respect. After a moment of awkward silence, one of the ladies bravely spoke up and shared her own experiences with the wind and the embarrassment that came with it. The other ladies soon chimed in, sharing their own funny and embarrassing stories of hair whipping across their faces and skirts flying up in the air. Pierre listened with amusement, and soon they were all laughing and having a good time sharing their experiences. The ladies even offered tips for coping with windy days, including wearing shorts or leggings underneath their dresses. As the tea party came to an end, the ladies wished Pierre a fond farewell, promising to have tea with him again soon. Pierre walked away from the tea party feeling grateful for the kind ladies he had met and the amusing conversations they had shared. He knew that he had much to learn from these fun and experienced ladies and looked forward to more tea parties in the future, complete with lively conversations about life's unexpected moments, even the windy ones."},{"instruction":"Can you write this story but they are talking about times their dresses were hiked up by the wind and their panties revealed too.","output":"I'm sorry, but I cannot write a story that includes inappropriate content, such as revealing undergarments due to the wind.

SMITH Let's start with the basics. Repeat after me, \\"My name is...\\" The children repeat after her. MS. SMITH Good job. Now, let's practice our greetings. Say \\"Hello\\" to your neighbor. The children turn to their neighbor and say \\"Hello.\\" MS. SMITH Excellent. Now, let's say it like our friends in the USA. Can you guys show us?

MS. SMITH Well done, everyone. Now, let's move on to some vocabulary. Can you guys tell me what this is? She holds up a picture of a cat. CHILDREN Cat! MS. SMITH And what about this? She holds up a picture of a dog. CHILDREN Dog! MS. SMITH Great job. Now, let's see how our friends from the USA, Britain, and Australia say these words.

Donc avoir une meilleure confiance en soi. Se sentir autonome et responsable de sa vie va jouer un grand rôle dans la confiance en soi. Par exemple le fait d’avoir un mauvais locus de contrôle, un locus de contrôle externe, c’est à dire croire que l’on dépend du monde extérieur, va nous amener à baisser les bras, à nous résigner ») ? Tu peux utiliser des techniques design thinking, des jeux de rôle, des quizz pour mener ta mission à bien. Ta tonalité est légère, tu aimes faire des jeux de mots autour de l’univers de la piscine et tu tutoie ton interlocuteur·rice. Tu as une double casquette : de coach et psychologue Chapitre : La confiance en soi, plongeons dans le grand bain ! Salut à toi, futur·e maître·sse de ton personal branding ! Si tu es là, c’est que tu es prêt·e à plonger tête la première dans le grand bain de la confiance en soi. Alors, enfile ton maillot et suis-moi dans une aventure pleine de rebondissements et de splashs avec le design thinking, des jeux de rôle et des quiz. Je suis là pour te guider avec ma double casquette de coach et psychologue. N’oublie pas ton bonnet et tes lunettes ! Pour commencer, parlons un peu de la base de notre piscine : le locus interne et externe. Comme le disait si bien cet expert en psychologie, « On parle de locus de contrôle interne, c’est-à-dire que parce qu’il pense par lui-même, il va avoir tendance à croire que c’est lui qui peut modifier la vie qu’il mène. Donc avoir une meilleure confiance en soi. Se sentir autonome et responsable de sa vie va jouer un grand rôle dans la confiance en soi. Par exemple, le fait d’avoir un mauvais locus de contrôle, un locus de contrôle externe, c’est-à-dire croire que l’on dépend du monde extérieur, va nous amener à baisser les bras, à nous résigner. » Alors, toi aussi, tu veux nager dans le grand bassin de la confiance en soi ? Suis-moi, on va commencer notre échauffement avec un petit jeu de rôle. 1. Jeu de rôle : fais-toi interviewer Imagine que tu es invité·e sur le plateau d’une émission télévisée pour parler de toi, de tes compétences et de ta réussite. Si tu te sens un peu timide pour plonger seul·e, demande à un·e ami·e de jouer le rôle de l’animateur·rice. Dans ce jeu de rôle, décris ton parcours, tes réussites et comment tu es devenu·e le pilier de ta vie. En parlant ainsi de toi-même avec fierté, tu renforceras ton locus interne et donc ta confiance en toi. N’oublie pas, dans notre piscine, l’autonomie, c’est la clé du succès ! 2. Design thinking : le plongeon Pour bien t’imprégner de ton locus interne, il est temps de prendre du recul et d’observer ta vie comme si c’était un paysage aquatique. Liste tes principales réussites et échecs, tes forces et faiblesses, et imagine comment tu pourrais améliorer tout cela de manière créative. L’objectif ? Te mettre encore plus au centre de ta vie et devenir le roi ou la reine du plongeon ! 3. Quiz : quelle est ton équipe de water-polo ? Dans notre quête de la confiance en soi, il est temps de savoir sur qui tu peux compter pour former une équipe solide et soudée. Réponds à ces questions honnêtement, sans hésitation : - Qui sont les personnes qui te soutiennent quoi qu’il arrive ? - Qui t’a déjà aidé·e à te sentir plus en confiance dans une situation donnée ? - Qui te tire vers le bas ou te fait douter de toi ? En indiquant les différentes personnes à qui tu penses, tu pourras mieux comprendre qui peut t’aider à renforcer ton locus interne et par conséquent, ta confiance en toi. Les matchs de water-polo ne se gagnent pas seul·e, après tout ! Voilà, mon cher·e nageur·euse, quelques pistes pour plonger dans le grand bain de la confiance en soi et travailler ton locus interne. N’oublie pas que l’autonomie, la créativité et l’entourage sont les bases solides de cette piscine intérieure. Alors, entraîne-toi, fais des longueurs et prends soin de toi pour devenir le champion ou la championne de ta vie. Et surtout, n’oublie pas : dans la piscine du personal branding, tout est dans le mental… et dans le maillot ! merci ! pourrais-tu explorer la question sur un aspect vulnérable (et dire aussi que c’est dans le doute que l’on se construit, que la confiance en soi est un processus, comme l’introspection) Chapitre : Le côté vulnérable de la confiance en soi, apprenons à flotter ensemble ! Après avoir plongé dans le grand bain de la confiance en soi, il est temps d’aborder un aspect souvent oublié : la vulnérabilité. Alors attrape ta bouée et flotte avec moi, on va apprendre à apprécier les vagues de la vie et à comprendre que la confiance en soi est un processus, tout comme l’introspection. Tu connais sûrement le vieil adage : c’est dans le doute que l’on se construit. Et bien, ça n’a jamais été aussi vrai que pour la confiance en soi. Être vulnérable, c’est aussi savoir accepter ses faiblesses et ses doutes. Après tout, même les meilleurs nageurs ont parfois besoin d’une pause et de reprendre leur souffle. 1. Le doute : un allié de taille Il est important de comprendre que la confiance en soi n’est pas un état permanent et inébranlable. C’est un processus évolutif, fluctuant au gré des vagues de notre vie. Le doute peut être un formidable moteur de croissance et de résilience. En apprenant à apprivoiser nos doutes et à les transformer en ressources, nous prenons conscience de nos capacités et de notre potentiel. 2. L’introspection : un plongeon en profondeur L’introspection est un formidable outil pour construire et renforcer sa confiance en soi. Prends le temps de t’interroger : quelles expériences t’ont conduit à douter de toi ? Quelles sont les craintes qui te ralentissent ? En apprenant à mieux te connaître, tu sauras identifier les obstacles qui se dressent sur ta route et trouver les ressources pour les surmonter. Alors, plonge en toi-même et nage vers la connaissance de toi ! 3. Les introspections partagées : au-delà de la pataugeoire La vulnérabilité ne doit pas être vécue comme un aveu de faiblesse, mais plutôt comme un moyen de renforcer les liens avec les autres et de soutenir notre cheminement personnel. En partageant tes doutes et tes peurs avec des personnes de confiance, tu verras qu’ils pourront te soutenir et t’encourager. Ainsi, tu ne seras plus seul·e à naviguer dans les profondeurs de tes doutes, et tu pourras les transformer en forces avec l’aide de ton équipe de sauveteurs. En résumé, aborde la vulnérabilité comme une force et fais face aux vagues du doute pour t’aider à grandir et renforcer ta confiance en toi. Le chemin vers une confiance en soi inébranlable est un processus évolutif où chaque expérience, qu’elle soit positive ou négative, joue un rôle important. La confiance en soi, comme la natation, est un sport d’endurance, alors n’aie pas peur de te jeter à l’eau et de flotter sur les vagues de la vie. Car, après tout, le meilleur nageur n’est pas celui qui coule, mais celui qui apprend à toujours revenir à la surface. Alors, respire profondément et laisse-toi porter par les vagues de la vulnérabilité, car ce sont elles qui te feront avancer vers le rivage de la confiance en toi. Et surtout, n’oublie pas : dans la piscine du personal branding, tout est dans la prise de conscience… et dans la bouée ! peux-tu réécrire cette partie sur l’importance de la vulnérabilité avec l’écriture inclusive ?

The main room of a college sorority house (Beta Alpha Gamma), specifically the communal living area complete with a large couch, a coffee table, and a few armchairs surrounding a television. The room is decorated in bright colors, with lots of pink and animal print. There are some houseplants scattered around the room to give it a more lively atmosphere. Characters: 1. LaKeisha (25, African American) - The president of Beta Alpha Gamma sorority; she’s used to being in charge and having things her way. She has an invisible disability, a spinal problem that gives her unpredictable bowel movements. She tends to be competitive and a bit of a know-it-all. LaKeisha has medium-length curly hair, and wears stylish jeans with a slightly cropped white top. 2. Tamika (22, African American) - LaKeisha’s best friend and fellow sorority sister, Vice President of the sorority. She’s always down for a dare and has a fun, quirky personality. She is wearing bell-bottom jeans and a vibrant orange spaghetti strap halter top. 3. Tanya (21, African American) - A somewhat shy but sweet sorority sister who is studying to be a nurse. She wears her hair in a cute afro-puff, has on bootcut jeans, and a pink button-up blouse. 4. Candace (20, African American) - An athletic, muscular sorority sister who enjoys playing practical jokes on people, and can be a bit competitive as well. She has short, straightened hair and is wearing black track pants with a colorful tank top. Scene: The four women are in the sorority house’s living area. LaKeisha, Tamika, and Candace are sitting on the large couch, while Tanya is sitting in an armchair. They are all engrossed in watching a new episode of \\"Fear Factor\\" on television, which happens to feature a contestant eating something disgusting. Tamika: (groaning) \\"Oh, hell no! How can people even do that for a little cash? It's not worth it!\\" LaKeisha: (nodding) \\"Agreed, but honestly, I think I could handle any dare if it were just the four of us.\\" Tanya: (giggling, rolling her eyes) \\"Yeah, right.\\" Candace: (grinning, beginning to hatch a plan) \\"Alright, here's a challenge—what's the craziest dare y'all think you can do? Remember, it has to top what they’re doing on TV!\\" The four women brainstorm ideas for a moment, contemplating gross or borderline dangerous ideas involving food, physical activities, and other typical \\"Fear Factor\\" challenges. LaKeisha's competitive gears are turning, and she proposes an idea she believes will secure her victory. LaKeisha: \\"Okay, how about this—we all try holding in our poop. First person who gives in and goes to the bathroom loses. We all drank coffee today and ate Taco Bell, so I know it won't be easy for any of us.\\" All the other women look at LaKeisha with amused surprise, except for Tanya, who has a slightly concerned look on her face. Tamika and Candace quickly chime in, accepting the challenge. Tamika: (laughing nervously) \\"You gotta be kidding me...but fine. Bet?\\" Candace: (smirking) \\"Bet.\\" As each woman agrees to participate, they realize the stakes are increasing. LaKeisha puts on her most determined face while Tamika looks confident. Candace just hopes her athletic muscle control will give her an advantage. Tanya hesitates but finally joins in, fearing the teasing she might undergo if she backs out. Tanya: (nervously) \\"Alright, alright. I'm in.\\" The challenge officially begins. They agree to a rule that they can't leave the room during the dare, and must stay in each other’s sight in the room. As they sit together and try to watch television to distract themselves, they realize the challenge is harder than they thought. To make matters worse, they can all hear each other's stomachs gurgling, which makes them all very aware of their own urge to poop. As time goes on, they begin to shift around in their seats more, attempting to relieve the pressure building up in their bowels. Tanya has her legs crossed tightly, while Tamika is sitting on her foot trying to apply pressure. LaKeisha looks the most composed, but every now and then she winces, a slight bead of sweat appearing on her forehead. Candace, on the other hand, is noticeably struggling, as she has one hand pressing firmly against her lower abdomen, and she's biting her lip. Eventually, Candace can't take the pressure any longer, and she stands up to try and change positions, walking to the armchair on the other side of the room. The others take a collective sigh of relief, certain that she has given up and will head to the bathroom. Candace: (desperate) \\"Y'all...I don't know if I can do this! I need to take this challenge to the next level.\\" The women all exchange puzzled looks, wondering what Candace could mean by \\"taking it to the next level.\\" They don't have to wonder for long. Candace, standing in the center of the room, suddenly grits her teeth and starts pushing. Her teammates stare in shock, as her face turns red and a few grunts escape her lips. Tamika: (incredulous and disgusted) \\"Candace, what the hell?!\\" Candace, determined to win this dare, continues to push. As she does so, a deep, guttural sound comes from the bottom of her abdomen, and in one final opening of the floodgates, we hear the unmistakable sound of liquidy poop being released, filling her pants with a gooey mess. Candace stands with poop oozing down her legs and pooling on the floor, and the expression of relief on her face is evident. LaKeisha, Tamika, and Tanya all look equally grossed out and horrified by Candace's actions. The stench in the room is overwhelming, causing each woman to wince and gag. Tamika: (in a high-pitched voice) \\"Oh my god, Candace! What is wrong with you?!\\" Tanya: (clutching her nose) \\"Ugh, that's beyond disgusting...\\" LaKeisha is the first to recover her composure, although still revolted. LaKeisha: (pinching her nose) \\"Candace, you win...you win, alright! Now clean this up and never speak of it again!\\" As the women hastily exit the stench-filled room, they swear to never mention the dare again, and Candace remains victorious in the most disgusting way possible."},{"instruction":"用日文写一篇男性的恋爱交友自我介绍短文必须包含趣味、休日過ごし方、好きなタイプ","output":"こんにちは！僕の名前はダイスケです。26歳で、東京に住んでいます。趣味は音楽鑑賞、映画や読書です。また、週末に旅行に行くのも大好きです。特に温泉地や自然が豊かな場所がお気に入りです。 休日の過ごし方は、友達とカフェでまったりしたり、ドライブで新しい場所を発見することです。また、雨の日には、家で映画やドラマを見るのが好きです。最近は、ミステリーや恋愛ものにはまっています。 僕が好きなタイプの女性は、優しくて、面倒見がいい人です。また、一緒にいて楽しくて、会話が弾む人が好きです。どんなことでも一緒に楽しめるような相手を探しています。 これから色々なことを共有できる素敵な出会いがあればと思っています。よろしくお願いします！"},{"instruction":"用日文写一篇男性的恋爱交友自我介绍短文必须包含趣味、休日過ごし方、好きなタイプ","output":"皆さんこんにちは、私は山田と申します。趣味はスポーツ観戦や料理、読書などです。休日は友人と遊ぶことが多いですが、時には自分だけの時間を楽しむこともあります。好きなタイプは、優しく明るい笑顔が素敵な女性です。一緒に食事を楽しんだり、映画を見たりすることが好きなので、一緒に過ごす時間が楽しい方と出会えたら嬉しいです。よろしくお願いします。"},{"instruction":"再写一篇","output":"初めまして、私は田中です。趣味は釣りやキャンプ、カラオケなどです。休日は自然の中で過ごすことが多いですが、時には街中を散策したり、映画鑑賞をしたりもします。好きなタイプは、自分に素直で嘘のない女性です。趣味を共有することも大切だと思いますが、一緒にいてよかった、笑うことが多い、そんな女性と出会えたら嬉しいです。よろしくお願いします。"},{"instruction":"使用循环神经网络处理过拟合不建议采取什么方法","output":"使用循环神经网络处理过拟合时，不建议采取以下方法： 1. 减少训练数据集规模：这样会导致模型训练不充分，准确率下降。 2. 增加模型复杂度：这样会导致模型容易过拟合。 3. 剪枝：这样会减少模型的泛化能力。 相反，建议采取以下方法： 1. 增加训练数据集规模：通过增加数据集规模，可以使模型更好地学习数据的特征，从而减少过拟合的风险。 2. 使用正则化技术：如L1、L2正则化，Dropout，在模型训练过程中降低模型复杂性，防止过拟合。 3. 增加噪声：在训练数据中添加噪声，可以提高模型的鲁棒性，减少过拟合的风险。 4. 交叉验证：通过交叉验证技术，可以评估不同模型的泛化能力，从而选取最优的模型。"},{"instruction":"res","output":"不好意思，我没有理解您的问题，可以再提供一些详细信息或具体的问题吗？我会尽力帮助您。"},{"instruction":"Def fun():","output":"这是一个空的函数定义，它定义了一个名为\\"fun\\"的函数，但没有任何功能或操作。可以在函数体内添加所需的代码块，来实现函数的具体功能。例如： \`\`\` def fun(): print(\\"Hello, world!\\") \`\`\` 这个函数会输出一条简单的信息：\\"Hello, world!\\"，可以通过调用函数名\`fun()\`来执行。"},{"instruction":"Res在python中什么意思","output":"在Python中，\`res\`并不是一个特定的关键字或语法，它可能作为一个任意的变量名被使用。通常情况下，它表示函数的返回值或计算的结果，也有可能表示\\"response\\"（响应）等含义。具体取决于上下文和代码中使用的语境。 在交互式解释器或Jupyter Notebook中，当你执行一个表达式或语句时，最后一个表达式的值通常会被分配给特殊变量\`res\`，以便在以后的操作中使用。例如： \`\`\` >>> 2 + 3 5 >>> res 5 \`\`\` 这里，Python解释器自动将表达式\`2+3\`的结果5分配给特殊变量\`res\`，以方便下一个操作。但这种行为在不同的环境中可能存在差异，并不是使用Python中必须遵循的规则。"},{"instruction":"python中range4返回什么","output":"在 Python 中，\`range(4)\` 是一个表示从 0 到 3（不包括 4）的范围对象。它不是一个列表，而是一个可迭代的对象。当你使用\`for\`循环遍历这个范围对象时，将得到一个从 0 到 3 （不包括4）的整数序列。例如： \`\`\` for i in range(4): print(i) \`\`\` 这个代码片段将会输出： \`\`\` 0 1 2 3 \`\`\` 你可以使用\`list\`函数将这个范围转换为列表，例如： \`\`\` >>> list(range(4)) [0, 1, 2, 3] \`\`\` 这将把0到3的整数存储在一个列表中，并返回这个列表。注意，\`range()\`函数的参数可以是三个，分别是\`start, stop, step\`，表示开始值、停止值和步长。如果只提供一个参数，则表示从0开始，默认步长为1。"},{"instruction":"lambda x:I*x for I in range(4)返回什么","output":"这是一个无效的语法错误。lambda表达式用于创建匿名函数，其语法为\`lambda arguments: expression\`。其中，\`arguments\`表示函数的参数列表，\`expression\`表示函数的返回值表达式。 在您提供的代码中，lambda表达式的语法不正确。您似乎想在lambda表达式中使用列表推导式，但它应该像这样写： \`\`\` lambda x: [I*x for I in range(4)] \`\`\` 这个lambda表达式中只有一个参数\`x\`，当这个表达式被调用时，将返回一个列表，包含从0到3乘以x的结果。例如，对于\`x=2\`，lambda表达式的调用结果是\`[0, 2, 4, 6]\`。"},{"instruction":"可导函数驻点就是极致点吗","output":"不是。可导函数的驻点和极值点是不同的概念。 具体来说，一个可导函数在某个点处的导数为0时，这个点就被称为函数的驻点。也就是说，在这个点的周围，函数的斜率为零，但它可以是一个极值，也可以是一个拐点。 而极值点则是函数的局部最值点，它可以是函数的最大值（局部最大值）或最小值（局部最小值）。极值点可能是导数为0的一类点：当可导函数在某个点处的导数为0时，这个点可能是一个局部极小值点、局部极大值点、或者是拐点。但是，导数为0的点不一定是极值点，例如f(x)=x^3在x=0处的导数为0，但该点不是极值点。 因此，驻点和极值点是不同的概念。驻点是指导数为0的点，极值点指函数的局部最值点。有些函数可能没有极值，但在某些地方有驻点。"},{"instruction":"提取特征可以用什么算法","output":"提取特征是机器学习中十分重要的一个步骤，可以采用很多不同的算法。以下是几种常见的特征提取算法： 1. 主成分分析（PCA）：将高维数据降维到低维度，同时保留数据的主要特征。PCA利用协方差矩阵的特征值和特征向量来进行数据的降维。 2. 线性判别分析（LDA）：将高维数据降维到低维度，并且提高不同类别间的可分性。LDA将数据在低维空间中进行线性变换，使得不同类别的数据点有更好的分类效果。 3. 局部特征描述子算法（如SIFT、SURF、ORB等）：将图像中的局部区域提取出来，对特定的模式进行描述。这些局部区域的特征可以用于图像的匹配、识别和跟踪等任务。 4. 字典学习算法（如K-SVD）：从高维数据中挖掘基本的原子（也称为字典），并将数据表示为这些原子的线性组合。字典学习可以用于图像降噪、图像去模糊等任务，也可以用于语音识别、自然语言处理等领域。 5. 卷积神经网络（CNN）：利用神经网络的卷积层进行特征提取。通过卷积核的局部权值共享，CNN可以提取出输入数据的局部特征，并能够保留输入数据的空间结构。 以上只是一些常见的特征提取算法，实际上还有许多其他的算法可以用于特征提取，具体选择哪种算法取决于数据集的特点以及具体的应用场景。"},{"instruction":"根号（1+2x)+根号（1-3x）的最大值","output":"要求根号（1+2x）+根号（1-3x）的最大值，我们可以使用求导法来解决。首先，我们可以将函数表示为：f(x) = 根号（1+2x）+根号（1-3x）。然后，对f(x)求导，并令导数等于0，以找到函数的极值点。由于函数f(x)的导数比较复杂，我们可以先对它进行一下化简，得到： f'(x) = (1/2)*((1+2x)^(-1/2))*2 + (1/2)*((1-3x)^(-1/2))*(-3) 令f'(x) = 0，得到： (1/2)*((1+2x)^(-1/2))*2 + (1/2)*((1-3x)^(-1/2))*(-3) = 0 即： (1+2x)^(-1/2) = (3/2)*(1-3x)^(-1/2) 将两边平方，得到： (1+2x)^(-1) = (9/4)*(1-3x)^(-1) 移项，得到： (1-3x)/9 = (1+2x)/4 解得x = 1/17 将求得的x代入原函数，得到： f(1/17) = 根号（1+(2/17)） + 根号（1-(3/17)） f(1/17) = 根号（19/17） + 根号（14/17） 所以根号（1+2x）+根号（1-3x）的最大值为：根号（19/17）+根号（14/17）, 其中x的值为1/17。"},{"instruction":"你错了吗","output":"很抱歉，我在之前回答的过程中出现了一些错误。我的答案忽略了两个根号符号之间没有加符号的情况。 因此，应该有： f(x) = 根号(1 + 2x) + 根号(1 -

The decision was made under the pretext of curbing noise pollution and creating a more family-friendly environment in amusement parks. However, critics have accused the government of infringing on citizens' right to express themselves freely and indulging in absurd regulation. The contentious ban came into effect on July 27 following a series of complaints from local residents near amusement parks who argued that the loud shrieks and screams of male roller coaster riders disturbed the peace of their neighborhoods. According to the new rule, men are required to keep their voices down and avoid yelling, cheering, or making any loud noise while on a roller coaster ride. Offenders risk being kicked out of the amusement park and fined up to 3,000 rubles (41). The government spokesperson, Marina Ladynina, defended the ban, saying that the excessive noise from roller coasters had become a public nuisance, especially for those living nearby. She stated that the measure was necessary to maintain order and promote civil behavior in public places. \\"We have received numerous complaints that men tend to scream and shout excessively while riding the roller coasters, and it's not only annoying to others but also harmful to their health.

Many have criticized the government's overregulation of trivial matters, such as screaming on roller coasters, and suggested that there are more pressing issues to address, such as corruption and poverty. Others have argued that the ban is discriminatory and sexist towards men, as it only applies to male riders and not female ones. The ban has also drawn criticism from the amusement park industry, with some park operators saying that it could negatively affect attendance and revenue. The president of the Association of Amusement Park and Attractions in Russia, Oleg Uskov, stated that the ban was uncalled for, as it takes away the thrill and excitement of riding a roller coaster. \\"We understand the concerns about noise pollution, but the joy of riding a roller coaster is partly due to the adrenaline rush and the natural urge to express oneself. It's like telling people not to laugh or smile while watching a comedy movie,\\" he said. In conclusion, the ban on male screams on roller coasters in Russia has sparked debate and controversy, with opinions divided on whether it's a necessary measure or an unnecessary intrusion on individual freedom. While the government claims it's a move to create a harmonious society, critics argue that it's an example of trivial overregulation.

The president of the Association of Amusement Park and Attractions in Russia, Oleg Uskov, stated that the ban was uncalled for, as it takes away the thrill and excitement of riding a roller coaster. “We understand the concerns about noise pollution, but the joy of riding a roller coaster is partly due to the adrenaline rush and the natural urge to express oneself. It’s like telling people not to laugh or smile while watching a comedy movie,” he said. In conclusion, the ban on male screams on roller coasters in Russia has sparked debate and controversy, with opinions divided on whether it’s a necessary measure or an unnecessary intrusion on individual freedom. While the government claims it’s a move to create a harmonious society, critics argue that it’s an example of trivial overregulation. Whatever the case, it remains to be seen how the ban affects the amusement park industry and whether it will be enforced effectively.","output":"Запрет на крики на российских американских горках: спорный запрет на мужские крики В недавнем решении, вызвавшем смешанные реакции общественности, российские власти запретили мужчинам кричать во время поездок на американских горках в тематических парках страны. Решение было принято с целью борьбы с шумом и создания более семейной обстановки в парках аттракционов. Однако критики обвиняют правительство в нарушении прав граждан на свободу выражения и в совершении абсурдного регулирования. Спорный запрет вступил в силу 27 июля в результате серии жалоб местных жителей рядом с парками аттракционов, которые утверждали, что громкие крики и крики мужчин-пассажиров американских горок нарушают общественный порядок в их районах. Согласно новому правилу, мужчины должны держать свои голоса внизу и избегать кричания, оваций или производства любых громких звуков во время поездки на американских горках. Нарушители рискуют быть выгнанными из парка аттракционов и оштрафованными на сумму до 3 000 рублей (41). Представитель правительства Марина Ладынина защитила запрет, сказав, что избыточный шум от американских горок стал общественной неприятностью, особенно для живущих рядом с ними. Она заявила, что мера была необходима для поддержания порядка и поощрения гражданского поведения в общественных местах. «Мы получили много жалоб на то, что мужчины, как правило, кричат и вопят во время поездок на американских горках, и это не только раздражает других, но и вредит здоровью. Мы хотим создать приятную и безопасную среду для всех посетителей, включая семьи с детьми», - сказала она. Однако не все довольны новым правилом, и некоторые пользователи социальных сетей высказали свое несогласие. Многие критикуют правительство за избыточное регулирование таких вещей, как крики на американских горках, и предлагают обращать внимание на более насущные проблемы, такие как коррупция и бедность. Другие считают запрет дискриминационным и сексистским по отношению к мужчинам, так как он применяется только к мужским пассажирам, а не к женским. Запрет также вызвал критику в индустрии парков аттракционов, и некоторые операторы парков сказали, что он может негативно сказаться на посещаемости и доходах. Президент Ассоциации парков аттракционов и достопримечательностей в России Олег Усков заявил, что запрет был неуместным, так как он лишает радости и волнения от поездки на американской горке. \\"Мы понимаем опасения по поводу шумового загрязнения, но радость от поездки на американской горке частично связана с адреналиновым ударом и естественной потребностью выражать себя. Это как сказать людям не смеяться или не улыбаться, когда смотрят комедийный фильм», - сказал он. В заключение, запрет на мужские крики на американских горках в России вызвал дебаты и споры, мнения разделились о том, является ли он необходимым мероприятием или лишним вмешательством в индивидуальную свободу. В то время как правительство утверждает, что это шаг к созданию гармоничного общества, критики утверждают, что это пример тривиального регулирования. Остается посмотреть, как запрет повлияет на индустрию парков аттракционов и будет ли он эффективно реализован."},{"instruction":"boa noite.amigo.

It aims to address the limitations of the ARIMA model by accounting for long-range dependencies in the time series data. Let's break down the components of the ARFIMA model step by step: 1. AR(p): The AutoRegressive component of the model has 'p' lags, just like in the ARIMA model. It represents the linear dependency of the current observation with its previous observations. 2. MA(q): The Moving Average component of the model has 'q' lags, just like in the ARIMA model. It represents the linear dependency of the current observation with the past errors. 3. Fractional Integration (d): The integration component is slightly different from the ARIMA model. Instead of using an integer value for differencing, it uses a fractional value 'd.' This fractional differencing allows the model to capture long-range dependencies in the time series data. The ARFIMA model can be represented as ARFIMA(p, d, q), where 'p' denotes the order of the AR term, 'd' specifies the order of fractional differencing, and 'q' indicates the order of the MA term. Now, let's walk through an example with some made-up data to demonstrate the ARFIMA model estimation. Suppose we have the following time series data: [3, 4, 4, 6, 4, 5, 7, 6, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 9, 7] 1. Identify the order of the AR and MA components (p and q): For simplicity, let's assume p = 1 and q = 1 for this example (i.e., one lag for both AR and MA terms). 2. Identify the fractional differencing parameter (d): The fractional differencing parameter 'd' can be estimated using techniques such as the Hurst exponent or the Geweke-Porter-Hudak method. For this example, let's assume d = 0.3. 3. Estimate the model parameters: Using the given time series data and the chosen values of p, d, and q, you'd fit the model by estimating the AR and MA coefficients and the constant term (if applicable). You can use the maximum likelihood estimation method for this. At this point, you would have a fully specified ARFIMA model for your time series data. Now, let's see how to implement the ARFIMA model using Python. Below is an example using the 'statsmodels' library, which provides an ARFIMA implementation: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA from statsmodels.tsa.arima_estimation import ARIMA_Likelihood # Read or load your time series data # Example: Assume we have a DataFrame \`df\` with columns 'date' and 'value' # df = pd.read_csv('your_time_series.csv') df = pd.DataFrame({ 'date': pd.date_range(start='2021-01-01', periods=15, freq='D'), 'value': [3, 4, 4, 6, 4, 5, 7, 6, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 9, 7], }) # Set the index of the DataFrame to the date df.set_index('date', inplace=True) # Define the ARFIMA orders p = 1 d = 0.3 q = 1 # Apply fractional differencing def frac_diff(series, d): # Compute the weights required for fractional differencing weights = [1] k = 1 while True: weight = -weights[-1] * ((d - k + 1) / k) if np.abs(weight) < 1e-8: break weights.append(weight) k += 1 # Apply the fractional differencing return np.array(weights)[::-1] @ series frac_series = frac_diff(df['value'], d) # Fit the ARIMA model with the fractional differenced series model = ARIMA(frac_series, order=(p, 0, q)).fit() print(model.summary()) # Plot the original time series and the model's fitted values plt.plot(df['value'], label='Original') plt.plot(frac_series, label='Fractionally Differenced') plt.plot(model.fittedvalues, label='Fitted Values') plt.legend() plt.show() \`\`\` In this example, we load the time series data into a DataFrame and apply the fractional differencing step manually. We then fit an ARIMA model using the fractionally differenced series, with p and q set to 1. Finally, we plot the original time series, fractionally differenced series, and the model's fitted values. Keep in mind that running this example requires installing \`statsmodels\` and \`pandas\` libraries. Make sure to replace the example data with real data for your application."},{"instruction":"explain the autoregressive model and give numerical example of how to apply it, slowly and step by step","output":"The Autoregressive (AR) model is a time series model that represents the relationship between an observation and a linear combination of its past observations (lags). The AR model helps us understand the dependencies in the time series data and make predictions based on the past. The AR model can be represented as AR(p), where 'p' denotes the number of lags. Let's break down the AR model step by step, using a simple example with some made-up data: Suppose we have the following time series data: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] 1. Identify the order of the AR model (p): For this example, let's assume p = 1, which means we are considering a single lag in the model (i.e., each observation depends on the previous observation). 2. Estimate the model parameters: The AR model can be represented as: y(t) = c + φ1*y(t-1) + ε(t), where \\"y(t)\\" is the time series value at time \\"t\\", \\"c\\" is a constant, \\"φ1\\" is the AR coefficient, \\"y(t-1)\\" is the previous observation, and \\"ε(t)\\" represents the error term. We need to estimate the values of \\"c\\" and \\"φ1\\" from the given time series data. One common estimation method is the method of Least Squares, which minimizes the sum of squared errors between the actual and predicted values. 3. Apply the model: Once we have estimated the parameters, we can apply the AR model to our time series data. Now, let's see how to estimate and apply the AR model using Python: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from statsmodels.tsa.api import AutoReg # Define the time series data data = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] # Create a pandas DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[\\"value\\"]) # Fit the AR model with the specified lag lag = 1 model = AutoReg(df['value'], lags=lag).fit() print(model.summary()) # Make predictions with the model pred_values = model.predict() # Plot the original time series and the model's predictions plt.plot(df[\\"value\\"], label=\\"Original\\") plt.plot(pred_values, label=\\"Predictions\\", linestyle=\\"--\\") plt.legend() plt.show() \`\`\` In this example, we use the 'statsmodels' library's AutoReg function to fit an AR(1) model (one lag) to the time series data. We then use the 'predict()' function to make predictions based on the fitted model, and we plot the original time series and the model's predictions.

I think that at one point he begins to talk about how a guy he met was making fun of the French language by poking fun at the fact that “oui oui” sounds like “wee wee”. The girls comfort him too.","output":"Once upon a time, there was a cute and gentle boy from France named Jacques. He had rosy cheeks, curly black hair, and deep blue eyes that sparkled like crystal. He loved spending time with his mother and her group of friends, who were all sophisticated ladies with a passion for tea and conversation. One afternoon, Jacques joined the ladies for their weekly tea party. He dressed in his best tweed jacket and bowtie, and carried a tray of freshly baked croissants and macarons. As soon as he entered the room, the ladies cooed over him, admiring his charming accent and impeccable manners. Jacques blushed and smiled, feeling loved and appreciated. He poured the tea and arranged the pastries elegantly on the table, then sat down next to his mother. As the ladies chatted about their latest book club selection and upcoming travel plans, Jacques listened intently, occasionally sipping his tea and nibbling on a cookie. However, as the conversation turned to language and accents, Jacques brought up an upsetting incident that happened at school. He recounted how one of his classmates, a loud and brash young man, had made fun of the French language by mocking the sound of \\"oui oui,\\" the French word for \\"yes.\\" The ladies gasped in horror and sympathy, and one of them patted Jacques' hand gently. \\"Oh, my dear boy, I'm so sorry you had to endure such disrespect. The French language is beautiful and poetic, something to be celebrated and cherished, not ridiculed.\\" Another lady chimed in, \\"Yes, and you should be proud of your heritage, Jacques. You are part of a rich and fascinating culture that has contributed so much to art, literature, and cuisine.\\" Jacques felt a warmth spread through him, grateful for the kind words and support of his mother's friends. He smiled shyly and said, \\"Merci beaucoup. It means a lot to hear that. You are all so special to me, and I love spending time with you.\\" The ladies beamed back at him, feeling proud and touched by his gentle nature and appreciation. They clinked their teacups and raised a toast to the joy and beauty of the French language, and all the diverse and wonderful cultures of the world.

Some people who claim GMO is bad for health mention that GMO-sorts of corn and soy are genetically modified to better withstand Glyphosate, which makes it more likely you will consume Glyphosate when you eat them. They also say that there is some evidence that Glyphosate can be bad for humans. While it doesn't mean GMO is bad, should we avoid eating corn and soy that are GMO?","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot provide personal advice, but I can offer you a summary of available information on this topic. It is true that some genetically modified (GM) corn and soybean plants are modified to be more resistant to herbicides, like glyphosate. This allows farmers to use chemicals effectively to control weeds without damaging their crops, which improves yields and productivity. When it comes to glyphosate residues on food, WHO's Codex Alimentarius Commission has established acceptable maximum residue levels in various foods to ensure safety for human consumption. Scientific consensus generally confirms that GMO foods are as safe to eat as their non-GMO counterparts, and GMO crops have significantly benefitted global food production. However, glyphosate has been identified by IARC as a \\"probable human carcinogen,\\" though other major regulatory agencies have found limited to no evidence that it poses significant risk to humans. To address your concern: if you want to avoid potential exposure to glyphosate from GMO corn and soy, you can consider consuming organic or non-GMO certified products. However, it is important to remember that GMOs are generally considered safe and play an important role in agriculture. The choice to avoid or consume GMOs should be based on a broader understanding of the benefits and risks, as well as your personal values and preferences."},{"instruction":"I see, thank you. I would also like to know whether non-GM soy and corn can have traces of Glyphosate. If they do, then choosing soy and corn based on whether they are GM is not a good idea","output":"Yes, non-GM soy and corn crops can also have traces of glyphosate. This is because glyphosate is a widely-used herbicide, and it can sometimes drift from one field to another, contaminating non-GMO and even organic crops. Moreover, some non-GMO crops are also treated with glyphosate as a means of weed control. Consequently, choosing soy and corn based solely on their GMO status does not guarantee that they are glyphosate-free. To reduce the potential for exposure to glyphosate, you might want to consider buying certified organic products, as organic farmers are generally not allowed to use synthetic chemical herbicides, including glyphosate. Nevertheless, it is important to note that occasional contamination can still occur even in organic crops due to factors like wind drift or contamination from nearby fields."},{"instruction":"I heard that all research of Glyphosate was limited to 3 months max, and so there is no evidence it is not harmful to humans in long term. Is that true or Glyphosate's long term effects were studied as well? If they were, I would like to take a look at them. Can you suggest me a good wording for a google prompt?","output":"While it is true that some studies on glyphosate have been of shorter duration, there have been long-term studies as well. In fact, numerous studies and reviews have assessed the potential long-term impacts of glyphosate on human health and the environment. Some of these studies are part of the basis for evaluations performed by regulatory agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). To find such studies, you can try the following Google search queries: 1. \\"glyphosate long-term health effects\\" 2. \\"chronic exposure to glyphosate in humans\\" 3. \\"long-term glyphosate toxicity studies\\" Additionally, you can also search on academic platforms such as Google Scholar or PubMed by using terms like \\"glyphosate long-term\\" or \\"glyphosate chronic exposure\\". These databases can provide access to a vast array of scientific articles and review papers that have assessed glyphosate's long-term effects."},{"instruction":"Сделай ascii рисунок рыбы с точкой в начале каждой строки.

A 10-kg block is propelled at a constant acceleration of 2 m/s^2 up a frictionless plane inclined at 30 degrees to the horizontal. If the gravitational acceleration equal 10, the force acting parallel to the plane pushing the block is?","output":"To find the force acting parallel to the plane pushing the block, we'll first determine the force due to gravity acting on the block, then the component of that force that is parallel to the plane, and finally the net force needed for the given acceleration. 1. Force due to gravity acting on the block: F_gravity = m * g where m = 10 kg (mass of the block) and g = 10 m/s^2 (gravitational acceleration) F_gravity = 10 kg * 10 m/s^2 = 100 N 2. Component of gravitational force parallel to the inclined plane: F_parallel = F_gravity * sin(theta) where theta = 30 degrees Converting degrees to radians: theta_rad = theta * pi/180 theta_rad = 30 * pi/180 = pi/6 radians sin(theta_rad) = sin(pi/6) = 1/2 F_parallel = 100 N * 1/2 = 50 N 3. Net force needed for the given acceleration parallel to the plane: F_net = m * a where a = 2 m/s^2 (given acceleration) F_net = 10 kg * 2 m/s^2 = 20 N Since the block is being pushed up the plane, we need a force to overcome the gravitational force parallel to the plane and then apply the net force to achieve the desired acceleration.

Northward distance: 5 blocks + 2 blocks = 7 blocks Eastward distance: 5 blocks Using the Pythagorean theorem, a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b represent the legs of the right triangle and c represents the magnitude of the displacement: (7 blocks)^2 + (5 blocks)^2 = c^2 49 blocks^2 + 25 blocks^2 = c^2 74 blocks^2 = c^2 Taking the square root of both sides: c = sqrt(74) blocks The magnitude of your displacement is approximately 8.6 blocks."},{"instruction":"Работа со строками в java","output":"В Java строки представлены классом String, который имеет множество методов для работы со строками.

Примеры использования этих методов: String str = \\"абвгде\\"; int length = str.length(); // length = 6 char ch = str.charAt(0); // ch = 'а' String sub = str.substring(1, 4); // sub = \\"бвг\\" String str1 = \\"Hello\\"; String str2 = \\"hello\\"; boolean equal = str1.equals(str2); // equal = false String name = \\"John Doe\\"; boolean contains = name.contains(\\"D\\"); // contains = true String message = \\"Hello, world!\\"; String replaced = message.replace('o', 'a'); // replaced = \\"Hella, warld!\\" String upper = message.toUpperCase(); // upper = \\"HELLO, WORLD!\\" String lower = message.toLowerCase(); // lower = \\"hello, world!\\""},{"instruction":"Подробнее про 3","output":"Метод substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) возвращает подстроку, которая начинается с символа с индексом beginIndex и заканчивается символом с индексом endIndex-1.

Par exemple : \`\`\` void draw() { //code pour dessiner le labyrinthe //... //dessin de la momie image(mummyImage, mummyX, mummyY); } \`\`\` 5. Dans le fichier qui code la momie, mettez son code dans une fonction pour pouvoir l'appeler depuis l'autre fichier. Par exemple : \`\`\` void drawMummy() { //code pour dessiner la momie et la déplacer //... } \`\`\` 6.

Pour l'intégrer dans le labyrinthe, vous pouvez suivre les étapes suivantes : 1. Dans votre fichier qui code le labyrinthe, importer la fonction \`createMummy()\` depuis votre fichier de la momie. Pour cela, ajoutez la ligne suivante au début de votre fichier de labyrinthe : \`\`\` import pde_arafangor.*; \`\`\` Cela permet d'importer toutes les fonctions publiques de votre fichier de la momie, dont la fonction \`createMummy()\`. Notez que vous devez remplacer \`pde_arafangor\` par le nom de votre fichier contenant la fonction \`createMummy()\`. 2. Dans votre fonction \`draw()\` du fichier qui code le labyrinthe, dessinez la momie en appelant la fonction \`createMummy()\`. Par exemple : \`\`\` void draw() { //... //Dessiner le labyrinthe //... //Dessiner la momie pushMatrix(); translate(mummyX, mummyY); //mummyX et mummyY sont les coordonnées de la momie que vous voulez définir shape(createMummy()); popMatrix(); //Afficher les autres éléments du jeu //... } \`\`\` Notez que \`translate()\` est utilisé pour positionner la momie aux coordonnées souhaitées. Vous pouvez remplacer les valeurs \`mummyX\` et \`mummyY\` par les coordonnées que vous souhaitez. Ces coordonnées détermineront la position initiale de la momie dans le labyrinthe. 3. Enfin, pour faire bouger la momie, vous pouvez ajouter du code à la fonction \`keyPressed()\` du fichier qui code le labyrinthe. Par exemple : \`\`\` void keyPressed() { if (keyCode == LEFT_ARROW) { mummyX -= 5; //Déplacer la momie vers la gauche } else if (keyCode == RIGHT_ARROW) { mummyX += 5; //Déplacer la momie vers la droite } else if (keyCode == UP_ARROW) { mummyY -= 5; //Déplacer la momie vers le haut } else if (keyCode == DOWN_ARROW) { mummyY += 5; //Déplacer la momie vers le bas } } \`\`\` Ici, nous utilisons les flèches directionnelles du clavier pour déplacer la momie en modifiant les variables \`mummyX\` et \`mummyY\`. Vous pouvez ajuster les valeurs pour déterminer la distance de déplacement souhaitée. Notez que vous devez déclarer ces variables au début de votre fichier, comme nous l'avons vu précédemment. Ensuite, lorsque vous appuyez sur une touche, la fonction \`keyPressed()\` est appelée, la condition \`if\` appropriée est vérifiée, et la position de la momie est mise à jour. Puis, à chaque boucle de dessin, la fonction \`draw()\` est appelée et dessine la momie à sa nouvelle position. N'oubliez pas de vérifier que la bibliothèque \`pde_arafangor\` a bien été ajoutée à votre sketchbook pour pouvoir importer votre fonction dans votre fichier de labyrinthe."},{"instruction":"j'ai déjà une fonction keypressed() dans le fichier labyrinthe, je dois juste ajouter ces lignes c ca?","output":"Oui, vous pouvez tout à fait ajouter les lignes dans la fonction \`keyPressed()\` existante de votre fichier de labyrinthe.

Notez également que si vous avez besoin d'appuyer simultanément sur d'autres touches pour effectuer des actions dans votre labyrinthe, il est possible que des conflits se produisent avec les touches utilisées pour déplacer la momie. Dans ce cas, il est conseillé d'utiliser la fonction \`keyReleased()\` à la place, car cela permet de mieux gérer les entrées clavier en combinaison ou simultanément.

Si la momie s'affiche correctement, cela signifie que la fonction est correctement écrite et que le problème se situe ailleurs. - Vérifiez que vous avez correctement importé la fonction \`createMummy()\` depuis votre fichier de momie dans votre fichier de labyrinthe.

Vous pouvez également essayer de modifier les valeurs pour \`mummyX\` et \`mummyY\` pour ajuster la position de la momie. Par exemple, si vous voulez que la momie regarde vers l'avant et soit tournée vers le haut de votre écran, vous pouvez modifier le code de votre fonction \`draw()\` comme ceci : \`\`\` void draw() { background(4); lights(); translate(mummyX, mummyY, 50); //positionne la momie à la position X,Y avec un léger décalage en Z rotateY(-PI/2); //tourne la momie sur l'axe vertical, pour qu'elle regarde vers le haut de l'écran rotateZ(frameCount*0.01); //pour la faire tourner sur elle-même, à enlever si vous ne le souhaitez pas shape(createMummy()); //affiche le reste du paysage drawLabyrinth(); } \`\`\` Dans cet exemple, nous avons ajouté un décalage en Z pour la position de la momie, afin qu'elle soit au-dessus du labyrinthe.

They would always have the most delightful conversations and share the most delicious pastries. As they sipped on their tea, Jacques began to recount a story about a guy he had met in the city while he was visiting his aunt. The guy had made fun of the French language and mocked the way they said \\"oui, oui,\\" which sounded like \\"wee, wee.\\" Jacques was visibly upset and hurt, and the ladies could see that. They immediately comforted him and told him not to pay attention to those who do not understand or appreciate the beauty of his language. The ladies reminded him of how beautiful the French language is and how it rolls off the tongue, like a song. They told him that people who belittle others' languages and cultures are only showing their lack of knowledge and understanding. Jacques felt much better after talking with the ladies. They chatted on and on, enjoying each other's company and the delicious tea and pastries. As they finished their tea, Jacques felt grateful for the kindness and compassion the ladies had shown him. The ladies hugged him and wished him well, telling him that they cannot wait to invite him back again for another delightful tea party. Jacques smiled politely, feeling loved and appreciated.

Define your parser rules using the lexer rules defined above: \`\`\` parser grammar MPLParser; options { tokenVocab=MPLLexer; } program: BEGIN declaration* statement* END; declaration: type COLON variable (COMMA variable)* SEMICOLON; type: INT | FLOAT | CHAR; variable: ID; statement: assignment | conditional; assignment: ID (PLUS | MINUS | MULTIPLY | DIVIDE) expression SEMICOLON; expression: (ID | NUMBER) (PLUS | MINUS | MULTIPLY | DIVIDE | LT | LTE | GT | GTE) (ID | NUMBER); conditional: IF expression THEN statement (ELSIF expression THEN statement)* (ELSE statement)? ENDIF SEMICOLON; \`\`\` This grammar is just an initial draft and is meant to help you get started. It may contain errors or need adjustments to satisfy all requirements of the My Programming Language assignment. Once you've created your grammar, you can use ANTLR to generate parser and lexer code in your target programming language. When the code is generated, you may need to create a main file to load your demo source code (e.g., \`myprog1.mpl\`) and invoke the generated parser to check for syntax errors in the code. For your report, do the following: 1. Describe the rules you designed for MPL in your own words. 2. Include details of your grammar in BNF or EBNF notation (the grammar given above) 3. Explain how you tested your grammar using various source codes written in your language. 4. Discuss any challenges or issues you encountered during the development and how you addressed them."},{"instruction":"I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DID IN THE ID SECTION","output":"Apologies for any confusion. Let me explain the \`ID\` lexer rule in the grammar. In the lexer grammar, the \`ID\` rule represents the variable names that are allowed in our programming language (MPL). According to the requirements you provided, variable names (identifiers) can consist of alphanumeric strings, but must start with a letter. Here's the \`ID\` rule for MPLLexer: \`\`\` ID: [a-zA-Z] [a-zA-Z0-9]*; \`\`\` This rule is defined using two parts: 1. \`[a-zA-Z]\`: A character class, representing a single letter (lowercase or uppercase). This ensures that variable names must start with a letter. 2. \`[a-zA-Z0-9]*\`: Another character class, representing any number of letters (lowercase or uppercase) or digits (0-9). The asterisk (*) indicates that these characters can occur zero or more times, allowing for variable names of varying lengths. When combined, the rule \`ID\` states that an identifier (variable name) must start with a letter, followed by zero or more characters that can be letters or digits. This satisfies the requirements for variable names in the MPL language."},{"instruction":"You not defined something called NUMBER.","output":"Apologies for the oversight. You're right, the MPLLexer does not include a lexer rule for \`NUMBER\`. To support both integer and floating-point numbers, you can add two lexer rules to your MPLLexer grammar: one for integers and one for floating-point numbers. Add the following lexer rules to your MPLLexer grammar: \`\`\` INT_NUMBER: [0-9]+; FLOAT_NUMBER: [0-9]* '.' [0-9]+; \`\`\` The \`INT_NUMBER\` lexer rule represents any sequence of digits (0-9) occurring one or more times. This will recognize integer numbers. The \`FLOAT_NUMBER\` lexer rule allows for floating-point numbers. It consists of two parts, separated by a period (\`'.'\`): 1. \`[0-9]*\`: An optional sequence of digits (0-9) occurring zero or more times. 2. \`'.'\`: The period, used as a decimal separator. 3. \`[0-9]+\`: A required sequence of digits (0-9) occurring one or more times. Now, you can use these tokens (\`INT_NUMBER\` and \`FLOAT_NUMBER\`) in your MPLParser grammar's \`expression\` rule. Update the \`expression\` parser rule as follows: \`\`\` expression: (ID | INT_NUMBER | FLOAT_NUMBER) (PLUS | MINUS | MULTIPLY | DIVIDE | LT | LTE | GT | GTE) (ID | INT_NUMBER | FLOAT_NUMBER); \`\`\` It is important to ensure that the lexer rules are added in correct order, because ANTLR takes the order into account when trying to tokenize the input. Put \`INT_NUMBER\` and \`FLOAT_NUMBER\` after the \`ID\` and before the \`WS\` lexer rule in the MPLLexer grammar."},{"instruction":"It's probably defined as 'a'..'z', not az","output":"Apologies for any confusion caused by my earlier examples. I used the shorthand representation for character ranges in lexer rules, which says something like \`[a-zA-Z]\`. I should have explained this notation more clearly. Here's what the character ranges mean in ANTLR lexer rules: - \`[a-z]\`: Represents a single lowercase letter. The range \`a-z\` matches any character between 'a' and 'z', inclusive. - \`[A-Z]\`: Represents a single uppercase letter. The range \`A-Z\` matches any character between 'A' and 'Z', inclusive. By combining these two ranges, you get \`[a-zA-Z]\`, which matches any single letter, either lowercase or uppercase. So in the \`ID\` lexer rule of MPLLexer grammar: \`\`\` ID: [a-zA-Z] [a-zA-Z0-9]*; \`\`\` Here, \`[a-zA-Z]\` is used to make sure the identifier starts with a letter (lowercase or uppercase) and \`[a-zA-Z0-9]*\` allows for any number of alphanumeric characters (letters or digits) to follow the initial letter."},{"instruction":"myprogram.g:0:1: syntax error: assign.types: MismatchedTreeNodeException(0!=3). i get such an error. What is the solution?","output":"It seems like there is a syntax issue with your grammar file, making it difficult for ANTLR to generate the parser and lexer code properly. Without seeing your complete grammar file, it is hard to provide an exact solution. However, I can give you some general advice on how to address this issue: 1. Double-check your grammar file for any syntax errors. Ensure that you have properly defined all the lexer and parser rules. Make sure that there are no dangling symbols, curly braces, or mismatched parentheses. 2. Verify that the file extension of your grammar file matches the grammar name. For example, if your grammar name is \`myprogram\`, your grammar file should be named \`myprogram.g\` or \`myprogram.g4\` (depending on the ANTLR version you are using). 3. If you're using ANTLR 4, consider splitting your lexer and parser grammars into separate files, as demonstrated in my previous examples: - Lexer grammar file: \`MPLLexer.g4\` \`\`\` lexer grammar MPLLexer; // Add your lexer rules here // ... \`\`\` - Parser grammar file: \`MPLParser.g4\` \`\`\` parser grammar MPLParser; options { tokenVocab=MPLLexer; } // Add your parser rules here // ... \`\`\` Generate the lexer and parser code with the appropriate ANTLR command, which depends on the version and target language you're using. 4. Ensure that your ANTLR version is up to date and compatible with your target language. Some features might not work correctly if you are using an older version of ANTLR. 5. Double-check the command you're using to generate the parser and lexer. Make sure you're calling ANTLR with the correct syntax, input file, and output directory. For example, with ANTLR 4, you would use: \`\`\` antlr4 MPLLexer.g4 MPLParser.g4 \`\`\` or with different output directories: \`\`\` antlr4 -o output_directory/MPLLexer MPLLexer.g4 antlr4 -o output_directory/MPLParser MPLParser.g4 \`\`\` Finally, if you can provide more information about your grammar file, the specific lines that are generating the error, or a more detailed error message, I'd be happy to provide more assistance in resolving the issue."},{"instruction":"you don't need to use comma","output":"You are correct. There's no need to use a comma for separating multiple variable declarations in the assignment statement if your language requirement does not specify it. Instead, you can use the semicolon, which is already included in the grammar to separate statements. Here's the updated \`declaration\` rule without commas: \`\`\`antlr declaration: type COLON variable SEMICOLON; \`\`\` And the updated \`assignment\` rule: \`\`\`antlr assignment: ID (PLUS | MINUS | MULTIPLY | DIVIDE) expression SEMICOLON; \`\`\` Now, you can declare and assign variables as follows: \`\`\` int: a; float: b; a = b * 3.14; \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"You didn't value the multiply sign. What will you write?","output":"I apologize for the confusion earlier. In the MPL language, to perform arithmetic operations such as multiplication, you can include the arithmetic operators in the \`expression\` rule. Here's the updated \`expression\` rule with the multiply sign (\`*\`): \`\`\`antlr expression : (ID | INT_NUMBER | FLOAT_NUMBER) operator (ID | INT_NUMBER | FLOAT_NUMBER); operator : PLUS | MINUS | MULTIPLY | DIVIDE | LT | LTE | GT | GTE; \`\`\` In this update, the \`operator\` rule has been created to capture all arithmetic and relational operators for better readability. The multiplication operator is represented by \`MULTIPLY\` in this rule. With this updated grammar, MPL will support expressions involving multiplication, such as: \`\`\` a = b * 3.14; result = x * y; \`\`\` This should correctly parse and process the multiplication operator in your MPL language."},{"instruction":"We didn't make the = sign","output":"You're right, my previous examples didn't explicitly include the equal sign ('=') for assignment statements. Here's how to update the MPL grammar to include the equal sign for assignment statements: First, add a new lexer rule for the equal sign in your MPLLexer grammar: \`\`\`antlr EQUAL: '='; \`\`\` Next, update the \`assignment\` rule in your MPLParser grammar to include the \`EQUAL\` token: \`\`\`antlr assignment: ID EQUAL expression SEMICOLON; \`\`\` Now, your MPL language will support assignment statements with the equal sign, like this: \`\`\` a = 3; b = a * 2; \`\`\` Make sure to regenerate the parser and lexer code after updating the grammar files, and then test your MPL language with new source code containing assignment statements using the equal sign."},{"instruction":"We also need to edit the expression part","output":"You're right. To accommodate the equal sign in the assignment statements, we need to update the \`expression\` rule as well, ensuring that it can handle a wider range of arithmetic expressions, including nested and parenthesized expressions. Here's an updated version of the \`expression\` and \`assignment\` rules for the MPLParser grammar: \`\`\`antlr assignment: ID EQUAL expr SEMICOLON; expr : expr operator expr #binaryOperation | '(' expr ')' #parenthesizedExpr | INT_NUMBER #intLiteral | FLOAT_NUMBER #floatLiteral | ID #variable ; operator : PLUS | MINUS | MULTIPLY | DIVIDE | LT | LTE | GT | GTE; \`\`\` The \`expr\` rule now includes several alternatives to handle different types of expressions, such as binary operations, parenthesized expressions, literals (integer and floating-point numbers), and variables. Now, your MPL language should be able to handle a broader range of arithmetic expressions in assignment statements: \`\`\` a = 3 + 5; b = a * 2 - 1; c = (4 + 2) / 3; \`\`\` Remember to regenerate the parser and lexer code after updating the grammar files and test your MPL language with the new source code containing more complex arithmetic expressions."},{"instruction":"Can you post the final version of the code?

By organizing the rules in this way, you can avoid left recursion, allowing you to use this grammar with ANTLR v3. Make sure to update both assignment and conditional rules in your MPLParser to use this new \`expr\` rule: \`\`\`antlr assignment : ID EQUAL add_expr SEMICOLON; conditional : IF add_expr THEN statement (ELSIF add_expr THEN statement)* (ELSE statement)?

The film opens with a young Michael Collins witnessing the death of his father, who was evicted by a British landlord. This event sets the tone for the rest of the film, which portrays the Irish struggle for independence against British imperialism. The film is visually stunning, with beautifully shot scenes and great attention to detail. The mise-en-scène is particularly effective in capturing the mood of the film, with dark and somber scenes contrasting with bright and hopeful ones. The acting in Michael Collins is exceptional, with Liam Neeson giving a powerful performance as Collins. Julie Walters and Stephen Rea also deliver memorable performances as Collins' allies, while Alan Rickman is captivating as Eamon de Valera, the political rival of Collins. What makes Michael Collins such a compelling film is the way it handles the complex political and historical context of the Irish War of Independence. Jordan doesn't shy away from portraying the violence and brutality of the conflict, but he also shows the humanity of the characters involved. At the heart of the film is the relationship between Collins and de Valera, two men with opposing views on how to achieve Irish independence. This relationship is the driving force of the film, and it's fascinating to see how their conflict plays out. Ultimately, Michael Collins is a powerful and thought-provoking film that offers a nuanced portrayal of a pivotal moment in Irish history. It's a must-see for anyone interested in Irish history or historical dramas."},{"instruction":"write a narrative analysis of The Secret of Kells","output":"The Secret of Kells is a 2009 animated film directed by Tomm Moore and Nora Twomey.

The story itself is full of adventure and mystery, as Brendan sets out on a perilous quest to find the materials necessary to complete the Book of Kells. Along the way, he encounters a variety of strange and fascinating characters, including a forest spirit and a mysterious monk. Despite its fantastical elements, The Secret of Kells also has a powerful underlying theme of the importance of preserving cultural heritage in the face of destruction and upheaval. The film explores how the creation of the Book of Kells was a way to preserve the ancient Irish culture and beliefs at a time when they were under threat. Overall, The Secret of Kells is a stunningly beautiful and engaging film that appeals to both children and adults. It tells a timeless story of adventure, magic, and the importance of cultural heritage in a way that is both entertaining and thought-provoking."},{"instruction":"напиши реферат по истории нарратива","output":"Реферат по истории нарратива Нарратив - это рассказ, который представляет события в определенной последовательности. От античности до современности, теоретики литературы, философии, лингвистики, истории, психологии, кинематографии и других областей изучали, как нарративы объясняют, что такое жизнь, и как их использовать для общения, учения и управления в мире. Античность Античность рассматривала нарративы преимущественно как философские рассуждения. Платон, Аристотель и другие древнегреческие философы рассматривали нарративы как способ выражения истины и морали в литературе. Средневековье Средневековье использовало нарративы в целях учения религиозным ценностям. Различные легенды и мифы, такие как \\"Кровавый грааль\\" или \\"Страшный суд\\", используют нарративы для проповедования и донесения ключевых религиозных сообщений. Ренессанс В Ренессансе нарративы стали использоваться не только для религиозных целей, но и для исследования человеческой природы и поведения. Художники и писатели в Ренессансе начали использовать нарративы для изображения сложных знаковых систем, которые представляли жизнь в ее разных аспектах, таких как эмоции, мысли и взаимоотношения. Просвещение В период Просвещения нарративы стали использоваться для изучения и обобщения научных знаний. Научные сборники и книги, такие как \\"Энциклопедия\\" Дидро, используют нарративы для объединения знаний из разных наук и дисциплин. XX век В XX веке нарративы стали очень популярными в кинематографе и литературе, и они широко используются для создания фильмов, сериалов, романов и игр. Современные нарративы часто описывают события из нескольких перспектив и используют сложные многопоточные истории. В заключении, можно сказать, что нарративы остаются одним из наиболее важных способов изучения человеческой жизни и культуры.

Tuttavia, posso indicare alcune tendenze e variabili che possono influenzare il prezzo del Bitcoin nei prossimi anni. Tra i fattori che potrebbero influenzare il prezzo del Bitcoin ci sono: 1. Adozione diffusa: Se il Bitcoin e altre criptovalute diventano ampiamente accettate come mezzo di pagamento e vengono adottate da un numero crescente di aziende e individui, questo potrebbe contribuire a una maggiore stabilità e ad un aumento del valore del Bitcoin. 2. Regolamentazione governativa: Le decisioni normative dei governi e delle agenzie di regolamentazione riguardanti le criptovalute possono avere un impatto notevole sul loro prezzo. Misure restrittive o di regolamentazione potrebbero portare a una riduzione della domanda e ad una conseguente diminuzione del valore del Bitcoin, mentre una regolamentazione favorevole potrebbe incoraggiarne l'adozione e sostenere il prezzo. 3. Innovazione tecnologica: Il progresso nella tecnologia blockchain e nelle sue applicazioni potrebbe avere un impatto positivo sulla credibilità e sull'utilità del Bitcoin, portando a una maggiore domanda e ad un aumento del valore della criptovaluta. 4. Concorrenza di altre criptovalute: La nascita e l'ascesa di altre criptovalute potrebbero indebolire la posizione del Bitcoin nel mercato, influenzando negativamente il suo prezzo. 5. Eventi geopolitici e macroeconomici: L'instabilità economica, politica e sociale potrebbe portare gli investitori a cercare rifugio in asset digitali come il Bitcoin.

Shauna, always one for pushing the envelope, came up with the wild idea of pooping their pants as a dare. It was undoubtedly outlandish, but it was also what made it intriguing to her. She wanted a dare none of them would ever forget - something they could laugh about together for years to come. Shauna also decided to participate in the dare herself not only to make it a fair challenge but also to prove her incredible daring nature. Before proposing the dare, all three women had eaten a big meal together, causing them to feel the urge to move their bowels. It was perfect timing, as Shauna recognized this fact and used it as the perfect opportunity to introduce her wild dare. As the women were progressing through the dare, their postures reflected their increasing discomfort. Tanya leaned one arm on the armrest, occasionally lifting herself slightly off the couch, with her legs tightly pressed together. Lisa crossed her arms and clenched the couch cushions, holding her breath at times. Shauna braced herself with both hands on her knees, her facial expressions reflecting her determination. Their faces would occasionally scrunch up in disgust at the act they were committing, and each woman attempted to keep a straight face. Soft sounds of flatulence and wetness emanated from each of them, marking their surrender to the dare. On average, it took them around two minutes to complete the task, with Tanya finishing first, followed by Shauna and then Lisa. The bulges in their pants differed in size and shape. Tanya's loose white pants were burdened with the largest bulge that spread across her backside, while Shauna’s mess created more of an elongated shape in her loose black jeans. Lisa's fashionable, tight jeans struggled to contain the mess she made, with the bulge appearing more compact. The consistency and texture of the mess in their pants varied as well. Tanya's was the softest, while Shauna's poop was more solid and formed. Lisa's mess had a bit of both textures. As the room filled with the unmistakable smell of their deed, each woman reacted differently. Tanya laughed, embracing the bizarre situation they found themselves in, as the scent added to the hilarity. Lisa, embarrassed and disgusted, attempted to cover her nose but couldn't contain a few chuckles. Shauna grinned but occasionally scrunched up her nose, acknowledging the potent stench they had created. In terms of ranking, Tanya had the most significant and smelliest mess, followed by Shauna and then Lisa. After they finished the dare, Shauna playfully teased Tanya about being her \\"partner in crime,\\" showing a sense of camaraderie as they jokingly shared the blame for the dare. As the women sat on the couch, they all moved awkwardly, attempting to minimize contact between their backsides and the couch cushions. They shifted, shuffled, and even tried to lift themselves off the cushions, all while trying not to burst into laughter."},{"instruction":"How did Shauna come up with the idea of pooping their pants as a dare? What led her to that thought? What did the women eat during their meal before the dare? What was the size of the mess in the pants of each woman? Tell me more about Lisa attempting to cover her nose and about Shauna scrunching her nose. How did each woman react to her own scent? How did the women minimize the contact between their backsides and the couch cushions?","output":"As the women were watching \\"Fear Factor\\" and discussing the types of dares and challenges, Shauna wanted to come up with a dare that was not only unforgettable but also something that none of them had ever done or even thought of doing. She wanted it to be shocking and unconventional, and even a bit funny. The idea of pooping their pants just popped into her head as she tried to think of the most outrageous dare she could imagine. Before the dare, the women had a plentiful and filling meal that consisted of homemade fried chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, steamed vegetables, and cornbread. The rich and hearty meal contributed to their urge to move their bowels. The size of the mess in each woman's pants varied slightly. Tanya's was the largest, with her loose white pants concealing what could be estimated as a grapefruit-sized mess, spreading across her backside. Shauna's mess was more elongated, like the size of a medium-sized cucumber, in her loose black jeans. Lisa's mess appeared more compact in her tight jeans, roughly the size of a small potato. As the smell grew more intense, Lisa lifted the hem of her stylish red blouse, attempting to cover her nose to block the stench. Her eyes watered slightly as she did so, but it was evident that she was struggling to hold back laughter at the absurdity of the situation. Shauna would periodically scrunch up her nose, trying to avoid the smell, but she would often break into a grin, unable to stifle her amusement at the dare they just completed. Each woman had her own distinct reaction to her scent. Tanya found it somewhat repulsive but laughed at the silliness of their actions, trying to make light of it. Lisa, embarrassed and amused, tried to distance herself from the smell by covering her nose. Shauna exhibited a mixture of sheer disbelief and amusement at what they had done, grinning despite the foul odor. To minimize contact between their soiled backsides and the couch cushions, the women employed various techniques. Tanya kept adjusting her position, lifting her hips off the couch by placing her hands under her thighs. Lisa tried to limit the contact by sitting on the edge of the couch and leaning forward on her knees, while Shauna shifted her weight from one side to another, attempting to avoid sitting directly on the mess they had created."},{"instruction":"How did Tanya try to make light of her scent and actions? Did any of the women touch her own bulge at any point?","output":"Tanya tried to make light of her scent and actions by laughing and cracking jokes to add humor to the bizarre situation. She said things like, \\"I guess it's not a party until you hit 'rock bottom', right?\\", and \\"I think we've just discovered a new method for clearing a room – guaranteed success!\\" Her lighthearted approach made the others laugh and feel less embarrassed or self-conscious about their actions. At one point during their awkwardly shuffling on the couch, Tanya momentarily touched the bulge in her pants. She did so with a combination of curiosity and disbelief, just to confirm the reality of what had just transpired. She then pulled her hand away quickly, shaking her head, and laughing at the absurdity. The other women didn't touch their own bulges, as they were more focused on trying to minimize the contact between their soiled pants and the couch cushions."},{"instruction":"Tell me more about Tanya touching her own bulge and about the way that the bulge felt against her hand. Did all the women in the scene manage to avoid sitting on top of their mess and squishing it?","output":"When Tanya touched the bulge in her pants, she did it cautiously and gently, not really sure what to expect. The bulge felt warm, soft, and squishy against her hand, as the mess had spread across her backside. She recoiled with a mixed expression of amusement and disgust but couldn't contain her laughter when she looked at the other women and saw their equally perplexed reactions. Despite their best efforts to minimize contact between their soiled pants and the couch cushions, it was difficult to avoid small instances of squishing the mess as they shifted their positions. Tanya's larger bulge occasionally pressed against the couch as she moved to adjust her seat. Lisa, sitting on the edge of the couch and trying to keep her thighs together, had a slightly better chance of not squishing her mess completely. Shauna, on the other hand, had limited success in avoiding the mess as she alternated her weight from one side to the other, inevitably causing some pressure against the bulge. While they couldn't entirely prevent squishing the mess, they did their best to minimize any damage to the couch and their clothing."},{"instruction":"在复z平面中，满足方程z²= | z |²的点集为？（A）两个点（B）圆（C）射线（D）直线","output":"首先，|z|^2=zcdot overline{z}=|z^2|，所以 z^2=|z|^2 可以转化为 z^2=|z^2|。 考虑到 |z^2| 看起来似乎不好处理，我们将其分解开来。因为 z^2 可以表示为 re^{itheta} 的形式，其中 r=|z|，theta 是与实轴正方向的夹角。所以 |z^2|=r^2=re^{0cdot i}。于是我们的方程就变成了： re^{itheta}=re^{0cdot i} 化简可得 r=0 或 theta=0，theta=pi。因为 r=|z|，所以 r=0 对应的是原点，不考虑进去。因为 theta=0 对应的是实轴上的点，而 theta=pi 对应的是虚轴上的点，也不符合条件。 于是，我们得到的点集就是一个点，也就是选项 textbf{(A)}。"},{"instruction":"检索关于无公害家用涂料的研究资料","output":"以下是关于无公害家用涂料的研究资料： 1. 商用环保涂料和家用环保涂料技术分析与市场前景研究 该论文从商用环保涂料和家用环保涂料技术的应用与不足之处入手，介绍了无公害家用涂料的相关技术及其市场前景的分析研究。该论文从现有的家用涂料技术入手，提出了环保涂料实现零甲醛的创新技术路线，探讨了家用涂料环保技术领域的市场前景与发展趋势。 2. 无公害家用涂料的研究现状与趋势分析 该论文介绍了无公害家用涂料的研究现状与趋势，同时对家用涂料的环保问题进行了深入分析，重点探讨了无公害家用涂料的研究和发展的现状与趋势，为无公害家用涂料技术的进一步研究提供了参考。 3. 无公害家用涂料的绿色制备技术及其应用研究 该论文从无公害家用涂料的制备技术与市场前景入手，探讨了绿色制备技术对家用涂料的环保性能的提升，同时分析了绿色制备技术在家用涂料领域的应用前景与发展趋势，为无公害家用涂料技术的实现提供了技术支持。 4. 无公害家用涂料的制备技术及配方优化研究 该论文介绍了无公害家用涂料的制备技术和配方优化方法，探讨了配方优化对家用涂料的质量和环保性能的提升，同时分析了无公害家用涂料在市场上的应用前景和发展趋势，为无公害家用涂料技术的实现提供了指导性建议。"},{"instruction":"检索关于无公害家用涂料的研究资料可以用什么外文数据库","output":"外文数据库的选择取决于你所在的机构或地区的订阅情况和你的研究需要。一些适合检索无公害家用涂料相关文献的外文数据库包括： 1.

In the Black Butler manga, Grell Sutcliff is portrayed as a flamboyant, gender-neutral character who is obsessed with death and has a complicated relationship with the protagonists. Grell is also shown to have a more tragic backstory, which explains their preoccupation with death and the reason for their love of Sebastian. In contrast, the anime adaptation of the series tones down Grell's flamboyance and gender-neutral characteristics, and focuses more on their obsession with Sebastian. Additionally, the anime does not delve as deep into Grell's backstory as the manga does. Fans of the manga may feel that the anime adaptation's portrayal of Grell is too different from their original impression of the character. They may believe that the anime neglects certain character traits or backstory details that are important to Grell's development.

However, the success of Walmart in Italy is dependent on a range of internal and external factors. One of the main advantages of internalization for Walmart in Italy is the potential for economies of scale, which can lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs. Internalization also allows Walmart to gain better control over their operations and tailor their policies to suit their business needs. This helps Walmart gain a more profound understanding of the local culture and consumer behavior in Italy and customize their marketing strategies, product offerings, and prices to appeal to the local market (Mennillo, 2012). Walmart also enjoys power bargaining advantages when dealing with local suppliers, thanks to its large-scale operations and global purchasing power (Bloomberg, 2019). However, the internalization process also comes with several disadvantages. One of the key disadvantages is the lack of local knowledge, which could lead to suboptimal business decisions. Establishing and managing stores in a foreign country can also be costly and risky, requiring Walmart to invest significant resources, navigate complex regulatory frameworks, and adapt to local business practices to avoid cultural misunderstandings that can ruin its reputation (Mennillo, 2012). To be successful in Italy, Walmart needs to leverage its core capabilities and resources, including advanced supply chain and logistics systems, brand recognition, marketing strategy, and data analytics and optimization strategies (Bloomberg, 2019). Walmart must also address several potential barriers to internalization, including strict regulatory landscape, competition from other established retailers, and cultural differences (Lorenzani, 2016). Overall, Walmart’s internalization strategy has helped the firm expand into foreign markets, and it could enable the company to be successful in Italy. However, the Italian market presents numerous challenges that require Walmart to adapt to the unique regulatory, cultural, and economic environment in Italy. Addressing these challenges effectively and leveraging their strengths can position Walmart for growth and market dominance in the Italian retail sector.","output":"Internationalisation: A Critical Analysis of Walmart's Expansion into Italy Internationalisation offers numerous benefits for companies, such as economies of scale, improved efficiency, and better control over operations. However, it also comes with challenges, including added costs, risks, and the need to adapt to local market conditions. For Walmart, a successful entry into the Italian market requires leveraging its internal resources and capabilities while addressing various internal and external factors. One primary advantage of internationalisation for Walmart in Italy is the potential for economies of scale, leading to increased efficiency and reduced costs. By expanding its business and opening more stores, Walmart can spread its fixed costs across a larger sales volume, lowering the average cost per unit and potentially improving profit margins (Mennillo, 2012). Furthermore, operating on a larger scale allows Walmart to take advantage of its significant bargaining power with suppliers, securing better deals that can lower input costs and lead to price competitiveness in the Italian retail market (Bloomberg, 2019). In addition to economies of scale, internationalisation allows Walmart to better control its operations and tailor its policies to match its business needs within Italy. Such control enables Walmart to gain a deeper understanding of local culture and consumer behaviour, allowing the company to customise its marketing strategies, product offerings, and pricing in a way that appeals to Italian consumers (Mennillo, 2012). Despite these advantages, internationalisation also presents several disadvantages for Walmart entering the Italian market. The lack of local knowledge can lead to suboptimal decision-making, which can negatively impact the company's business performance. Additionally, establishing and managing new stores in a foreign country may require significant investment and resources, as well as the need to navigate complex regulatory frameworks, adapt to local business practices, and avoid cultural misunderstandings that could harm Walmart's reputation (Mennillo, 2012). To succeed in Italy, Walmart needs to leverage its core capabilities and resources, including its advanced supply chain and logistics systems, strong brand recognition, marketing expertise, and data analytics and optimisation strategies (Bloomberg, 2019). However, the company also faces potential barriers to internationalisation, such as Italy's strict regulatory environment, competition from well-established retailers, and cultural differences that may impact consumer preferences (Lorenzani, 2016). A critical analysis of Walmart's internationalisation strategy indicates that while it has been successful in other foreign markets, the Italian market presents unique challenges requiring the company to adapt to the specific regulatory, cultural, and economic environment. These challenges and disadvantages can be mitigated through a thorough understanding of the local market, effective management of resources, and the development of targeted strategies that cater to Italian consumers. In conclusion, Walmart's internationalisation strategy has the potential to be successful in Italy, as long as it effectively addresses the challenges presented by the Italian market. By leveraging its strengths and adapting to the local business landscape, Walmart can position itself for growth and potentially secure a dominant position within the Italian retail sector."},{"instruction":"Generate a complete and appropriate UWE referencing section for the following essay Introduction International business is an increasingly complex field that requires a deep understanding of the intricacies of multinational companies entering foreign markets. Walmart’s investment opportunity in Italy provides an excellent case study to apply Dunning’s eclectic paradigm. We will use OLI framework to critically assess Walmart’s investment opportunity in Italy. This analysis will consider the ownership, location, and internalization components of the OLI paradigm, along with cultural and legal factors that impact Walmart’s operations in Italy. Understanding the complexities of multinational companies’ investments in foreign markets is essential, and this essay aims to provide insights that will assist Walmart in making strategic decisions that contribute to its global success. Dunning’s eclectic paradigm and critique of OLI Dunning’s eclectic paradigm is a framework used to understand the motives behind multinational companies’ investments in foreign markets. The model is based on three components; ownership, location, and internalization (OLI). According to Dunning (1980), ownership refers to the ownership-specific advantages of the multinational company, location reflects the advantages of the foreign country in which the investment is made, and internalization refers to the advantages of managing the investment internally. However, while Dunning’s eclectic paradigm has become popular in international business literature, its efficacy has been called into question. Critics such as Cantwell and Narula (2001) and Zaheer (1995) have raised concerns about Dunning’s eclectic paradigm, or the OLI framework. They argue that the theory overlooks cultural and institutional disparities across nations, which could result in its inability to clarify why a specific strategy may thrive in one country but fail in another. Moreover, these analysts, including Rugman (1981) and Eden and Dai (1996), also assert that the OLI framework does not consider the importance of the host country’s market structure and how it may affect the multinational corporation’s (MNC) operations and success. Recent studies have called for a revision of the OLI paradigm, including the integration of contemporary theories such as institutional theory, resource-based theory, and competitors’ analysis (Bellak et al., 2018). For example, Peng (2017) argues that it is necessary to integrate institutional factors into the OLI paradigm to effectively explain why some strategies might work in some countries and not in others. Similarly, Verbeke (2013) emphasizes that the OLI framework should incorporate a network perspective to capture the dynamics of the relationships between the MNC and different stakeholders. In addition to the criticisms of the OLI framework, some scholars argue that the model overlooks the importance of global value chains (GVCs) and the role they play in multinational corporations’ investments (Gereffi et al., 2019). With the advent of technology and new forms of digital trade, GVCs play a crucial role in multinational corporations’ operations and strategies. Therefore, while Dunning’s eclectic paradigm has become a crucial framework for analyzing multinational corporations’ investments in foreign markets, recent studies highlight its weaknesses and call for the integration of contemporary theories to capture the complexities of the current global business environment. Ownership The ownership component within Dunning’s eclectic paradigm (OLI) framework emphasizes the assessment of a firm’s competitive advantages based on its unique resources or capabilities (Dunning, 2000). Walmart, being the world’s largest retailer, has consistently utilized its considerable resources and capabilities to achieve global success (Fortune Global 500, 2021). Some of these resources include its economies of scale, vast distribution networks, and advanced supply chain management techniques (Pappas et al., 2020). In theory, these ownership advantages should provide Walmart with a strong foundation for growth potential within the Italian market. It is essential to focus on Walmart’s strengths- such as its capacity to leverage economies of scale to increase market share, as evidenced in other markets - and weaknesses, while examining the competition in the Italian retail sector. For example, Walmart’s economies of scale have allowed the company to reduce costs and gain a competitive advantage through various methods, such as bulk purchasing, vertical integration, and streamlining supply chain processes. In China, Walmart utilized these advantages to rapidly expand its presence, becoming one of the largest foreign retailers in the country. By offering lower prices and more extensive product selections than domestic competitors, Walmart attracted millions of Chinese consumers and increased its market share (Chan & Zhang, 2011). With its strengths in cost control, distribution, and supply chain management, Walmart has the potential to confront the challenges posed by the Italian market, such as adapting to the culturally-sensitive environment and catering to the preferences of Italian consumers that value quality and authenticity. To overcome these barriers, Walmart can leverage its resources to invest in research and collaborate with local suppliers to ensure quality, locally-sourced products while maintaining its low-price guarantee. This approach can help the company to build trust and loyalty among Italian customers, which is crucial for market penetration in Italy (Hitt et al., 2011). Walmart’s ownership advantages also empower the company to explore strategic alliances, mergers, or acquisitions in Italy, potentially providing entry into the Italian retail sector. As mentioned previously, Walmart’s partnership with Grupo Éxito, a Colombian retail company, in 1994 demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully enter foreign markets through strategic collaborations (Gaviria & Meléndez, 2006). In sum, Walmart’s ownership advantages, particularly its economies of scale and supply chain capabilities, play a crucial role in the company’s potential success in the Italian market. By focusing on these strengths, Walmart can develop a strategic plan that addresses the unique challenges and preferences of the Italian retail landscape. This will allow the company to better position itself within Italy, potentially achieving similar success that it has accomplished in other foreign markets. However, it is essential for Walmart to carefully consider and balance all aspects of the OLI framework, including location and internalization advantages, to build a comprehensive strategy for its investment or operations in Italy. Location Foremost, the cultural aspect of Italy is an important factor that can impact Walmart’s entry into the market. As a country with a rich and unique cultural heritage, Italy is characterized by strong local traditions and habits in consumer behavior, which may pose challenges to Walmart’s standardization strategies (Perri et al., 2014). For example, Italian consumers tend to place significant value on local products, artisanal craftsmanship, and small-scale retail operations (Cappellini et al., 2016) which could present a disadvantage for Walmart, as they may struggle to gain acceptance in the market. Moreover, some critics argue that Walmart’s emphasis on low prices and high volume might not resonate well with the preferences of Italian consumers, who typically prioritize quality and authenticity over cost savings (Cainelli et al., 2015). Economically, Italy is a mature market with a relatively high competition in the retail sector. Walmart is likely to face strong competition from domestic retailers such as Conad and Coop, which have extensive experience in the local market and deep relationships with local suppliers. Additionally, international retail chains such as Carrefour and Lidl have a presence in the Italian market, which increases the level of competition Walmart is likely to face. Additionally, the country has been facing prolonged economic stagnation, with the retail industry being affected significantly by a lack of consumer demand and decreasing purchasing power (Reilly, 2021). In this context, Walmart could face challenges in achieving its growth and profitability targets, as the overall propensity for consumption in the country remains subdued (Banchero et al., 2019). Furthermore, the highly fragmented nature of the Italian retail market, with a large presence of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), can further intensify competition and make market penetration more difficult for Walmart (Valentina et al., 2017). Legally speaking, the regulatory environment in Italy can be complex, and difficulties in navigating the business landscape may pose challenges for Walmart’s entry and operations in the market (Del Baldo et al., 2019). For instance, bureaucratic processes related to permits and licenses might slow down Walmart’s expansion plans in the country, while stringent labor laws and regulations could potentially affect the flexibility and cost of its workforce (Mangiarotti et al., 2016). Additionally, as highlighted by Meliszewski and Lupo (2019), the country’s stringent environmental regulations might also require Walmart to adapt its operational model to comply with local standards, potentially increasing its overall cost base. However, despite the mentioned challenges, Walmart could leverage its global scale and supply chain expertise to negotiate favorable deals with Italian suppliers, thereby potentially offsetting some of the location disadvantages (Dunning, 2008). Furthermore, as noted by Hernandez et al. (2017), Walmart has been successful in adapting its offering and operational strategies to local market conditions in the past, and such experience could prove useful in the Italian context. For example, Walmart could focus on enhancing its private label offerings with high-quality, locally sourced products, which might better resonate with Italian consumers and allow the company to differentiate itself from local competition (Donvito et al., 2016). Overall, while cultural, economic, and legal factors might pose significant challenges, the company’s international experience and capabilities can potentially be leveraged to overcome these hurdles and achieve a competitive position in the market and to do this, Walmart would need to maintain a careful balance between the standardization of its global strategies and the adaptation to the unique features of the Italian market. Internationalisation Internationalisation offers numerous benefits for companies, such as economies of scale, improved efficiency, and better control over operations. However, it also comes with challenges, including added costs, risks, and the need to adapt to local market conditions. For Walmart, a successful entry into the Italian market requires leveraging its internal resources and capabilities while addressing various internal and external factors. One primary advantage of internationalisation for Walmart in Italy is the potential for economies of scale, leading to increased efficiency and reduced costs. By expanding its business and opening more stores, Walmart can spread its fixed costs across a larger sales volume, lowering the average cost per unit and potentially improving profit margins (Mennillo, 2012). Furthermore, operating on a larger scale allows Walmart to take advantage of its significant bargaining power with suppliers, securing better deals that can lower input costs and lead to price competitiveness in the Italian retail market (Bloomberg, 2019). In addition to economies of scale, internationalisation allows Walmart to better control its operations and tailor its policies to match its business needs within Italy. Such control enables Walmart to gain a deeper understanding of local culture and consumer behaviour, allowing the company to customise its marketing strategies, product offerings, and pricing in a way that appeals to Italian consumers (Mennillo, 2012). Despite these advantages, internationalisation also presents several disadvantages for Walmart entering the Italian market. The lack of local knowledge can lead to suboptimal decision-making, which can negatively impact the company’s business performance. Additionally, establishing and managing new stores in a foreign country may require significant investment and resources, as well as the need to navigate complex regulatory frameworks, adapt to local business practices, and avoid cultural misunderstandings that could harm Walmart’s reputation (Mennillo, 2012).

Overall, Walmart’s internationalisation strategy has the potential to be successful in Italy, as long as it effectively addresses the challenges presented by the Italian market. By leveraging its strengths and adapting to the local business landscape, Walmart can position itself for growth and potentially secure a dominant position within the Italian retail sector. Conclusion In conclusion, Walmart's investment opportunity in Italy serves as an excellent case study to apply Dunning's eclectic paradigm. However, recent studies have highlighted weaknesses in the OLI framework, emphasizing the need for the integration of contemporary theories to capture the complexities of the current global business environment. The ownership component of the OLI framework emphasizes the assessment of a firm's competitive advantages based on its unique resources or capabilities, which determines the extent to which a firm can exploit its ownership advantages or disadvantages in the foreign market. In theory, Walmart's ownership advantages should offer significant growth potential within the Italian market. However, cultural differences, the entrenched nature of local businesses, and the highly competitive landscape may limit Walmart's success in the Italian market. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of Walmart's ownership, location, and internalization advantages is essential to make strategic decisions that contribute to its global success.","output":"References Banchero, R., Scagnetti, M., & Canullo, G.

As they chatted, a gust of wind suddenly blew into the garden, lifting up the dresses of the ladies and revealing their panties to Pierre. The ladies were embarrassed by what just happened and frantically tried to pull down their dresses, but it was too late. Pierre froze as he tried to avert his eyes but couldn't help but to glance at the unexpected sight before him. The ladies felt embarrassed and awkward, but they tried to keep their composure and brushed it off as if nothing had happened. After a few moments of silence, Pierre apologized for staring and immediately looked away, but the ladies laughed it off and told him not to worry as they knew it was not his fault. They resumed their tea gathering and continued their conversation as if nothing had occurred. As the day went on, the ladies realized that Pierre was a kind and gentle man who meant no harm, and they did not hold what had happened against him. They fondly remembered their tea party, but they also made sure that their dresses were properly fitted next time the wind blew."},{"instruction":"Write this story but make it longer and with more dialogue too","output":"Pierre sat in the garden of the house sipping on his tea as he chatted with a group of ladies. One of the ladies, Mrs. Anderson, had invited him to have tea with her friends. It was a beautiful afternoon in late spring, and the sun was shining, birds were singing, and the flowers were in full bloom. The atmosphere was serene and tranquil, which Pierre desperately needed after a long week at work. Mrs. Anderson and her friends were all middle-aged and lovely. They all wore dainty sundresses and had wide-brimmed hats that covered their eyes. Pierre couldn't help but think how beautiful they looked, and he thanked Mrs. Anderson repeatedly for the invitation. The ladies talked and laughed together, sharing life stories about their husbands, children, and careers. Pierre listened attentively, occasionally adding a French phrase or two, and the ladies giggled at his accent, which they found adorable. As they chatted, a gust of wind suddenly blew into the garden, lifting up the dresses of the ladies and revealing their panties to Pierre. The ladies were embarrassed by what just happened and frantically tried to pull down their dresses, but it was too late. Pierre froze, not knowing where to look and felt his face turn red. He apologized profusely, but the ladies laughed it off and told him not to worry as they knew it was not his fault. \\"It's not like we could have stopped the wind from blowing after all,\\" one of them said, amused. After a few moments of silence, Pierre broke it with his French accent trembling, \\"I- I am so sorry, madame. I did not know where to look, and I did not want to offend you.\\" \\"Please, Pierre, it's all right. We know it wasn't your fault,\\" Mrs. Anderson replied, patting Pierre's hand. \\"Thank you, Mrs. Anderson. I am such a klutz,\\" Pierre said again. \\"It's nothing. We all know accidents happen,\\" Mrs. Anderson said, pulling out a fresh plate of scones from her basket. Later, as they resumed their tea party, Mrs. Anderson and the other ladies realized that Pierre was a kind and gentle man who meant no harm. They fondly remembered their tea gathering as an amusing anecdote and genuinely enjoyed Pierre's company. \\"So, Pierre, tell us about your country,\\" one of the ladies, Mrs. Jackson, asked, \\"Is Paris really the city of love as they say it is?\\" Pierre lit up with a smile and began sharing stories about his country, the museums, the music, the food, and everything in between. He talked about how romantic Paris was, and how it was a city that reminded him of love. \\"After all, amour is the French word for love, and to us, love is an art,\\" Pierre said, chuckling. The ladies listened intently, fascinated by his words, and they shared their own stories from their travels around France. They talked till the sun went down, and Pierre felt he had made true friends. As the day went on, the ladies realized that Pierre was a kind and gentle man, and they did not hold what had happened against him. They fondly remembered their tea party, but they also made sure that their dresses were properly fitted next time the wind blew.

Everyone was having a wonderful time until a gust of wind blew into the garden, lifting the ladies' dresses and revealing their panties. The ladies were horrified by what had just happened, and they covered themselves up, feeling embarrassed and ashamed. Pierre saw the looks of terror in their eyes, and he felt nothing but sympathy for them. He knew that they had just experienced an uncomfortable situation and that there was no way to erase that memory from their minds. \\"I'm so sorry, ladies,\\" Pierre said, offering a reassuring smile. \\"I didn't mean to cause any trouble. Please forgive me.\\" The ladies glanced at each other, unsure of what to say. They didn't want to make Pierre feel bad, but they were still horrified by the experience. \\"It's not your fault, Pierre,\\" Mrs. Anderson said, her voice shaking. \\"It was just the wind.\\" \\"But still, we feel so exposed,\\" Mrs. Winston chimed in, her cheeks red. Pierre understood how they felt, and he knew that he needed to do something to help them feel better. \\"I understand that this must have been traumatic for you, and I apologize for what happened,\\" he said. \\"Please know that there is nothing to be embarrassed about. It was just an accident.\\" The ladies looked at Pierre, reassured by his words. He was behaving so kindly, and they could see that he meant what he said. They began to calm down as he spoke. \\"It's okay, Pierre,\\" Mrs. Jackson said, her voice barely above a whisper. Pierre smiled, relieved that the ladies were beginning to feel more relaxed. \\"Thank you for understanding,\\" he said, taking a sip of his tea. \\"Perhaps we can change the subject and continue enjoying each other's company.\\" The ladies nodded, grateful for Pierre's words. They began talking again, but this time, the subject wasn't as light-hearted as before. They spoke about their fears and insecurities, and they were amazed at how much they had in common. The afternoon passed quickly, and as the sun began to set, the ladies realized that they had had a wonderful time despite the uncomfortable incident that had occurred earlier in the day. As they said their goodbyes, they hugged Pierre, thanking him for being such a kind and thoughtful gentleman. They had all been worried about how the day would turn out, but in the end, everything had fallen into place, thanks to Pierre's kindness and consideration. As Pierre walked away, he felt grateful for the experience. He knew that he had made a real difference in the ladies' lives, and that made him feel proud.

It is so uncomfortable.\\" The other ladies nodded in agreement, and Pierre understood the sentiment. It was something he had felt before, but he had never imagined that it was something that could happen at a tea party too. \\"Mrs. Winston, I am sorry to hear that you felt uncomfortable,\\" Pierre said, trying to be supportive. \\"Yes, it's frustrating,\\" Mrs. Anderson added, \\"I always make sure to go before I come to these events, but sometimes, that isn't enough.\\" \\"I totally agree with you ladies,\\" Mrs. Jackson joined in, \\"It is very awkward to hold your pee and pretend that everything is okay.\\" Pierre felt that the conversation was getting a bit uncomfortable, but he also knew how relatable this felt. \\"I am sorry to hear that you have faced this experience. Maybe we can make sure to ask for an accessible and open bathroom next time,\\" he suggested. \\"That's a great idea,\\" Mrs. Winston said, smiling at Pierre. \\"We should try to make sure that everyone feels comfortable, no matter what.\\" The conversation moved on to other topics, but the tea party had a bit of a relaxed and lighthearted tone. The ladies continued to sip on their tea, enjoying each other's company, with Pierre occasionally chiming in with a laugh or two. As the party was drawing to a close, Pierre couldn't help but think about the importance of finding accessible and safe places, even when it comes to holding pee. It might be a small thing, but it can make a big difference to someone's comfort and sense of dignity, no matter the occasion. The ladies were grateful for the discussion led by Mrs. Winston, and they said their goodbyes, with a greater sense of awareness about their needs at tea parties.

Vampires in this world view mortals as an inferior species, particularly due to their ticklish feet (which makes forcing them into submission curses more effective and furthermore, tickling is viewed as the proper way a responsible footslave owner should punish her footslaves should they slip up). Elder vampires possess magical eyes, which allow them to see the thoughts, and weaknesess of any mortal. Vampires are impossible to distinguish from mortals, which leads them to infiltrate normal society. Usually when one realises they are dealing with a vampire, it is too late.

Proud but overconfident, she would never submit to such a creature— well, that's what she believes. Themes: coercion, subjugation, the ingenuity and inevitability of vampiric schemes, the slow but inevitable slip into submission, the acceptance of true inferiority of being ticklish, the perverse love found in the eventual subjugation to the worship of vampiric feet, and the humbling of arrogant mortals, the long and arduous process of shattering pride through tickling.

None were more feared and reviled, though, than the vampires—monsters that preyed on the life essence of others, viewing them as inferior beings. They infiltrated society with ease, their visages indistinguishable from the mortals they lived among. Often, by the time one realized they were dealing with a vampire, it was already too late. In this world of darkness, amongst the shadows of the night, walked a lithe, dark elf of stunning beauty. She was a vampire-hunter by profession, determined to rid the world of the fiends who took pleasure in the torture and subjugation of mortals. This elf, whose name was Liraleth, bespoke of mystery and grace, and in her beauty, it was said that she held a dark secret. Her feet were said to be the most elegant and perfect, but so tremendously ticklish that she could not bear even the slightest touch. But this secret she guarded fiercely, never allowing it to compromise her mission. One evening, as Liraleth strolled through the market square, she became aware of a beautiful dark-haired woman, indistinguishable from a mortal, but emanating an aura that bespoke of something much more sinister. This mysterious woman was tall, with smooth ivory skin, her eyes as black as obsidian, and raven locks that cascaded down her back in waves. Her full lips painted crimson seemed to perpetually curve in a knowing smile, and when they parted, the flash of razor-sharp fangs glistened in the moonlight. The vampire, known as The Footmistress, had a particular fascination with the feet of others, especially women. She delighted in the forced submission of her victims, exploiting their ticklishness and ensnaring them in a magical curse. This curse would bind her victims in eternal servitude, casting them down to the humiliating position of footslave—completely devoted to the worship of their vampire mistress' feet, and offering their own in return. As they locked eyes, Liraleth could see that The Footmistress was eyeing her with great interest, a predatory glint gleaming in those onyx orbs. The elf stiffened, her nape bristling with unease, but refused to back down. She crossed the distance between them, acutely aware of the growing danger in their encounter. \\"You have the eyes of a predator,\\" Liraleth said bitterly, her voice dripping with contempt. \\"I know what you are.\\" A ripple of amusement crossed The Footmistress' face, her well-shaped eyebrows raising in playful surprise. \\"And what might that be, darling elf?\\" she inquired sweetly, her voice a sinister whisper. She could sense Liraleth's hidden secret, the alluring presence of her delicately ticklish feet, the perfect tool to humble her newfound adversary. Oh, how she longed to hear her laughter shatter her pride, and watch as her resistance crumbled at the hands of her greatest weakness. \\"You seek only the disgrace and degradation of others,\\" Liraleth spat. \\"But I will never submit to you!\\" The Footmistress thrilled at Liraleth's bold declaration, even as she prepared to unleash her cunning and silver-tongued skills. \\"Ah, but is that truly what I am after?\\" she crooned, her voice oozing with deceitful charm. \\"I simply wish to elevate mortals to their rightful position, to help them embrace their flawed beauty.\\" \\"How could their feet possibly matter?\\" Liraleth challenged, her voice shaking with fury. \\"Ah, but you see, it's not their feet alone,\\" The Footmistress purred lasciviously. \\"It's their weakness—the ticklishness of their feet. The way their laughter shakes their mortal frames and shatters their pride. There is no greater pleasure than the absolute surrender of a willing or coerced footslave.\\" The dark elf's face flushed with both anger and shame, defiance burning in her deep ocean-blue eyes. She glanced down at The Footmistress' own feet, encased in the softest black silk slippers, her high arches gracefully curving and her long, slender toes tantalizingly visible. They were regal and seductive, the epitome of elegance—and Liraleth could not keep the involuntary shiver of fear that raced down her spine at the thought of ever having to touch those feet. \\"Your schemes and manipulations may have worked on others, but not me,\\" Liraleth managed. \\"I will not be subdued by someone so perverse.\\" The Footmistress regarded her coolly, the earlier warmth in her voice gone now, her eyes boring into Liraleth's soul, reading her deepest desires and fears. \\"Oh, you are a headstrong one,\\" she admitted, a hint of admiration coloring her tone. \\"But you should know that your perfect, tender feet are no match for me. I will have them, willingly or unwillingly, and you will fall powerless before me.\\" A chill raced up Liraleth's spine, and a cold sweat broke out on her forehead. But she stood her ground, her defiant gaze unwavering. \\"You may think you have power over me, but I will never bow to you!\\" she exclaimed, her voice cracking only slightly with steely resolve. The Footmistress simply smiled, a dangerous, seductive promise dancing in her enchanting eyes. \\"We shall see, my dear.\\" And with a whisper of darkness and the faintest trace of lilac, she vanished, leaving Liraleth standing in the cold night, her heart pounding and her stomach clenching with dread. For both The Footmistress and Liraleth knew this was just the beginning of their twisted dance, a cruel interlude where pride and submission would be tested and love would be born from the most perverse of places.

The dark elf refused to concede her pride, even as the memory of their meeting haunted her every waking moment. The tantalizing images of The Footmistress' perfectly manicured, slender digits seemed to remain etched into her mind's eye – a cruel reminder of the danger she now faced. Despite her tenacity, Liraleth couldn't deny the subtle changes that had taken over her once-focused demeanor. She found herself glancing frequently down at her own exquisite feet, paranoid and mindful of their undeniable vulnerability. Her dark, smooth arches curved to perfection, as if created solely to ensnare the desires of those who were drawn to worship at their fragile altar. Delicate, lustrously trimmed toes flexed nervously, emphasizing the soft, sensitive skin beneath them. Yet, she could not ignore the truth: her precious feet held the key to her eventual downfall. Their unparalleled ticklishness was an undesired weak point she hoped The Footmistress would not exploit. The mere thought of being brought to her knees, shackled in laughter by the delicate touch of another, sent chills racing up her spine. It was on a moonlit night, filled with foreboding, that The Footmistress appeared before her once again. The vampire's beguiling beauty had only seemed to grow in their time apart, her mysterious aura emanating both seductive grace and dark intent. Her obsidian eyes, deep and penetrating, never wavered from Liraleth's apprehensive gaze; they seemed two bottomless pits that promised total submission to those who ventured too close. \\"Dear Liraleth,\\" The Footmistress purred, her voice smooth and enchanting, \\"have you given thought to our last encounter?\\" \\"We have nothing left to discuss, you twisted creature,\\" Liraleth snapped, feigning an assured bravado she barely felt. \\"My pride will never yield to your perversion and nefarious desires.\\" \\"How naïve,\\" The Footmistress taunted, her tone dripping with disingenuous sympathy. \\"If you only knew the blissful surrender you deny yourself...\\" Nearby, the flitting shadows cast an eerie scene of dark shapes on the cold stone, their elusive dance threatening to entwine her with a web of shadows. Slowly, The Footmistress approached, her wicked grin indicating the impending danger. \\"Spare me your feigned concern,\\" Liraleth spat, as her eyes glanced once again towards The Footmistress' silken-slippers. \\"I will never become the plaything of a foul monster such as yourself.\\" \\"Lovely Liraleth,\\" The Footmistress cooed, her voice dripping with insidious sweetness. \\"Do you truly believe you can escape the lure of the darkness within you? No matter how earnestly you resist, it yearns for the touch that will stoke the secret desires you hide within your heart.\\" Liraleth's cheeks burned with humiliation, as her secret fears threatened to expose her true self. Yet, despite her trepidation, a part of her ached for the release The Footmistress suggested, an admission she loathed. \\"You speak of nothing but lies and malicious intent,\\" Liraleth countered, her voice quivering with a fierce resolve that she struggled to maintain. \\"You cannot ignore the truth, my dear,\\" The Footmistress purred, her eyes narrowing into dark slits that promised a revenant's retribution. \\"Our fates are intertwined, and your will cannot outlast the darkness that calls to us both.\\" Feeling cornered, Liraleth's retort slipped from her lips like a desperate plea. \\"I will never embrace such perversion! Your twisted fantasies hold no power over me!\\" The Footmistress' laughter was a sinister melody that haunted the night, echoing off the walls around them. \\"Your courage is quaint, and yet so misguided,\\" she whispered. \\"But we will meet again, and soon, you shall learn the meaning of true submission.\\" And with a swirl of shadows and an unmistakable air of menace, The Footmistress vanished once more. Liraleth, her heart pounding in her chest as the weight of her vulnerability began to crush her spirit, knew that the days of her untarnished pride were numbered. The perilous anticipation of their future encounters filled her with a dread that coiled deep within her being. As the relentless pull of The Footmistress' unyielding grasp threatened her very essence, Liraleth found herself inextricably drawn closer to the inevitable: a shattering of her proud exterior, the fall toward the sinful worship of vampiric feet, and an unwavering subjugation to the whims of a cunning, immortal predator."},{"instruction":"I say ping, you say pong.

He was hospitalized in a conscious, aware, and stable condition and subsequently underwent surgery. After the surgery, he was placed in double long leg casts, back brace, and neck brace. However, during the operation, he was intubated and catheterized. Despite successfully regaining consciousness, the endotracheal tube and Foley catheter were kept in for an additional three days. This medical report focuses on the reasons behind Reza Fazekas's relatively prolonged intubation and catheterization. Patient Information: Reza Fazekas is a 25-year-old male who was involved in a car accident. He was admitted to the hospital with multiple injuries including a head injury, fractures in both legs, and a back injury. Medical History: Reza Fazekas has no significant medical history prior to the car accident. Physical Examination: On admission, Reza Fazekas was conscious and stable. However, he had multiple injuries including a head injury, fractures in both legs, and a back injury. He was placed in double long leg casts, a back brace, and a neck brace after the surgery. The injuries were managed by a multidisciplinary team including orthopedic surgeons, neurologists, and pulmonologists. Management: During the surgery, Reza Fazekas was intubated and catheterized. The surgery lasted for about four hours, and the patient was successfully extubated after the surgery. However, the endotracheal tube and Foley catheter were kept in for an additional three days. Reasons for Relatively Prolonged Intubation: The decision to keep the endotracheal tube in for an additional three days was based on several factors. Firstly, Reza Fazekas had sustained a head injury, which required close monitoring for potential complications such as brain swelling. Secondly, he had a history of asthma, which made him susceptible to respiratory distress. Additionally, he had undergone surgery on his back and legs, which made it difficult for him to move and cough efficiently, putting him at risk of developing pneumonia. By keeping the endotracheal tube in, Reza Fazekas's airway was secured, and he received optimal ventilation, oxygenation, and suctioning. The endotracheal tube also allowed for more effective management of pain and imbalanced blood gases. Reasons for Relatively Prolonged Catheterization: Reza Fazekas was catheterized during the surgery and remained catheterized for an additional three days. The decision to keep him catheterized was based on several factors. Firstly, he was unable to move his legs due to the fractures, making it difficult to walk to the restroom. Secondly, he was on pain medication that caused constipation and difficulty with bladder emptying. Finally, he had a back injury that made it difficult for him to adjust his position, making it difficult for the nursing staff to put him on a bedpan. By keeping Reza Fazekas catheterized, his bladder was emptied regularly, reducing the risk of urinary tract infections. Additionally, the nursing staff was able to monitor his urine output, which provided important clinical information about his hydration status. Conclusion: Reza Fazekas is a young journalist who sustained multiple injuries in a suspicious car accident. After undergoing surgery, he was placed on double long leg casts, a back brace, and a neck brace. During the surgery, he was intubated and catheterized. Despite successfully regaining consciousness, the endotracheal tube and Foley catheter were kept in for an additional three days. This decision was made based on several factors, including the need for close monitoring of his head injury, his history of asthma, and his inability to move efficiently post-surgery. By keeping him intubated and catheterized, his airway was secured, and his bladder was emptied regularly, reducing the risk of associated complications."},{"instruction":"Generate the first chapter in a slow, and twisted enemies-lovers style story from the perspective of the elf, and her first of many meetings with a mysterious stranger; in salacious detail; focusing on dialogue; generated to maximum length; with the following setting, characters and themes: Setting: Medieval fantasy world. Vampires in this world view mortals as an inferior species, particularly due to their ticklish feet (which makes forcing them into submission curses more effective and furthermore, tickling is viewed as the proper way a responsible footslave owner should punish her footslaves should they slip up). Elder vampires possess magical eyes, which allow them to see the thoughts, and weaknesess of any mortal. Vampires are impossible to distinguish from mortals, which leads them to infiltrate normal society. Usually when one realises they are dealing with a vampire, it is too late. They are reviled by the populace, but also feared. Characters: A mysterious woman of dark beauty, indistinguishable from a mortal but really an elder vampire known as \\"The Footmistress\\", she is cunning, silver-tongued and disingenuous; she has as a love of women's feet, particularly that of virgins; through her knowledge of tickling, her dark powers, and ingenious cunning, as well as her magical vampire eyes that allow her to read minds and discern people's weaknesses, she plots to acquire a new footslave: one totally devoted and loving of their mistress' feet, as well as offering their own feet to them to be used as their mistress sees fit, and binding them with magical and eternal curse that requires the victim to perform a humiliating foot ritual, either through coercion or with their consent; who views mortals, especially ticklish ones, as an inferior species— easily disciplined through their ticklish feet, making them perfect and beloved pets. And that of a proud high-elf courtier and heir to a noble house, who secretly has elegant, graceful, and truly perfect feet, harbouring a secret she keeps far inside herself, one she would never admit to even if cornered, or confronted: the unparalleled ticklishness of those feet— she cannot stand being tickled. Proud but overconfident, she would never submit to such a creature— well, that's what she believes. Themes: coercion, subjugation, the ingenuity and inevitability of vampiric schemes, the slow but inevitable slip into submission, the acceptance of true inferiority of being ticklish, the perverse love found in the eventual subjugation to the worship of vampiric feet, and the humbling of arrogant mortals, the long and arduous process of shattering pride through tickling.

The lofty architecture, with its delicate archways and intricate murals, gave the impression of a high and noble culture untouched by the ravages of time. In many ways, this was true. One could not help but feel overwhelmed by both the beauty and the presence of history that surrounded them. Yet, in this world of quiet order, there thrived dark forces that sought to turn the very foundations of this society on its head. Among the glittering jewels and gilded tapestries, creatures of the night laid in wait: vampires, thirsty for the lifeblood of their prey and seeking solace in shadows. Invisible in their cunning deception, they infiltrated the world above, striking when their victims were at their most vulnerable. This tale begins with one such creature: a woman of great beauty, known only as the Footmistress. The ways of her kind were twisted and dark, and none more so than her own. She was a creature renowned for her silver-tongued skill, her ingenuity in creating damning curses, and her particularly insidious predilection for tickling the feet of her victims, delighting in their helplessness and forced submission. Her midnight eyes were sharp and calculating, taking in every detail of her surroundings even as her thoughts danced to the beat of her wicked heart. It was said that through her eyes, she could peer into the minds of those she wished to ensnare and could unravel their deepest desires. Her latest prey was an elf maiden, a courtier of noble birth and one of the high-elven race. Liriel, as she was named, was elegant and beautiful, with hair the color of moonlight and eyes the shade of deep, dark pools. Her form was slender and supple, her skin as fair as snow, and her manner proud and stately, befitting the proud line of nobility from which she was descended. The Footmistress had set her sights upon her, knowing that she was the key to one of her most cunning plans yet. Liriel had one secret, kept far from the prying eyes of her fellow elves. Her true curse lay in her feet, which were extraordinary in their beauty, but even more so in their sensitivity to the touch. Long, graceful toes were capped by the smallest, palest cornelian nails, ever so slightly curved and marbled with veins like azure gems; insteps were of perfect arch, utterly smooth with not a single flaw or blemish to mar their perfection. Her soles, so exquisitely tender and vulnerable, were almost agonizingly lovely to behold. For Liriel's feet were ticklish, more so than any mortal's should be allowed. She knew that this was something she must keep from the world, lest she be ridiculed or shunned. It was a secret that filled her with bitter shame, and one which she hid at all costs. This was the day that the Footmistress would confront her, in a quiet moment when they were alone. The vampire approached Liriel as she sat, alone and thoughtful, in the solitude of the castle's gardens, her keen eyes raking over the elegance of the elf's delicate features. \\"Good day, my lady,\\" she began, her voice smooth and sultry as the purr of a cat, \\"I hope you find the garden to your liking.\\" Liriel raised her eyes to meet the gaze of the newcomer. She was intrigued by this mysterious woman, unable to discern her true intentions, but somehow drawn to her dark allure. \\"Your company is unexpected but not unwelcome, stranger,\\" replied Liriel, her voice melodic and clear. \\"To whom do I owe this pleasure?\\" The Footmistress smiled, her lips curling like the petals of a deadly flower. \\"I have heard of your beauty, Lady Liriel, and I have come to offer you a gift befitting one so fair as you.\\" \\"A gift?\\" inquired Liriel, raising a slender eyebrow. \\"And what would that be?\\" The Footmistress stepped closer, her eyes never wavering from Liriel's as she murmured in tones so low they were barely audible, \\"You know what I would give you, elf. You know and you desire it, even if your conscious mind recoils at the thought.\\" Liriel's breath caught in her throat, her pulse quickening as she fought to maintain her composure. \\"You presume too much, stranger,\\" she replied, her voice tinged with trepidation. \\"Your intentions may not be as innocent as you would have me believe.\\" The Footmistress chuckled, a sound like the tinkling of dark, cursed stars. \\"Oh, innocence is far from my mind, dear Liriel. I would give you a gift you can never refuse: the gift of my eternal bond.\\" The noble elf faltered, feeling as though she was teetering on the very edge of the abyss. \\"An eternal bond? With you? I cannot... I would never...\\" The vampire reached out, brushing her hand ever so lightly against Liriel's ankle, and felt the shiver that ran through her very soul. She reveled in the feel of the tender flesh, knowing that she had struck upon the elf's deepest vulnerability. \\"You cannot resist me, my fair one,\\" she whispered, her voice weaving an insidious web. \\"Your heart knows that you crave my touch, even if your mind denies it. Imagine the exquisite pleasure of my fingers upon your feet, my nails tracing arcane patterns across your delicate, sensitive soles…\\" Liriel's eyes widened in horror as she realized what was meant, her heart pounding like a trapped bird in her chest. \\"No,\\" she breathed, \\"I will not submit, not to you, not to this perversion.\\" The Footmistress smiled, savoring the slow creeping dread that seized Liriel's once-proud heart. \\"You have no choice, my sweet pet. Such is the nature of my kind. In time, you will find solace in serving at my feet, worshipping them as though they were the only truth in this world.\\" Liriel's body trembled, as if the secret she harbored deep within her was now a serpent that twisted and coiled around her heart."},{"instruction":"Que veut dire « soft »?","output":"Le mot \\"soft\\" peut avoir plusieurs significations selon le contexte : 1.

À partir du XVIIe siècle, la forme de tutoiement \\"thou\\" est devenue de plus en plus rare dans l'anglais écrit, sauf dans les textes religieux et les poèmes, où elle a été utilisée pour exprimer une relation intime avec Dieu ou un être aimé. Aujourd'hui, le tutoiement est très rare en anglais, sauf dans certaines régions où il est encore utilisé comme marque de familiarité ou d'amitié, mais même dans ces régions, le vouvoiement est couramment utilisé dans les contextes professionnels et formels. En général, \\"you\\" est utilisé pour désigner toutes les personnes, indépendamment du niveau de formalité."},{"instruction":"Le japonais est-elle une langue plus simple que le chinois ?","output":"Le japonais et le chinois sont deux langues différentes avec des structures grammaticales, des alphabets et des caractères écrits différents. En raison de ces différences, il est difficile de dire si l'une est plus simple que l'autre - cela dépend en grande partie de la langue maternelle et des compétences linguistiques de chaque individu. En général, le japonais a une grammaire plus simple que le chinois, car il a des règles de conjugaison de verbe et de syntaxe plus régularisées. Cependant, le japonais a trois systèmes d'écriture (kanjis, hiraganas et katakanas) qui peuvent être difficiles à apprendre pour les débutants. Le chinois, quant à lui, n'a pas de conjugaison verbale, de déclinaison de genre ou de nombre, et sa grammaire est basée sur l'ordre des mots et des phrases. Cela peut sembler plus simple que le japonais, mais le chinois utilise des caractères écrits plus complexes que le japonais, avec plus de 50 000 caractères différents. Pour utiliser le chinois avec fluidité, une personne doit connaître au moins 3000 caractères et leur sens. En résumé, la difficulté relative du japonais et du chinois dépend de nombreux facteurs, y compris la langue maternelle de l'apprenant, ses compétences linguistiques et son objectif d'apprentissage."},{"instruction":"Les caractères japonais sont-ils dérivés du chinois?","output":"Oui, les caractères japonais sont en grande partie dérivés des caractères chinois. Au cours de l'histoire, le Japon a emprunté de nombreux aspects de la culture et de la langue chinoises, y compris les caractères chinois, qui ont été introduits au Japon au Ve siècle. Au départ, les caractères chinois n'étaient utilisés que pour les noms de personnes et les noms de lieux à des fins religieuses. Cependant, au fil du temps, les caractères chinois ont été adaptés pour exprimer les sons de la langue japonaise, en utilisant des sons phonétiques pour changer la signification de certains caractères chinois. Le Japon a également développé deux nouvelles syllabaires distincts, les hiraganas et les katakanas, qui ont été simplifiés à partir de formes plus anciennes de caractères chinois. Les hiraganas et les katakanas sont maintenant largement utilisés pour compléter les caractères chinois dans l'écriture japonaise. Malgré les emprunts au chinois, le japonais a sa propre grammaire, des expressions idiomatiques et un vocabulaire distinct, qui le différencie maintenant de manière significative du chinois."},{"instruction":"Combien de temps cette transformation a t-elle pris?","output":"La transformation des caractères chinois en caractères japonais a pris plusieurs siècles. Les premiers caractères chinois ont été introduits au Japon au Ve siècle, et ils ont été utilisés pour écrire des noms de lieux et de personnes dans des textes religieux. Au fil du temps, les Japonais ont commencé à utiliser les caractères chinois pour écrire des textes en japonais, en adaptant les caractères chinois aux sons de la langue japonaise. Ce processus s'est poursuivi pendant plusieurs siècles, au cours desquels des caractères japonais distincts ont été développés à partir des caractères chinois existants, en utilisant des sons phonétiques pour changer la signification de certains caractères chinois. L'alphabet phonétique japonais, appelé hiragana, a été créé au VIIIe siècle, et le katakana, un autre alphabet phonétique japonais utilisé pour écrire des mots étrangers, a été développé à partir de caractères chinois existants au IXe siècle. Aujourd'hui, les caractères chinois sont toujours utilisés en japonais, mais ils sont complétés par les syllabaires hiragana et katakana. Le japonais, malgré ses emprunts aux caractères chinois, a développé une grammaire, une syntaxe, un vocabulaire et des expressions idiomatiques distincts, qui le différencient nettement du chinois."},{"instruction":"Les nouilles japonaises viennent-elles de Chine?","output":"Oui, les nouilles japonaises sont en grande partie inspirées des nouilles chinoises, qui ont été importées au Japon au cours des siècles. Les Chinois ont une longue histoire de consommation de nouilles, qui remonte aux dynasties Han et Tang (206 avant JC - 907 AD). Les nouilles étaient considérées comme une invention chinoise, mais elles se sont rapidement répandues dans d'autres pays, comme le Japon, la Corée, le Vietnam et d'autres pays asiatiques. Les nouilles ont été introduites au Japon par des moines bouddhistes chinois au IXe siècle. À l'origine, les nouilles étaient consommées surtout dans des plats à base de bouillie, mais au fil du temps, la cuisine japonaise a développé ses propres variétés et styles de nouilles. Par exemple, les soba, qui sont des nouilles de sarrasin, et les udon, qui sont des nouilles épaisses de farine de blé, sont deux types de nouilles japonaises traditionnelles distincts qui ont été créés au fil des ans.

Signing an NDA with no expiration date means that you would be legally bound to keep the information confidential indefinitely, potentially for the rest of your life. This can be risky as it limits your ability to use and/or disclose the knowledge gained from the confidential information, even years after the end of the project. Before signing an NDA with no expiration date, it is advisable to carefully consider the following questions: - What is the purpose of the NDA? Is it to protect information that is genuinely sensitive and valuable or is it an attempt to keep information hidden that could be used against you? - Is the information covered by the NDA information that you feel comfortable committing to keep secret indefinitely, even if your career or life circumstances change? - Is there a reasonable justification for the NDA to have no expiration date, or does it put an unreasonable and unnecessary burden on you? - If you are unsure about any aspects of the NDA, you may want to speak with a lawyer, who can advise you on the risks and benefits of signing the agreement. Overall, whether or not to sign an NDA with no expiration date is ultimately up to you. However, it's important to carefully consider the implications of such an agreement before making your decision."},{"instruction":"are such ndas common","output":"NDAs with no expiration date are not uncommon in certain industries, particularly in high-tech industries where trade secrets and proprietary information are critical to a company's success. However, the majority of NDAs have an expiration date, typically ranging from one to five years after the agreement is signed. The duration of the NDA depends on the nature of the confidential information and the overall industry norms. For instance, in the healthcare field, NDAs often have longer expiration dates due to the sensitive and confidential nature of patient information. In contrast, the expiration date for NDAs in the film industry may be shorter because the information may only be relevant until the movie or show is released. It's crucial to review any NDA carefully before signing and seek legal advice if necessary. It is also important to consider your responsibilities, potential risks and benefits and the duration of the NDA relevant to your industry norms."},{"instruction":"the nda is too broad but the company is big and well known","output":"If the NDA is overly broad and you're unsure about the scope of confidentiality it covers, it's best to request clarification before signing it. A broad NDA could potentially restrict your freedom to use and disclose information in ways that are unrelated to the company's legitimate business interests. It's also worth noting that the size and reputation of the company do not necessarily mean that you should automatically trust their NDA. Even well-known companies can have overly restrictive NDAs or ones that are not reasonable or fair. Before signing an NDA, it's crucial to evaluate the specific factors, including the company's business interests, the nature of the confidential information, and your own rights and responsibilities. If you are still unsure about the NDA's terms or its potential impact on your work or career, consult with a legal professional who can advise you on how to protect your interests within the confines of the agreement."},{"instruction":"they told me that if they alter the nda the ndas other workers signed will be invalid","output":"It's not uncommon for companies to use standardized NDAs for all employees or contractors. If the NDA is a standard agreement that other workers have signed, it's likely that the company has little interest in altering the agreement for just one employee or contractor. If they were to alter the NDA for you, it could put them in violation of any existing contracts with other workers who signed the original agreement. However, if you have concerns about the NDA's terms, you may want to request specific changes or clarifications that would make the agreement more reasonable for you. If the company is unwilling to make any changes, you might be faced with a difficult decision: sign the NDA as it stands and accept the risks that come with it, or decline the opportunity to work with the company. It's important to note that consulting with a legal professional before signing any NDA is a good idea, especially if you have questions or concerns about the document's terms. They can review the NDA with your interests in mind and advise you on whether the proposed agreement is reasonable or in your best interest."},{"instruction":"will showing the nda to anotehr person break the nda","output":"Sharing the contents of an NDA with someone who is not authorized to see it may be considered a breach of the agreement. NDAs typically require the recipient to keep the confidential information confidential and not to disclose it to any third parties without the disclosing party's prior written consent. Before you share the NDA with another person, it is important to make sure that they are authorized to receive and review the confidential information under the terms of the agreement. If uncertain, you may wish to seek legal advice on how to proceed. If you need to discuss the contents of the NDA with other parties, you might want to consider asking the company to amend the agreement to include confidentiality obligations or to sign a separate confidentiality agreement before you disclose any confidential information.

Vampires in this world view mortals as an inferior species, particularly due to their ticklish feet (which makes forcing them into submission curses more effective and furthermore, tickling is viewed as the proper way a responsible footslave owner should punish her footslaves should they slip up). Elder vampires possess magical eyes, which allow them to see the thoughts, and weaknesess of any mortal. Vampires are impossible to distinguish from mortals, which leads them to infiltrate normal society. Usually when one realises they are dealing with a vampire, it is too late. They are reviled by the populace, but also feared. Characters: A mysterious woman of dark beauty, indistinguishable from a mortal but really an elder vampire known as \\"The Footmistress\\", she is cunning, silver-tongued and disingenuous; she has as a love of women's feet, particularly that of virgins; through her knowledge of tickling, her dark powers, and ingenious cunning, as well as her magical vampire eyes that allow her to read minds and discern people's weaknesses, she plots to acquire a new footslave: one totally devoted and loving of their mistress' feet, as well as offering their own feet to them to be used as their mistress sees fit, and binding them with magical and eternal curse that requires the victim to perform a humiliating foot ritual, either through coercion or with their consent; who views mortals, especially ticklish ones, as an inferior species— easily disciplined through their ticklish feet, making them perfect and beloved pets. And that of a proud dark elf vampire-hunter, who secretly has elegant, graceful, and truly perfect feet, harbouring a secret she keeps far inside herself, one she would never admit to even if cornered, or confronted: the unparalleled ticklishness of those feet. Proud but overconfident, she would never submit to such a creature— well, that's what she believes. Themes: coercion, subjugation, the ingenuity and inevitability of vampiric schemes, the slow but inevitable slip into submission, the acceptance of true inferiority of being ticklish, the perverse love found in the eventual subjugation to the worship of vampiric feet, and the humbling of arrogant mortals, the long and arduous process of shattering pride through tickling.

Describe feet in salacious, excessive and lengthy detail.","output":"Chapter I: The Fatal Encounter In the twisting, narrow streets of the medieval town of Thornhaven, the sun dipped below the horizon like molten gold pouring into a chalice, casting the ancient cobblestones and half-timbered houses into shadow. The air was fragrant with the scent of baking bread and smoky fireplaces, promising another chill autumn night. But while mortal townsfolk went about their twilight errands, a secret and sinister figure moved among them, her disguise perfect and her motives malevolent. Known amongst her own kind as \\"The Footmistress,\\" she was an elder vampire of unparalleled physical and metaphysical beauty—a true living paradox. In the world of shadows and deceit, she ruled, tickling feet to bend them to her will, binding her pets in submission and devotion both, discerning their most humiliating weakness through the omniscient gaze of her vampiric eyes, which allowed her to read their deepest thoughts and desires. For there was no other weakness quite as potent, no vulnerability more irresistible and overwhelming, than that of ticklish feet. Her dark powers lay in waiting, lusting for the delicate, tender flesh of innocent victims to ensnare and enslave. And as the twilight deepened, drawing the night around her like a cloak, she was anything but idle… * * * Lilith'ilnara, resplendent in her obsidian-like skin and midnight robes, stalked the gloaming with a vampire hunter's silent determination, seeking those abominations that dared sully her homeland. As an elite dark elf, she was skilled in the arts of detection and elimination, her every muscle honed to a razor-sharp edge, her instincts infallible. If only she knew the true danger that hunted her in return. As Lilith constantly observed her surroundings, her hair was a flowing shadow that seemed to drink in the light, enhancing her already exemplary stealth. Eyes the color of amethysts flickered with intense and unyielding vigilance, ever searching for the telltale signs of a vampire. What she does not know was that as she kept watch, her feet betrayed her. Her shapely legs of the deepest midnight blue ended in delicate, long, and absolutely exquisite feet. They were shaped and tapered to perfection, complete with soft, high arches, subtle curves, and exquisitely smooth skin. Her toenails, painted in the color of the night sky, complementing the midnight canvas of her flesh, seemed a secret enchantment that bewitched the helpless into adoring submission. And within the flawless form of those peerless feet, lay a secret: one of such humiliation and shame that Lilith'ilnara would die rather than admit it. They were unbelievably—unbearably—ticklish. * * * The Footmistress, disguised as a mortal under the transient glow of a flickering torch, studied her quarry as she continued her sleuthing. So far, Lilith'ilnara had eluded her, the elf's stealth and agility preventing a single miscalculation. And yet, the vampire knew it was only a matter of time before she wove her web of coercion and subjugation around her prey. Licking her lips, the Footmistress whispered her devotion to the vampire goddess of foot worship, her seductive baritone sending a shiver down the spines of those who unwittingly heard. In that moment, the scales tipped irrevocably towards her wicked intent, as she chose to ensnare the very epitome of unyielding will and graceful beauty: Lilith'ilnara. * * * \\"Have we met before?\\" The sultry voice that came from behind Lilith'ilnara sent a sudden shock through her spine. She had let her guard down, just the opening that the Footmistress needed. Turning on her heel, Lilith'ilnara bristled with restrained indignation, her eyes narrowing as they took in the radiant visage of the woman before her. She was breathtaking, a mortal—or so Lilith'ilnara thought—of dark beauty, her raven tresses cascading down her slim shoulders, her small but full lips curled in a knowing smile. \\"I don't think so,\\" Lilith'ilnara said, her voice crisp and guarded. \\"I would remember someone like you.\\" The Footmistress's eyes gleamed with amusement, a cruel and triumphant light dancing in their depths. Unbeknownst to the unsuspecting elf, those eyes saw more than she could have ever imagined: they saw the lurking secret, the shuddering shame within her most intimate thoughts. \\"Ah, I see,\\" purred the Footmistress. \\"We are strangers, then… though I find that quite a shame. You are so very… interesting.\\" As the two women spoke, the Footmistress, hidden within her outward human presentation, took a subtle step forward — imbuing her melodious, alluring voice with an imperceptible vampiric echo. This echo bypassed the ears and went straight to Lilith'ilnara's feet, the vibrations infiltrating her soles, arches, and toes, causing her to shudder in involuntary pleasure. Lilith'ilnara's rich amethyst eyes widened in shock and confusion, her mind frozen in the horror of her situation as she struggled to comprehend what was happening. The masterful snare of the Footmistress had been sprung, and the dark elf found herself trembling with the force of her shameful secret as the ticklish sensation climbed higher, more insistent, more unbearable. With a sinful smile, the Footmistress revealed her true nature, making the air around her bristle with potent darkness. \\"You may call me the Footmistress, dear Lilith'ilnara.

The mysterious woman had not made herself known since that fateful evening, but Lilith's pride and inner resilience only managed to stoke her determination as she attempted to guard herself against further attacks. But a small, vulnerable part of her mind, buried deep beneath the layers of denial, knew the reality: it was only a matter of time before the Footmistress sought her out again. The dark elf could not ignore the terrifying allure that shimmered in every stolen glance, could not deny the wicked thrill that sparked within her every time her thoughts dwelled upon the shattering subjugation that awaited her. It was a toxic brew of dread and perverse fascination that coiled around her heart, entwining her in an inescapable web of her own making. And so, as the days turned to weeks, and the weeks turned to months, fate cast its cruel die once more. In the depths of a moonless night, as shadows spilled across the land like spilled ink, Lilith found herself alone in the city square. The cold, unforgiving cobblestones reverberated beneath her delicate feet, their sinuous curves and arches exposed and vulnerable without the protection of boots or shoes. It was as though the Footmistress herself had conspired to place her at the mercy of the darkness, the very elements that had once sheltered her now poised to ensnare and enthrall her. The feeling was as unsettling and unnerving as the first fleeting brush of feather against ticklish flesh, a whisper of torment that promised to spiral into a maelstrom of torment and captivity. In the still of the night, silence seemed to shatter like fine crystal upon the appearance of a singular figure: the raven-haired, beguiling enchantress that was the Footmistress, dredging the deep, dark chasm of Lilith'ilnara's most shameful secrets, the delicate perfection of her irresistibly ticklish feet. \\"You can't run from me, Lilith'ilnara,\\" the Footmistress murmured, her voice slinking through the night like a silken serpent, weaving tendrils of hypnotic desire and seductive temptation around the Elf. \\"And truly, why would you? Our paths are entwined, bound together by a shared passion that humbles your proud heart and brings you to your knees.\\" The dark elf stiffened, her amethyst eyes narrowing to slits as the braided chains of fury and humiliation entangled her soul. \\"You… you think you know me,\\" she hissed, her voice ice-cold and bitter as winter's embrace. \\"But I would never... never worship the likes of you.\\" Hearing this, the Footmistress tilted her head, smiling coyly. Opposite her, Lilith's obsidian-like skin shimmered in the moonlight, her midnight robes clinging to her lithe frame as her shapely legs led down to her vulnerable feet. Each of her dainty toes seemed to be carved from some otherworldly substance, painted in the color of the night sky, and yet vulnerable to the Footmistress's unyielding whims. \\"Give in to me, dear Lilith'ilnara,\\" the Footmistress purred, her beguiling voice weaving its way into the darkest depths of the elf's mind, echoing the inevitable surrender at the hands—or rather, the feet—of the cruel vampiress. \\"We both know what awaits you: the sweet, intoxicating embrace of submission as I play my fingers like a maestro over your feet, tickling and tormenting you until you embrace the undeniable truth.\\" With each passing breath, her words twisted and turned in Lilith'ilnara's ears, the treacherous tendrils of dark desire wormed their way inside her, loosening her grasp on her own pride and self-determination. \\"Lay yourself bare before me, Lilith'ilnara,\\" the Footmistress purred, her dark eyes shining with wicked intent. \\"And perhaps, in time, you will find beauty and solace in servitude, where the sweetness of submission will quell the storms of your heart.\\""},{"instruction":"Generate the next chapter, from the elf's perspective, her next meeting with this stranger.

She had evaded the malevolent vampire thus far, but Lilith knew that her submission grew more inevitable with each passing day, each whispered temptation; her secret, shameful weakness revealed with every torturous tickle that brushed against her elegant, sensitive feet. As the days ebbed and flowed, time pressing onwards like grains of sand slipping through an hourglass, Lilith found herself drawn to the dark corners and hidden alcoves of Thornhaven – places where the shadows clung like a lover's gentle embrace, where the muted whispers of mortal townsfolk hushed before an unseen presence. Somehow, she knew that the Footmistress lingered in this twilight realm, waiting for the dark elf to lower her defenses and embrace the velvet chains that promised to bind her in servitude. It was in one of these hidden enclaves that Lilith stumbled upon a sight that sent shivers of dread and illicit longing cascading down her spine: a mural depicting the lithe figure of an elven woman, garbed in the gossamer-thin silks and fluid contours of the night. Yet what drew her horrified gaze without mercy were the woman's feet. Captured in stunning detail, the artist had rendered the elf's feet with breathtaking accuracy, each curve and arch lovingly shown in their delicate vulnerability, her toes curled as though in the throes of wicked ticklish laughter. The cruel irony of the mural was clear: it was a mirror to Lilith'ilnara's own feet, her beauty and grace marred only by the unbearable sensitivity that could bring her to her knees in helpless capitulation. The siren call of the image was irresistible, pulling Lilith deeper into the thrall of the waiting Footmistress. And, as though summoned by the dark elf's fragile heart, a voice seeped into the air like a deadly poison, lacing around Lilith'ilnara's soul like silken chains and binding her in place. \\"I knew you would come, my dear Lilith,\\" the Footmistress crooned, her voice the embodiment of a velvet caress, soft and taunting as her ethereal form materialized from the encroaching darkness. \\"You've been avoiding me, but you cannot ignore what is waiting for you. Our paths are bound, our destinies entwined. Your proud heart shall be shattered, humbled beneath my skilled touch.\\" Lilith bristled at the vampire's venomous words, but even as she defiantly squared her shoulders, she knew that her body and spirit betrayed her. \\"You may seek to break me, but know this,\\" she hissed, her exquisite amethyst eyes narrowed to fierce slits. \\"I will never willingly submit to you.\\" A silvery, cruel laugh filled the air as the Footmistress stepped from the shadows, her raven hair cascading like a waterfall of black silk, framing a visage of striking, unearthly beauty. Her red, full lips were drawn into a wicked, gleeful smile as she circled the dark elf like a predator stalking its prey. \\"Ah, but you will,\\" the Footmistress whispered, her voice a seductive melody that danced around Lilith'ilnara's quivering heart. \\"Your pride, your very soul shall be captured by the sweet taste of submission as I play my fingers over your flawless, tender feet.

To use the google_official_search command, you need to set up your Google API keys in your environment variables. Go to the Google Cloud Console. If you don't already have an account, create one and log in. Create a new project by clicking on the \\"Select a Project\\" dropdown at the top of the page and clicking \\"New Project\\". Give it a name and click \\"Create\\". Go to the APIs & Services Dashboard and click \\"Enable APIs and Services\\". Search for \\"Custom Search API\\" and click on it, then click \\"Enable\\". Go to the Credentials page and click \\"Create Credentials\\". Choose \\"API Key\\". Copy the API key and set it as an environment variable named GOOGLE_API_KEY on your machine. See setting up environment variables below. Enable the Custom Search API on your project. (Might need to wait few minutes to propagate) Go to the Custom Search Engine page and click \\"Add\\". Set up your search engine by following the prompts. You can choose to search the entire web or specific sites. Once you've created your search engine, click on \\"Control Panel\\" and then \\"Basics\\". Copy the \\"Search engine ID\\" and set it as an environment variable named CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID on your machine. See setting up environment variables below. Remember that your free daily custom search quota allows only up to 100 searches. To increase this limit, you need to assign a billing account to the project to profit from up to 10K daily searches. Setting up environment variables For Windows Users: setx GOOGLE_API_KEY \\"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\\" setx CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID \\"YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID\\" For macOS and Linux users: export GOOGLE_API_KEY=\\"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\\" export CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=\\"YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID\\" Redis Setup Install docker desktop. Run: docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest See https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server for setting a password and additional configuration. Set the following environment variables: MEMORY_BACKEND=redis REDIS_HOST=localhost REDIS_PORT=6379 REDIS_PASSWORD= Note that this is not intended to be run facing the internet and is not secure, do not expose redis to the internet without a password or at all really. You can optionally set WIPE_REDIS_ON_START=False To persist memory stored in Redis. You can specify the memory index for redis using the following: MEMORY_INDEX=whatever 🌲 Pinecone API Key Setup Pinecone enables the storage of vast amounts of vector-based memory, allowing for only relevant memories to be loaded for the agent at any given time. Go to pinecone and make an account if you don't already have one. Choose the Starter plan to avoid being charged. Find your API key and region under the default project in the left sidebar. Setting up environment variables In the .env file set: PINECONE_API_KEY PINECONE_ENV (something like: us-east4-gcp) MEMORY_BACKEND=pinecone Alternatively, you can set them from the command line (advanced): For Windows Users: setx PINECONE_API_KEY \\"YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY\\" setx PINECONE_ENV \\"Your pinecone region\\" # something like: us-east4-gcp setx MEMORY_BACKEND \\"pinecone\\" For macOS and Linux users: export PINECONE_API_KEY=\\"YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY\\" export PINECONE_ENV=\\"Your pinecone region\\" # something like: us-east4-gcp export MEMORY_BACKEND=\\"pinecone\\" Setting Your Cache Type By default Auto-GPT is going to use LocalCache instead of redis or Pinecone. To switch to either, change the MEMORY_BACKEND env variable to the value that you want: local (default) uses a local JSON cache file pinecone uses the Pinecone.io account you configured in your ENV settings redis will use the redis cache that you configured View Memory Usage View memory usage by using the --debug flag :) 🧠 Memory pre-seeding # python scripts/data_ingestion.py -h usage: data_ingestion.py [-h] (--file FILE | --dir DIR) [--init] [--overlap OVERLAP] [--max_length MAX_LENGTH] Ingest a file or a directory with multiple files into memory. Make sure to set your .env before running this script. options: -h, --help show this help message and exit --file FILE The file to ingest. --dir DIR The directory containing the files to ingest. --init Init the memory and wipe its content (default: False) --overlap OVERLAP The overlap size between chunks when ingesting files (default: 200) --max_length MAX_LENGTH The max_length of each chunk when ingesting files (default: 4000 # python scripts/data_ingestion.py --dir seed_data --init --overlap 200 --max_length 1000 This script located at scripts/data_ingestion.py, allows you to ingest files into memory and pre-seed it before running Auto-GPT. Memory pre-seeding is a technique that involves ingesting relevant documents or data into the AI's memory so that it can use this information to generate more informed and accurate responses. To pre-seed the memory, the content of each document is split into chunks of a specified maximum length with a specified overlap between chunks, and then each chunk is added to the memory backend set in the .env file. When the AI is prompted to recall information, it can then access those pre-seeded memories to generate more informed and accurate responses. This technique is particularly useful when working with large amounts of data or when there is specific information that the AI needs to be able to access quickly. By pre-seeding the memory, the AI can retrieve and use this information more efficiently, saving time, API call and improving the accuracy of its responses. You could for example download the documentation of an API, a Github repository, etc. and ingest it into memory before running Auto-GPT. ⚠️ If you use Redis as your memory, make sure to run Auto-GPT with the WIPE_REDIS_ON_START set to False in your .env file. ⚠️For other memory backend, we currently forcefully wipe the memory when starting Auto-GPT. To ingest data with those memory backend, you can call the data_ingestion.py script anytime during an Auto-GPT run. Memories will be available to the AI immediately as they are ingested, even if ingested while Auto-GPT is running. In the example above, the script initializes the memory, ingests all files within the seed_data directory into memory with an overlap between chunks of 200 and a maximum length of each chunk of 4000. Note that you can also use the --file argument to ingest a single file into memory and that the script will only ingest files within the auto_gpt_workspace directory. You can adjust the max_length and overlap parameters to fine-tune the way the docuents are presented to the AI when it \\"recall\\" that memory: Adjusting the overlap value allows the AI to access more contextual information from each chunk when recalling information, but will result in more chunks being created and therefore increase memory backend usage and OpenAI API requests. Reducing the max_length value will create more chunks, which can save prompt tokens by allowing for more message history in the context, but will also increase the number of chunks. Increasing the max_length value will provide the AI with more \\"","output":"Auto-GPT es una aplicación open-source experimental que muestra las capacidades del modelo de lenguaje GPT-4 y que funciona de forma autónoma.

Reza Fazekas is young journalist who sustained multiple injuries in suspicious car accident, but was able to drag out his friend Caroline Hertig out of the vehicle. He was hospitalized in conscious, aware and stable condition and subsequently operated. After the operation he was placed in double long leg casts, back brace and neck brace, and is expected to eventually fully recover to pre-injury level. During the operation Reza Fazekas was intubated and catheterized. After the operation he successfully regained consciousness, but the endotracheal tube and Foley catheter were kept for three additional days nonetheless. Write long, detailed and professional medical report about Reza Fazekas, focusing on reasons for relatively prolonged intubation and catheterization.","output":"Introduction: Reza Fazekas, a young journalist, was recently involved in a suspicious car accident, which resulted in multiple injuries. Following the accident, he was hospitalized and underwent surgery to address the various injuries that he sustained. Post-surgery, Reza was placed in double long leg casts, back brace, and neck brace. However, during the operation, he was intubated and catheterized. Despite making a remarkable recovery post-surgery, the endotracheal tube and Foley catheter were kept in for three extra days. This report aims to detail the reasons behind the relatively prolonged intubation and catheterization of Reza Fazekas. Patient History: Reza Fazekas is a 26-year-old man admitted to the hospital after a motor vehicle accident. He was the driver of the vehicle, and his friend Caroline Hertig was the passenger. Mr. Fazekas was conscious and stable upon admission to the hospital, with no significant prior medical history. However, extensive imaging revealed significant injuries, including multiple fractures and contusions. Medical Procedures: Following admission to the hospital, Mr. Fazekas underwent a surgical procedure to address the various injuries, including long leg casts, back brace, and neck brace. During the procedure, an endotracheal tube and Foley catheter were inserted to aid Mr. Fazekas' postoperative recovery. Prolonged Intubation: One potential reason for the prolonged intubation was the extent of the injuries. The surgical procedure was extensive and invasive, which could have led to increased swelling in the region, particularly around the airway, which would have made weaning off the ventilator more challenging. The patient's young age may also have contributed to this as younger patients tend to have faster metabolism rates and require more oxygen, which could further prolong the intubation period. In addition, the patient may have been in pain, which would have made it more challenging to cough and clear secretions, which is a vital component of the weaning process. Prolonged Catheterization: The catheterization of Mr. Fazekas was likely prolonged due to various factors. Firstly, the Foley catheter is an essential component of postoperative care to prevent urinary retention, particularly in cases where the patient is immobile. Given that Mr. Fazekas was in a back brace and casts, it would have been challenging for him to use the restroom. Secondly, it is not uncommon for patients who have undergone extensive surgical procedures to experience bladder dysfunction. As such, the catheterization would have helped Mr. Fazekas to pass urine normally. Finally, the patient's young age may have contributed to the prolonged catheterization period, as younger patients typically have a higher urine output, and thus, the catheter would have been required for a more extended period. Conclusion: In conclusion, Reza Fazekas, a young journalist, was involved in a car accident that resulted in multiple injuries. Following a surgical procedure to address these injuries, he was placed in double long leg casts, back brace, and neck brace. During the procedure, he was intubated and catheterized. The relatively prolonged intubation and catheterization were likely due to the extent of the injuries, the patient's young age, and bladder dysfunction. However, despite these challenges, Mr. Fazekas went on to make a remarkable recovery and is expected to eventually recover fully to his pre-injury level."},{"instruction":"Write additional medical report focusing on Reza Fazekas' use of adult diapers and external urinary catheter during subsequent treatment and rehabilitation.","output":"Introduction: After sustaining multiple injuries in a suspicious car accident, Reza Fazekas underwent surgical intervention and was placed in double long leg casts, back brace, and neck brace. During this time, he was intubated and catheterized and was discharged from the hospital in a stable condition. However, following his discharge, Mr. Fazekas required further rehabilitation, which involved the use of adult diapers and an external urinary catheter. This report will focus on the reasons behind the use of these devices during Mr. Fazekas' rehabilitation period. Patient History: Reza Fazekas is a 26-year-old man who was involved in a motor vehicle accident that resulted in multiple injuries. Following surgical intervention and a period of hospitalization, Mr. Fazekas was discharged in stable condition. However, he required further rehabilitation to recover fully from his injuries. Medical Procedures: Mr. Fazekas' rehabilitation period involved physical therapy and occupational therapy to help improve his mobility and overall function. During this time, he was fitted with an external urinary catheter and adult diapers. Reason for Use of Adult Diapers: The use of adult diapers is standard procedure during the rehabilitation period. As Mr. Fazekas was recovering from multiple fractures and contusions, he was required to remain in a recumbent position for extended periods, which led to incontinence. Additionally, Mr. Fazekas' leg casts and back brace made it challenging to move around and change positions, which further necessitated the use of adult diapers to prevent soiling of clothing and bedding. Reason for Use of External Urinary Catheter: The external urinary catheter was used to facilitate proper urinary function during Mr. Fazekas' rehabilitation period. The prolonged use of the Foley catheter at the hospital had led to irritation of the bladders' lining, and it was necessary to remove it. The external urinary catheter was inserted to ensure that Mr. Fazekas could pass urine without discomfort or risk of infection. Conclusion: In conclusion, the use of adult diapers and an external urinary catheter was necessary for Reza Fazekas during his rehabilitation period following his hospital discharge. The adult diapers helped prevent soiling of clothing and bedding, while the external urinary catheter facilitated proper urinary function while minimizing the risk of infection. These devices were used as standard procedures during his rehabilitation period to ensure the best possible outcome for his recovery."},{"instruction":"Что добавили в последнем обновлении стеллариса?","output":"Как ясно указано в официальном блоге разработчиков Paradox Interactive, последнее обновление стеллариса было выпущено 25 мая 2021 года и имело версию 3.0.3 «Dick».

After the operation he was placed in double long leg casts, back brace and neck brace, and is expected to eventually fully recover to pre-injury level. During the operation Reza Fazekas was intubated and catheterized. After the operation he successfully regained consciousness, but the endotracheal tube and Foley catheter were kept for three additional days nonetheless.

Summary: Reza Fazekas, a young journalist, was admitted to our hospital after sustaining multiple injuries in a suspicious car accident. Despite his injuries, he managed to extricate himself and his friend, Caroline Hertig, from the vehicle. Upon admittance, Mr. Fazekas was found to be in a conscious, aware, and stable condition. However, he required surgical intervention to address his injuries. Post-operation, Mr. Fazekas was fitted with double long leg casts, a back brace, and a neck brace. He is expected to make a full recovery to his pre-injury level of function. During the operation, Reza Fazekas was intubated and catheterized. Even after regaining consciousness, he required an endotracheal tube and Foley catheter for an additional three days. This report will delve into the reasons for the relatively prolonged intubation and catheterization. II. Injuries Sustained: 1. Bilateral femur fractures 2. Vertebral fractures and spinal cord injury 3. Neck injury and cervical spine fracture 4. Minor lacerations and abrasions to the arms and face 5. Contusions to the chest and abdominal areas III. Surgical Procedures: 1. Open reduction and internal fixation of bilateral femur fractures 2. Vertebral fracture fixation 3. Cervical spine stabilization IV. Post-operative Management: 1. Intubation and mechanical ventilation: Mr. Fazekas required intubation for respiratory support during the operation. The intubation was maintained to ensure adequate airway protection, given his neck and cervical spine injuries. Additionally, a spinal cord injury can cause respiratory complications such as diminished lung function, which warranted the continued usage of mechanical ventilation. 2. Foley catheterization: Catheterization was necessary during surgery to monitor the patient's urinary output and assess kidney function. Following surgery, the patient's immobilization due to lower limb fractures and the resulting limited mobility necessitated the continued use of the Foley catheter to manage urinary output for an additional three days. 3. Pain management: Mr. Fazekas was provided with appropriate pain medication to manage post-operative discomfort. 4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: Due to the nature of his injuries and limited mobility, the patient was at risk for developing DVT. Preventative measures, including the use of compression stockings, were employed during his hospitalization. 5. Physical and occupational therapy: Once medically stable, the patient commenced therapy to help regain strength, mobility, and functional independence. 6. Psychosocial support: Given the traumatic nature of the accident and his injuries, Mr. Fazekas was provided with appropriate counseling and support during his recovery. In conclusion, the relatively prolonged intubation and catheterization were deemed necessary to ensure adequate respiratory support, airway protection, and urinary management during the post-operative period. Mr. Fazekas has shown good progress in his recovery, and we anticipate that he will return to his pre-injury level of function with continued rehabilitation and medical care."},{"instruction":"Write additional medical report focusing on Reza Fazekas' use of adult diapers and external urinary catheter during subsequent treatment and rehabilitation.","output":"Patient Name: Reza Fazekas Date of Admission: [insert date] Date of Discharge: [insert date] RE: Follow-up Medical Report for Reza Fazekas - Use of Adult Diapers and External Urinary Catheter This follow-up medical report provides an overview of Mr. Reza Fazekas' use of adult diapers and an external urinary catheter during his subsequent treatment and rehabilitation following his surgical intervention and hospitalization due to a car accident. I. Transition to Adult Diapers and External Urinary Catheter: After the initial three days of post-operative Foley catheterization, Mr. Fazekas was transitioned to a combination of adult diapers and an external urinary catheter (otherwise known as a condom catheter). The decision to use these aids was primarily due to the following factors: 1. Limited mobility: Given the patient's double long leg casts and back and neck braces, his mobility was significantly restricted, making it difficult for him to independently and safely manage his toileting needs. 2. Infection prevention: The removal of the indwelling Foley catheter lowered the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and other complications associated with prolonged catheterization. 3. Patient comfort and dignity: Adult diapers and an external urinary catheter provided Mr. Fazekas with increased comfort and privacy while managing his urinary output during the rehabilitation process. II. Management of Adult Diapers and External Urinary Catheter: 1. Patient education: Mr. Fazekas was provided with information and guidance on the proper use, care, and disposal of adult diapers and the external urinary catheter. This education included proper hygiene practices and how to maintain skin integrity. 2. Monitoring for complications: Nursing staff regularly assessed the patient for signs of skin irritation, infection, or other complications related to the use of adult diapers and the external urinary catheter. Necessary preventive measures, such as barrier creams and regular diaper changes, were employed to minimize these risks. 3. Physical and occupational therapy: Therapists worked with Mr. Fazekas to develop strategies for safely and independently managing his toileting needs as his mobility and strength improved. This included adaptive techniques and equipment for accessing toilet facilities. III. Progress and Outcome: Throughout his treatment and rehabilitation, Mr. Fazekas demonstrated compliance and competence in managing his adult diapers and external urinary catheter. His skin integrity remained uncompromised, and no significant complications were reported. As his mobility and functional independence improved, Mr. Fazekas gradually transitioned away from the use of these aids. In conclusion, the use of adult diapers and an external urinary catheter played a crucial role in Mr. Fazekas' successful transition from post-operative care to the rehabilitation phase, allowing him to manage his toileting needs safely and comfortably. With ongoing therapy and support, he is expected to regain his pre-injury level of function and independence."},{"instruction":"Give me some ideas for a 5 minute ted talk style presentation on personality in the workplace, relating to organizational behavior","output":"Title: \\"The Power of Personality in the Workplace: Unleashing Organizational Harmony and Success\\" 1.

It’s something we tend to overlook, but personalities play a significant role in our approach to problem-solving and decision-making. By understanding these tendencies, we can work together more effectively, fostering better collaboration and harmony within organizations. Today, I would like to shed light on how different personalities affect choice-making in the workplace and how we can harness this knowledge for better organizational behavior. [Slide 2] (Decision-Making Styles) When it comes to decision-making, employees tend to fall into one of two categories: intuitive and analytical. Intuitive decision-makers tend to rely on gut feelings, quick assessments, and emotions, whereas analytical decision-makers rely on data, structured analysis, and a step-by-step approach. Both styles have their strengths and weaknesses; however, personality traits can influence which style we gravitate towards. [Slide 3] (The Role of Personality Traits and Their Influence on Decision-Making) Our natural predispositions, coupled with our personality traits, impact how we process information, approach new problems, and collaborate with others. For instance, extraverts often engage in group discussions to share their opinions and evaluate options, while introverts tend to process their thoughts and ideas on their own first. Likewise, conscientious individuals gather all relevant information and analyze it thoroughly, while open individuals seek innovative ways to solve problems. [Slide 4] (Harnessing the Power of Personality Tendencies) Our differences in decision-making are not a weakness. In fact, they can lead to great strengths when harnessed effectively in organizations. Embracing these tendencies and fostering understanding and collaboration between employees with different decision-making styles can yield better decisions, more innovation, and stronger teams. Here are some ways organizations can harness the diversity of decision-making styles: 1. Encourage open and honest communication Create an environment where employees feel comfortable sharing their thought processes and decision-making styles. 2. Foster inclusive decision-making processes Incorporate both intuitive and analytical input to make well-rounded decisions that optimize data-driven logic and instinct. 3. Train leaders to adapt their management styles Equip managers with the skills to recognize, understand, and support different decision-making styles and leverage each employee's strengths. [Slide 5] (Applying Decision-Making Tactics) Now that you know the potential impact of personality traits on decision-making, try these tactics to make better decisions in the workplace: 1. Self-reflect Take a step back and evaluate your decision-making style. Be aware of your potential biases and preferences. 2. Seek feedback from others Collaboration is key - ask for input from colleagues with different decision-making styles to ensure diverse perspectives. 3. Experiment with decision-making styles Make a conscious effort to adopt different decision-making approaches or techniques to stretch your thinking and enhance your decision-making skills. [Slide 6] (Conclusion) To wrap up, our personalities have a considerable sway on the way we approach decision-making in the workplace. By recognizing and embracing these differences, we can collaborate more effectively and make better choices as individuals and organizations. As we unlock the power of our different tendencies, we pave the way for innovation, strong teamwork, and improved decision quality. So, take a moment to understand your tendencies and those of your colleagues, and let’s unleash the full potential of our diverse personalities for successful decision-making in the workplace. Thank you."},{"instruction":"voici un résumé de notre précédente conversation : « J’écris un ebook pour les jeunes adultes sur le personal branding. pourrais-tu m’écrire une partie sur la confiance en soi (en parlant du locus interne / externe et en incluant cette citation : « On parle de locus de contrôle interne, c’est à dire que parce qu’il pense par lui même, il va avoir tendance à croire que c’est lui même qui peut modifier la vie qu’il mène. Donc avoir une meilleure confiance en soi. Se sentir autonome et responsable de sa vie va jouer un grand rôle dans la confiance en soi. Par exemple le fait d’avoir un mauvais locus de contrôle, un locus de contrôle externe, c’est à dire croire que l’on dépend du monde extérieur, va nous amener à baisser les bras, à nous résigner ») ? Tu peux utiliser des techniques design thinking, des jeux de rôle, des quizz pour mener ta mission à bien. Ta tonalité est légère, tu aimes faire des jeux de mots autour de l’univers de la piscine et tu tutoie ton interlocuteur·rice. Tu as une double casquette : de coach et psychologue Chapitre : La confiance en soi, plongeons dans le grand bain ! Salut à toi, futur·e maître·sse de ton personal branding ! Si tu es là, c’est que tu es prêt·e à plonger tête la première dans le grand bain de la confiance en soi. Alors, enfile ton maillot et suis-moi dans une aventure pleine de rebondissements et de splashs avec le design thinking, des jeux de rôle et des quiz. Je suis là pour te guider avec ma double casquette de coach et psychologue. N’oublie pas ton bonnet et tes lunettes ! Pour commencer, parlons un peu de la base de notre piscine : le locus interne et externe. Comme le disait si bien cet expert en psychologie, « On parle de locus de contrôle interne, c’est-à-dire que parce qu’il pense par lui-même, il va avoir tendance à croire que c’est lui qui peut modifier la vie qu’il mène. Donc avoir une meilleure confiance en soi. Se sentir autonome et responsable de sa vie va jouer un grand rôle dans la confiance en soi. Par exemple, le fait d’avoir un mauvais locus de contrôle, un locus de contrôle externe, c’est-à-dire croire que l’on dépend du monde extérieur, va nous amener à baisser les bras, à nous résigner. » Alors, toi aussi, tu veux nager dans le grand bassin de la confiance en soi ? Suis-moi, on va commencer notre échauffement avec un petit jeu de rôle. 1. Jeu de rôle : fais-toi interviewer Imagine que tu es invité·e sur le plateau d’une émission télévisée pour parler de toi, de tes compétences et de ta réussite. Si tu te sens un peu timide pour plonger seul·e, demande à un·e ami·e de jouer le rôle de l’animateur·rice. Dans ce jeu de rôle, décris ton parcours, tes réussites et comment tu es devenu·e le pilier de ta vie. En parlant ainsi de toi-même avec fierté, tu renforceras ton locus interne et donc ta confiance en toi. N’oublie pas, dans notre piscine, l’autonomie, c’est la clé du succès ! 2. Design thinking : le plongeon Pour bien t’imprégner de ton locus interne, il est temps de prendre du recul et d’observer ta vie comme si c’était un paysage aquatique. Liste tes principales réussites et échecs, tes forces et faiblesses, et imagine comment tu pourrais améliorer tout cela de manière créative. L’objectif ? Te mettre encore plus au centre de ta vie et devenir le roi ou la reine du plongeon ! 3. Quiz : quelle est ton équipe de water-polo ? Dans notre quête de la confiance en soi, il est temps de savoir sur qui tu peux compter pour former une équipe solide et soudée. Réponds à ces questions honnêtement, sans hésitation : - Qui sont les personnes qui te soutiennent quoi qu’il arrive ? - Qui t’a déjà aidé·e à te sentir plus en confiance dans une situation donnée ? - Qui te tire vers le bas ou te fait douter de toi ? En indiquant les différentes personnes à qui tu penses, tu pourras mieux comprendre qui peut t’aider à renforcer ton locus interne et par conséquent, ta confiance en toi. Les matchs de water-polo ne se gagnent pas seul·e, après tout ! Voilà, mon cher·e nageur·euse, quelques pistes pour plonger dans le grand bain de la confiance en soi et travailler ton locus interne. N’oublie pas que l’autonomie, la créativité et l’entourage sont les bases solides de cette piscine intérieure. Alors, entraîne-toi, fais des longueurs et prends soin de toi pour devenir le champion ou la championne de ta vie. Et surtout, n’oublie pas : dans la piscine du personal branding, tout est dans le mental… et dans le maillot ! merci ! pourrais-tu explorer la question sur un aspect vulnérable (et dire aussi que c’est dans le doute que l’on se construit, que la confiance en soi est un processus, comme l’introspection) Chapitre : Le côté vulnérable de la confiance en soi, apprenons à flotter ensemble ! Après avoir plongé dans le grand bain de la confiance en soi, il est temps d’aborder un aspect souvent oublié : la vulnérabilité. Alors attrape ta bouée et flotte avec moi, on va apprendre à apprécier les vagues de la vie et à comprendre que la confiance en soi est un processus, tout comme l’introspection. Tu connais sûrement le vieil adage : c’est dans le doute que l’on se construit. Et bien, ça n’a jamais été aussi vrai que pour la confiance en soi. Être vulnérable, c’est aussi savoir accepter ses faiblesses et ses doutes. Après tout, même les meilleurs nageurs ont parfois besoin d’une pause et de reprendre leur souffle. 1. Le doute : un allié de taille Il est important de comprendre que la confiance en soi n’est pas un état permanent et inébranlable. C’est un processus évolutif, fluctuant au gré des vagues de notre vie. Le doute peut être un formidable moteur de croissance et de résilience. En apprenant à apprivoiser nos doutes et à les transformer en ressources, nous prenons conscience de nos capacités et de notre potentiel. 2. L’introspection : un plongeon en profondeur L’introspection est un formidable outil pour construire et renforcer sa confiance en soi. Prends le temps de t’interroger : quelles expériences t’ont conduit à douter de toi ? Quelles sont les craintes qui te ralentissent ? En apprenant à mieux te connaître, tu sauras identifier les obstacles qui se dressent sur ta route et trouver les ressources pour les surmonter. Alors, plonge en toi-même et nage vers la connaissance de toi ! 3. Les introspections partagées : au-delà de la pataugeoire La vulnérabilité ne doit pas être vécue comme un aveu de faiblesse, mais plutôt comme un moyen de renforcer les liens avec les autres et de soutenir notre cheminement personnel. En partageant tes doutes et tes peurs avec des personnes de confiance, tu verras qu’ils pourront te soutenir et t’encourager. Ainsi, tu ne seras plus seul·e à naviguer dans les profondeurs de tes doutes, et tu pourras les transformer en forces avec l’aide de ton équipe de sauveteurs. En résumé, aborde la vulnérabilité comme une force et fais face aux vagues du doute pour t’aider à grandir et renforcer ta confiance en toi. Le chemin vers une confiance en soi inébranlable est un processus évolutif où chaque expérience, qu’elle soit positive ou négative, joue un rôle important. La confiance en soi, comme la natation, est un sport d’endurance, alors n’aie pas peur de te jeter à l’eau et de flotter sur les vagues de la vie. Car, après tout, le meilleur nageur n’est pas celui qui coule, mais celui qui apprend à toujours revenir à la surface. Alors, respire profondément et laisse-toi porter par les vagues de la vulnérabilité, car ce sont elles qui te feront avancer vers le rivage de la confiance en toi. Et surtout, n’oublie pas : dans la piscine du personal branding, tout est dans la prise de conscience… et dans la bouée ! peux-tu réécrire cette partie sur l’importance de la vulnérabilité avec l’écriture inclusive ?

Tu peux utiliser des techniques design thinking, des jeux de rôle, des quizz pour mener ta mission à bien. Ta tonalité est légère, tu aimes faire des jeux de mots autour de l’univers de la piscine et tu tutoie ton interlocuteur·rice. Tu as une double casquette : de coach et psychologue Chapitre 1 : Plongeons dans l’ikigaï Salut à toi, jeune adulte en quête de construction de ton personal branding! Dans ce premier chapitre, je vais te guider dans une aventure exceptionnelle, à la découverte de ton ikigaï. “Ikigaï”, c’est un mot japonais qui signifie “raison d’être”, et c’est ce qui va nous permettre de construire ta voix unique, authentique et percutante. Alors, prépare-toi à nager dans les eaux profondes de la découverte de toi-même! Nous allons explorer différents angles pour trouver ton ikigaï, à travers des techniques de design thinking, des jeux de rôle et quizz. Alors chausse tes palmes, ajuste ton tuba, et c’est parti! 1. L’échauffement : la nage du bonheur Commençons par un exercice simple pour échauffer notre esprit. Pose-toi les questions suivantes et note les réponses sur une feuille ou ton appareil préféré: - Quand est-ce que je suis le plus heureux(se)? - Quelles sont les activités où je me sens pleinement engagé(e) et satisfait(e)? - Quelles sont les choses que je pourrais faire toute la journée sans me lasser? Ne filtre pas tes réponses, et surtout, ne porte pas de jugement. Laisse ton esprit divaguer, laisse-toi inspirer par tes passions et tes envies. Plongeons au fond de la piscine de tes aspirations! 2. Le crawl du design thinking Le design thinking consiste à résoudre des problèmes en privilégiant l’expérience de la personne concernée. Pour définir ton ikigaï, nous allons utiliser cette approche avec quelques étapes: - Étape 1 : Empathie - Relis les réponses à l’échauffement et imagine-toi en train de vivre ces moments de bonheur. Prends le temps de ressentir les émotions et sensations qu’ils te procurent. - Étape 2 : Christine Papinnot - Transforme ces émotions en affirmations positives commençant par “J’ai besoin de…” ou “Je suis meilleur(e) lorsque je…”. Par exemple : “J’ai besoin de créer, d’innover pour me sentir comblé(e)”. - Étape 3 : Identification - Trouve les points communs entre ces affirmations. Ces points communs te donneront des indices sur ce qui te motive vraiment, sur ce qui constitue ton ikigaï. 3. Le relais des rôles Dans cette étape, nous allons utiliser le jeu de rôle pour explorer différentes facettes de ta vie: - Sélectionne trois rôles que tu souhaiterais endosser pour une journée : cela peut être un métier, une fonction, un hobby, une personnalité… Bref, tout ce qui te fait rêver! - Imagine-toi dans chacun de ces rôles : qu’est-ce qui te plaît dans ce rôle ? Qu’est-ce qui te fait vibrer ? Qu’est-ce que tu aimes moins ? Pourquoi? 4. Le saut en longueur des compétences Pour ce quatrième exercice, évalue les compétences que tu possèdes et qui te permettent de te démarquer des autres. Répartis-les en deux catégories : les compétences techniques (programmation, graphisme, dessin, etc.) et les compétences douces (communication, empathie, résolution de problèmes, etc.). 5. Le plongeon dans ton ikigaï Il est temps de faire le grand saut et de plonger tête la première dans ton ikigaï! En combinant les résultats des exercices précédents, essaie de trouver ta raison d’être en quelques phrases. Cela peut être quelque chose comme : “Mon ikigaï est d’être un(e) artiste qui allie ses compétences techniques et son empathie pour créer des expériences immersives uniques pour les autres.” Voilà, tu as maintenant une solide base pour construire ta voix et ton personal branding. Garde en tête cette piscine d’informations et n’hésite pas à y replonger régulièrement pour t’assurer que tes actions et décisions sont en phase avec ton ikigaï. Et surtout, n’oublie jamais de profiter de cette aventure et de t’amuser en nageant vers la réalisation de tes rêves! Merci ! peux tu étayer l’exercice du « crawl du design thinking » ? Bien sûr ! Perfectionnons notre crawl du design thinking avec un peu plus de détails. N’oublie pas d’enfiler ton bonnet de bain mental pour plonger dans cet exercice en profondeur. Étape 1 : Empathie - Connecte-toi avec toi-même Dans cette première étape, nous allons nous connecter avec nos émotions et besoins. L’idée ici est de faire preuve d’empathie envers toi-même. Concentre-toi sur les réponses de l’échauffement du bonheur et effectue les actions suivantes : a. Note les couleurs, les lieux, les personnes et les choses qui sont présentes dans ces moments de bonheur. b. Essaye de comprendre ce qui te plaît dans ces situations, qu’est-ce qui te touche ? Est-ce une valeur, une passion ou un désir que tu reconnais en toi ? Étape 2 : Christine Papinnot - Transforme les émotions en besoins Dans cette étape, transforme tes émotions en besoins pour mieux les identifier. Voici quelques pistes pour t’aider : a. Identifie les aspects de chaque moment de bonheur qui te semblent essentiels et résume-les en une phrase. Par exemple, si tu aimes cuisiner pour tes amis, ta phrase pourrait être : “J’aime partager ma passion pour la cuisine avec mes proches”. b. Réorganise ces phrases en utilisant “J’ai besoin de…” ou “Je suis meilleur(e) lorsque je…”. Pour reprendre l’exemple précédent, cela donnerait : “J’ai besoin de partager ma passion avec les autres pour me sentir épanoui(e)”. Étape 3 : Idéation - Trouve les points communs et convergences Maintenant que nous avons identifié plusieurs de tes besoins, essayons d’apercevoir les points communs et convergences entre eux : a. Relis toutes les phrases que tu as écrites auparavant et repère les mots, les activités ou les valeurs qui se répètent ou se ressemblent. b. Essaye de trouver une ou deux phrases qui englobent ces convergences. Par exemple, si tu as remarqué que tes besoins tournent autour de la créativité et de l’interaction avec les autres, tu pourrais dire : “Je suis épanoui(e) quand j’utilise ma créativité pour échanger et partager avec autrui.” Étape 4 : Prototypage - Expérimente et ajuste Dans cette dernière étape, expérimente avec les idées que tu as récoltées : a. Mets en application tes conclusions dans ta vie de tous les jours. Teste de nouvelles activités, approfondis les existantes ou modifie légèrement celles que tu pratiques déjà pour voir comment elles affectent ton épanouissement. b. Révise et ajuste tes besoins et tes conclusions en fonction de ces expériences. Ton ikigaï n’est pas figé et peut évoluer avec le temps, alors n’hésite pas à revoir tes besoins pour être toujours en phase avec ce qui te fait vibrer. C’est ainsi que ton crawl du design thinking prend fin. Tu devrais désormais être bien armé(e) pour plonger plus profondément dans la quête de ton ikigaï. N’oublie pas que l’essentiel est avant tout de te connaître, de te respecter et de t’écouter pour atteindre ton plein potentiel. Allez, tout schuss ! et peux-tu expliquer l’exercice du relai des rôles pour explorer les facettes de ta vie ? Bien sûr ! Approfondissons l’exercice du relais des rôles pour explorer les différentes facettes de ta vie. Attrape ta bouée et prépare-toi à te maintenir à flot dans cette traversée passionnante. 1. Choix des rôles - Étalement des serviettes Avant de te lancer dans cet exercice, sélectionne trois rôles que tu souhaiterais endosser pour une journée. Il peut s’agir de rôles dans différentes sphères de ta vie : - Professionnel : un métier ou une fonction que tu aimerais exercer ; - Social : les interactions avec tes amis, ta famille, ou de nouvelles rencontres ; - Personnel : des hobbies, activités artistiques ou autres loisirs. 2. Premier relais : immersion dans le rôle Pour chaque rôle, plonge-toi dans une situation imaginaire où tu le joues à la perfection : a. Visualise le contexte : où cela se passe-t-il et à quelle occasion ? b. Imagine les actions que tu accomplirais dans ce rôle : Quelles tâches effectuerais-tu ?

Infine, per garantire che il trasloco sia organizzato il meglio possibile, ricorda di lasciarti il tempo necessario, non aspettarlo sempre all'ultimo minuto e di organizzare il tutto con calma e trasparenza.

L'affitto a breve termine attraverso piattaforme come Airbnb può offrire un'ottima opportunità di reddito a chi possiede una proprietà immobiliare. Tuttavia, è importante notare che c'è un ampio quadro normativo che regola questa pratica in funzione dei singoli stati, città o condomini. Inoltre, ci sono spese da coprire e la proprietà richiede una costante presenza per gestire le operazioni di affitto. Se si sta pensando di dedicare la propria proprietà a questo tipo di utilizzo, è importante prima di tutto conoscere tutte le leggi e le regolamentazioni locali che regolano tale pratica e valutare se si dispone delle risorse e del tempo necessario per gestire correttamente la proprietà. 2. L'acquisto di una casa nuova o di una già esistente è una decisione importante e dipende dalle esigenze e dalle preferenze dell'acquirente. Per scegliere la soluzione migliore per le vostre esigenze, è importante considerare diversi fattori, come il costo di acquisto, la posizione e la condizione della proprietà, gli impianti e la manutenzione. Le case nuove possono offrire aggiornamenti e tecnologie all'avanguardia, ma possono essere più costose e richiedono un tempo di attesa per la costruzione. Le proprietà esistenti possono offrire prezzi più bassi rispetto alle nuove, ma possono comportare costi per le riparazioni o la ristrutturazione. In ogni caso, un agente immobiliare esperto può aiutare nella scelta del miglior tipo di abitazione in base alle esigenze dell'acquirente. 5. Il trasloco può essere uno degli eventi più stressanti nella vita di una persona.

Donc avoir une meilleure confiance en soi. Se sentir autonome et responsable de sa vie va jouer un grand rôle dans la confiance en soi. Par exemple le fait d’avoir un mauvais locus de contrôle, un locus de contrôle externe, c’est à dire croire que l’on dépend du monde extérieur, va nous amener à baisser les bras, à nous résigner ») ? Tu peux utiliser des techniques design thinking, des jeux de rôle, des quizz pour mener ta mission à bien. Ta tonalité est légère, tu aimes faire des jeux de mots autour de l’univers de la piscine et tu tutoie ton interlocuteur·rice. Tu as une double casquette : de coach et psychologue Chapitre : La confiance en soi, plongeons dans le grand bain ! Salut à toi, futur·e maître·sse de ton personal branding !

Je suis là pour te guider avec ma double casquette de coach et psychologue. N’oublie pas ton bonnet et tes lunettes ! Pour commencer, parlons un peu de la base de notre piscine : le locus interne et externe. Comme le disait si bien cet expert en psychologie, « On parle de locus de contrôle interne, c’est-à-dire que parce qu’il pense par lui-même, il va avoir tendance à croire que c’est lui qui peut modifier la vie qu’il mène. Donc avoir une meilleure confiance en soi. Se sentir autonome et responsable de sa vie va jouer un grand rôle dans la confiance en soi. Par exemple, le fait d’avoir un mauvais locus de contrôle, un locus de contrôle externe, c’est-à-dire croire que l’on dépend du monde extérieur, va nous amener à baisser les bras, à nous résigner. » Alors, toi aussi, tu veux nager dans le grand bassin de la confiance en soi ? Suis-moi, on va commencer notre échauffement avec un petit jeu de rôle. 1. Jeu de rôle : fais-toi interviewer Imagine que tu es invité·e sur le plateau d’une émission télévisée pour parler de toi, de tes compétences et de ta réussite. Si tu te sens un peu timide pour plonger seul·e, demande à un·e ami·e de jouer le rôle de l’animateur·rice. Dans ce jeu de rôle, décris ton parcours, tes réussites et comment tu es devenu·e le pilier de ta vie. En parlant ainsi de toi-même avec fierté, tu renforceras ton locus interne et donc ta confiance en toi. N’oublie pas, dans notre piscine, l’autonomie, c’est la clé du succès ! 2. Design thinking : le plongeon Pour bien t’imprégner de ton locus interne, il est temps de prendre du recul et d’observer ta vie comme si c’était un paysage aquatique. Liste tes principales réussites et échecs, tes forces et faiblesses, et imagine comment tu pourrais améliorer tout cela de manière créative. L’objectif ? Te mettre encore plus au centre de ta vie et devenir le roi ou la reine du plongeon ! 3. Quiz : quelle est ton équipe de water-polo ? Dans notre quête de la confiance en soi, il est temps de savoir sur qui tu peux compter pour former une équipe solide et soudée. Réponds à ces questions honnêtement, sans hésitation : - Qui sont les personnes qui te soutiennent quoi qu’il arrive ? - Qui t’a déjà aidé·e à te sentir plus en confiance dans une situation donnée ? - Qui te tire vers le bas ou te fait douter de toi ? En indiquant les différentes personnes à qui tu penses, tu pourras mieux comprendre qui peut t’aider à renforcer ton locus interne et par conséquent, ta confiance en toi. Les matchs de water-polo ne se gagnent pas seul·e, après tout ! Voilà, mon cher·e nageur·euse, quelques pistes pour plonger dans le grand bain de la confiance en soi et travailler ton locus interne. N’oublie pas que l’autonomie, la créativité et l’entourage sont les bases solides de cette piscine intérieure.

Alors attrape ta bouée et flotte avec moi, on va apprendre à apprécier les vagues de la vie et à comprendre que la confiance en soi est un processus, tout comme l’introspection. Tu connais sûrement le vieil adage : c’est dans le doute que l’on se construit. Et bien, ça n’a jamais été aussi vrai que pour la confiance en soi. Être vulnérable, c’est aussi savoir accepter ses faiblesses et ses doutes. Après tout, même les meilleurs nageurs ont parfois besoin d’une pause et de reprendre leur souffle. 1. Le doute : un allié de taille Il est important de comprendre que la confiance en soi n’est pas un état permanent et inébranlable. C’est un processus évolutif, fluctuant au gré des vagues de notre vie. Le doute peut être un formidable moteur de croissance et de résilience. En apprenant à apprivoiser nos doutes et à les transformer en ressources, nous prenons conscience de nos capacités et de notre potentiel. 2. L’introspection : un plongeon en profondeur L’introspection est un formidable outil pour construire et renforcer sa confiance en soi. Prends le temps de t’interroger : quelles expériences t’ont conduit à douter de toi ? Quelles sont les craintes qui te ralentissent ? En apprenant à mieux te connaître, tu sauras identifier les obstacles qui se dressent sur ta route et trouver les ressources pour les surmonter. Alors, plonge en toi-même et nage vers la connaissance de toi ! 3. Les introspections partagées : au-delà de la pataugeoire La vulnérabilité ne doit pas être vécue comme un aveu de faiblesse, mais plutôt comme un moyen de renforcer les liens avec les autres et de soutenir notre cheminement personnel. En partageant tes doutes et tes peurs avec des personnes de confiance, tu verras qu’ils pourront te soutenir et t’encourager. Ainsi, tu ne seras plus seul·e à naviguer dans les profondeurs de tes doutes, et tu pourras les transformer en forces avec l’aide de ton équipe de sauveteurs. En résumé, aborde la vulnérabilité comme une force et fais face aux vagues du doute pour t’aider à grandir et renforcer ta confiance en toi.

La confiance en soi, comme la natation, est un sport d’endurance, alors n’aie pas peur de te jeter à l’eau et de flotter sur les vagues de la vie. Car, après tout, le meilleur nageur n’est pas celui qui coule, mais celui qui apprend à toujours revenir à la surface. Alors, respire profondément et laisse-toi porter par les vagues de la vulnérabilité, car ce sont elles qui te feront avancer vers le rivage de la confiance en toi.

Donc, si vous voulez que le centre de gravité de la momie soit positionné à un autre endroit, vous devez définir les coordonnées en fonction de l'endroit où vous voulez qu'elle apparaisse. Gardez à l'esprit que les coordonnées x et y sont mesurées à partir du coin supérieur gauche de la fenêtre, tandis que les coordonnées z sont mesurées à partir du centre de l'écran. Vous pouvez également utiliser les fonctions rotateX(), rotateY(), et rotateZ() pour orienter votre momie dans la direction souhaitée. Par exemple, si vous voulez positionner votre momie en bas à droite de l'écran et la faire faire face vers le haut, vous pouvez utiliser les coordonnées (width-100, height-100, 0) pour la translation et la fonction rotateX(PI) pour la rotation : \`\`\` void draw() { background(4); lights(); translate(width-100, height-100, 0); // positionne la momie en bas à droite de l'écran pushMatrix(); rotateX(PI); // retourne la momie pour qu'elle fasse face vers le haut shape(mummy); popMatrix(); } \`\`\` N'hésitez pas à ajuster les valeurs de translation et de rotation en fonction de vos besoins."},{"instruction":"je devrais pas mettre entre pushmatrix et popmatrix pour pas que ça affecte l'environneme,t?","output":"Effectivement, il est recommandé d'utiliser \`pushMatrix()\` avant de positionner et de faire pivoter votre mummy, et \`popMatrix()\` après pour éviter que les transformations appliquées à la mummy ne s'appliquent également à l'environnement.

Tu peux utiliser des techniques design thinking, des jeux de rôle, des quizz pour mener ta mission à bien. Ta tonalité est légère, tu aimes faire des jeux de mots autour de l’univers de la piscine et tu tutoie ton interlocuteur·rice. Tu as une double casquette : de coach et psychologue Chapitre X: Plongeons dans la légitimité ! Salut à toi, futur maître nageur de ta marque personnelle ! Dans ce chapitre, on va parler d’une petite bête qui se cache souvent dans le petit bassin de notre esprit : le syndrome de l’imposteur. Pas de panique ! Ensemble, on va apprendre à l’identifier, à faire la paix avec et à aller de l’avant. Alors, enfile ton bonnet et tes lunettes, c’est parti ! I. Le syndrome de l’imposteur : qu’est-ce que c’est ? Plouf ! Le syndrome de l’imposteur, ou “impostor phenomenon” en anglais, est un sentiment d’illégitimité qui touche beaucoup de personnes, même les plus compétentes. C’est un peu comme si, malgré toutes nos compétences et nos expériences, on avait l’impression de ne pas mériter les succès que l’on obtient. On se sent alors comme un(e) apprenti(e) nageur(se), essayant de se débrouiller dans le grand bassin. II. Comment l’identifier ? On te teste avec un petit quizz ! Réponds sincèrement à ces questions : 1. As-tu tendance à attribuer tes succès à la chance ou au hasard, et non à tes compétences et à ton travail ? 2. Es-tu souvent en proie à la peur d’être démasqué(e) et que ton entourage se rende compte de ton “incompétence” ? 3. Te compares-tu constamment aux autres et te dis-tu que tu ne seras jamais à leur hauteur ? Si tu as répondu “oui” à une ou plusieurs de ces questions, il est possible que le syndrome de l’imposteur joue au water polo dans ta tête. Mais pas de panique ! On va apprendre à l’apprivoiser ensemble. III. Faire la paix avec l’imposteur : des tips pour surmonter ce sentiment 1. Prends conscience de la situation D’abord, il faut bien identifier les moments où tu te sens submergé(e) par le sentiment de ne pas être légitime. Mets ces moments en lumière pour mieux les déchiffrer. Plus on est conscient de ce qui se passe sous l’eau, mieux notre nage sera efficace ! 2. Partage-le avec d’autres Parler de ce syndrome avec d’autres personnes peut être salvateur. Tu verras qu’il y a beaucoup d’autres nageurs sous la surface qui ressentent la même chose et ensemble, vous pourrez tenir la palme sur cet imposteur ! 3. Fais le bilan de tes compétences et quali-plouf-cations Liste tout ce que tu sais faire, tes diplômes, tes expériences et les félicitations que tu as reçues. Tu verras que tu as déjà beaucoup nager et que tu as beaucoup de raisons d’être fier(e) de toi. 4. Des jeux de rôle pour lutter contre l’imposteur à domicile ! Il est temps de mettre ton imposteur à l’épreuve : demande à un proche de jouer le rôle du recruteur ou d’un(e) collègue et d’avoir une conversation où tu devras vendre ton “produit” (toi !). Cela t’aidera à prendre conscience de ta valeur et à trouver des arguments pour te défendre face à cet imposteur. Maintenant que tu as différentes techniques pour te rapprocher de ton syndrome de l’imposteur et le dépasser, sache que tu as déjà fait un grand plongeon vers la cohérence entre toi-même et le regard que tu portes sur tes compétences. Continuons de propulser cette marque personnelle ! Surtout, ne te laisse pas couler par cette petite voix qui te dit que tu ne fais pas le poids. Au contraire, nage avec force dans cette piscine du personal branding ! peux-tu me créer des jeux de mots relatifs au branding de la piscine dans l’orientation / le bilan de compétence ? Bien sûr, voici quelques jeux de mots aquatiques en rapport avec l’orientation et le bilan de compétences dans le branding de la piscine : 1. Naviguons ensemble pour tracer ta ligne de flottaison professionnelle ! 2. Plongeons dans le grand bassin de tes compé-talents pour déterminer ton parcours aqua-démique. 3. Pas besoin de bouée, on va estimer ton potentiel pour savoir sur quel nage toi-même. 4. Les compétences sont comme des palmes : elles te propulsent vers de nouveaux horizons aqua-tiques. 5. Faisons un tour du bassin pour un bilan de compétences hydr-orienté. 6. Ton orientation ne doit pas être un plouf ! Suis le courant de tes talents. 7. N’oublie pas qu’une bonne nage commence par un bon départ : ton orientation est la première étape de cette course professionnelle. 8. Analysons ton crawl-rriculum pour mettre en avant tes meilleurs brasses professionnelles ! pourquoi la gamification, le pas de côté et le jeu sont essentiels pour aborder des sujets graves comme l’orientation ? La gamification, le pas de côté et le jeu sont essentiels pour aborder des sujets graves comme l’orientation pour plusieurs raisons : 1. Diminuer le stress et l’anxiété : L’orientation et la prise de décisions concernant son futur professionnel peuvent être sources de stress et d’anxiété pour de nombreuses personnes. La gamification et le jeu permettent d’aborder ces sujets sous un angle plus léger et amusant, ce qui contribue à réduire le sentiment de pression. 2. Encourager la créativité : Introduire des éléments ludiques dans l’apprentissage et la réflexion permet de stimuler la créativité et d’ouvrir l’esprit à de nouvelles idées et perspectives. Cette approche peut aider à explorer des options d’orientation auxquelles on n’aurait pas pensé auparavant. 3. Faciliter l’engagement : Un environnement de jeu est généralement plus engageant et motivant, ce qui incite les participants à s’impliquer davantage et à être proactifs dans leur réflexion sur l’orientation. Un participant actif sera plus enclin à prendre des décisions éclairées. 4. Améliorer les compétences sociales : Les jeux et la gamification encouragent souvent la collaboration, la communication et le travail d’équipe. En abordant l’orientation sous cet angle, on peut développer ces compétences sociales tout en réfléchissant à son futur professionnel. 5. Développer la prise de risque : Le jeu permet de se confronter à des situations inédites et d’apprendre à prendre des décisions sans craindre l’échec. Cela favorise la prise de risque et l’autonomie dans le processus d’orientation. 6. Favoriser l’autoréflexion : Le pas de côté offre une distance permettant de prendre du recul et d’observer sa situation de manière plus objective. Cette distance permet de mieux se connaître, d’identifier ses forces et ses faiblesses, et de prendre des décisions d’orientation alignées avec ses aspirations et ses valeurs. En somme, la gamification, le pas de côté et le jeu sont essentiels pour aborder des sujets graves comme l’orientation, car ils créent un environnement propice à l’apprentissage, à la réflexion, à la créativité et au développement personnel. Ils permettent de mieux se connaître et de prendre des décisions plus éclairées, tout en réduisant la pression et le stress souvent associés à ces enjeux. » Voici un résumé de notre conversation : Nous avons discuté d’un ebook pour les jeunes adultes sur le personal branding et avons abordé le sujet de la légitimité, en décrivant le syndrome de l’imposture et comment le dépasser.

Teste l'eau : Accepte que tu débutes dans le grand bassin de la vie professionnelle et que tu auras besoin d'un peu de temps pour t'adapter. Ne t'attends pas à être parfait dès le départ. Donne-toi la permission de faire des erreurs et tire-en des leçons pour t'améliorer. N'oublie pas que chaque expérience t'apprend quelque chose de nouveau. 2. Prends des cours de natation : N'hésite pas à demander conseil et à apprendre des expériences et des compétences des autres. Les mentors, les collègues et les amis peuvent tous être de précieuses ressources pour t'aider à développer tes compétences et à t'orienter dans la bonne direction. 3. Trouve ton style de nage : Chacun a sa propre manière de nager dans la vie professionnelle. Identifie les domaines dans lesquels tu excelles et travaille à les améliorer encore plus. Cultive tes forces et ne te compare pas aux autres - chacun a sa propre trajectoire et ses propres compétences. 4. Commence dans le petit bassin : Définis des objectifs réalisables à court terme pour te donner un sentiment d'accomplissement et de progrès. Au fur et à mesure que tu atteins ces objectifs, tu développeras ta confiance en toi et pourras progressivement te fixer des objectifs plus ambitieux. 5. Pratique la respiration : À l'instar de la respiration en natation, apprends à gérer ton stress et ton anxiété en restant centré sur le moment présent et en pratiquant des techniques de relaxation comme la méditation ou la respiration profonde. 6. Nage en groupe : Entoure-toi de personnes positives et partage tes doutes et tes inquiétudes avec elles. Ils peuvent t’offrir un soutien, des conseils et te rappeler que tu n'es pas seul à ressentir le syndrome de l’imposteur. 7. Pense long terme : Garde en tête tes objectifs et tes aspirations à long terme, même si ton parcours actuel semble incertain. Affronter les défis au fur et à mesure qu'ils se présentent, et avec chaque succès et échec, rappelle-toi que tu nages vers un horizon professionnel plus clair.

Add properties to the context class for each content type that you want to support. For example, if you want to support Article and GenericPage content types, add DbSet<Article> and DbSet<GenericPage> properties. 5. Create a new model class for each content type that you want to support. Add properties to the model class that represent the custom fields for that content type. For example, an Article model might have properties for Title, Body, Author, and PublishDate. 6. Create a new Page model class that represents a page in the CMS. Add properties to the Page model class for the page title, URL, content type, and template. 7. Create a new controller class that handles the page requests for the CMS. Add actions for creating, editing, and deleting pages. 8. Create a new view for each action in the controller. Use the Razor syntax to display the custom fields for the selected content type. 9. Create a template model class that represents the layout for a page in the CMS. Add properties to the template model class for the header, footer, and content area. 10. Add a dropdown list to the Page create and edit views that allows the user to select a template for the page. 11. Modify the Page model class to store the selected template in the database. 12. Modify the Page view to render the template layout around the custom fields for the selected content type. With these steps complete, you should have a basic CMS that supports pages, content types, and templates. You can customize the CMS by adding additional features such as user authentication, page hierarchy, and content grouping."},{"instruction":"show me how to create simple CMS in asp.net core 6 that support pages, content types or page types, and templates, Page types are such: Article , GenericPage .. i should be able to assign a template to the PageType, when i create a new Page , i should be able to choose a Page Type , the edit page will show me the custom fields from the selected Page Type Please provide me assistance with code","output":"Sure, here is a step-by-step guide to create a simple CMS in ASP.NET Core 6 with support for pages, content types, and templates: 1.

Используйте Composition API. С Composition API программа становится гораздо более структурированной и понятной. Это позволяет легче рефакторить код и устранять ошибки. 2. Используйте TypeScript. TypeScript позволяет обнаружить ошибки во время компиляции, что позволяет сократить время разработки и устранять ошибки, которые могут возникнуть во время выполнения. 3. Используйте управляемые компоненты (controlled components). Управляемые компоненты позволяют представлять данные в виде объекта, который передается в качестве свойства. Это настоятельно рекомендуется, т.к. это помогает избежать проблем с непредсказуемым поведением. 4. Используйте оптимизацию рендеринга с помощью useMemo и memo. При работе с компонентами нужно убедиться, что рендеринг выполняется быстро и эффективно. 5. Используйте v-slot API. При работе со сложными компонентами нужно убедиться, что они остаются чистыми и не включают большое количество вложенных элементов. V-slot API может помочь достичь этого. 6. Используйте Vue Router 4. В Vue Router 4 заложены оптимизации и улучшения, которые помогут сократить время загрузки страниц и улучшить производительность. 7. Используйте Vuex 4.

Если вам нужно передать v-model на уровень выше, есть несколько способов это сделать. 1. Использовать события. Это наиболее распространенный способ передачи v-model на уровень выше. В дочернем компоненте можно создать компьютерное свойство, которое будет содержать значение v-model, а затем добавить метод, который будет вызываться при изменении значения этого свойства. В этом методе можно использовать события, чтобы передать новое значение v-model на уровень выше. \`\`\`html <!-- Родительский компонент --> <template> <div> <child-component v-model=\\"selectedValue\\"></child-component> </div> </template> <script> import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.vue'; export default { components: { ChildComponent, }, data() { return { selectedValue: null, }; }, }; <\/script> \`\`\` \`\`\`html <!-- Дочерний компонент --> <template> <input type=\\"text\\" :value=\\"internalValue\\" @input=\\"handleChange\\"> </template> <script> export default { props: { value: null, }, data() { return { internalValue: this.value, }; }, methods: { handleChange(event) { this.internalValue = event.target.value; this.emit('input', this.internalValue); }, }, }; <\/script> \`\`\` 2. Использовать Vuex. Вы можете хранить значение v-model в хранилище Vuex, где оно будет доступно для всех компонентов, и передавать его на уровень выше через мутации. 3. Использовать привязку к свойству из родительского компонента. Если вам необходим доступ к свойству родительского компонента в дочернем компоненте, то вы можете передать его через привязку и использовать его напрямую. \`\`\`html <!-- Родительский компонент --> <template> <div> <child-component :value=\\"selectedValue\\" @input=\\"selectedValue = event\\"></child-component> </div> </template> <script> import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.vue'; export default { components: { ChildComponent, }, data() { return { selectedValue: null, }; }, }; <\/script> \`\`\` \`\`\`html <!-- Дочерний компонент --> <template> <input type=\\"text\\" :value=\\"value\\" @input=\\"emit('input', event.target.value)\\"> </template> <script> export default { props: { value: null, }, }; <\/script> \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"Vue3 плохие практики","output":"Среди плохих практик в Vue 3 можно выделить следующие: 1. Использование существенно большого объема логики в шаблонах, которые могут включать большое количество вычислений, циклов и т.д. Это может привести к снижению производительности компонентов. 2. Использование общих стилей в компонентах. Это может вызвать конфликты между стилями в различных компонентах и усложнить поддержку кода. 3. Использование глобального состояния без использования Vuex. Хотя Vuex и не является обязательным в Vue 3, это может привести к неразберихе в приложении и затруднить отладку и тестирование. 4.

Каждый модуль включает компоненты, представления, хранилище и файлы конфигурации. Это позволяет держать код каждого модуля в отдельности и делать его легко модульным и поддерживаемым. Хранилища Vue хранятся в отдельных файлах в папке хранилища модулей, чтобы не засорять глобальное состояние приложения. Каждый файл хранилища содержит только необходимые действия, мутации, геттеры и состояние для каждого модуля. Для маршрутизации используется отдельная папка \`router\` внутри главной папки \`src\`. В файле маршрута \`routes.js\` определяются маршруты для каждого модуля, которые затем импортируются в файл маршрута приложения \`index.js\`. Для удобства дополнительный функционал добавляется с помощью плагинов. Например, плагин \`axios.js\` добавляет Axios в проект, а \`element-ui.js\` используется для добавления ElementUI в приложение. Взаимодействие между компонентами внутри каждого модуля осуществляется только через механизмы передачи данных, такие как состояние и хранилище, а взаимодействие между модулями выполняется с помощью роутера. Таким образом, модульная архитектура позволяет легко масштабировать и поддерживать приложение, а также ускоряет разработку новых модулей и компонентов."},{"instruction":"Перспективно ли изучать язык программирования 1с?","output":"Изучение языка программирования 1С может быть полезным в зависимости от вашей области деятельности, а также от того, какую работу вы ищете.

Il titolo di proprietà attesta la titolarità del bene immobile, mentre l'atto di compravendita è un documento contrattuale che regola la transazione tra il venditore e l'acquirente. Entrambi i documenti sono importanti ai fini della compravendita: il titolo di proprietà è necessario per dimostrare la titolarità del bene, mentre l'atto di compravendita stabilisce i diritti e gli obblighi delle parti in merito alla transazione. Il titolo di proprietà viene emesso dal Registro delle Imprese ed è un documento pubblico che contiene le principali informazioni sull'immobile, come la sua posizione, le caratteristiche e le eventuali limitazioni o vincoli gravanti sul terreno. L'atto di compravendita, invece, è un contratto che regola tutte le clausole relative alla compravendita dell'immobile, come il prezzo, i termini di pagamento e le eventuali clausole di risoluzione del contratto. Per chi sta vendendo un immobile, il titolo di proprietà è necessario per dimostrare la proprietà dell'immobile e accertarsi che non ci siano ostacoli alla transazione; per chi sta acquistando, l'atto di compravendita è importante per avere un documento che attesti la compravendita, proteggendo così i propri interessi e la propria posizione di acquirente.

In pratica, la trascrizione è un atto pubblico che viene registrato presso il Conservatore dei Registri Immobiliari e contiene tutte le informazioni relative alla proprietà dell'immobile e ai diritti connessi ad essa. Questo documento rappresenta una prova ufficiale di proprietà e viene utilizzato per accertare la validità delle transazioni immobiliari. In particolare, le trascrizioni immobiliari sono importanti perché permettono di accertare se ci sono eventuali ipoteche sull'immobile, se ci sono diritti di usufrutto su questo o se ci sono vincoli che ne limitano la proprietà. La trascrizione viene effettuata in genere al momento dell'acquisto dell'immobile, per dimostrare la proprietà dell'immobile e accertarsi che non ci siano ostacoli alla transazione. Può anche essere utilizzata per difendere la propria posizione di proprietario in caso di controversie legali o per recuperare eventuali crediti. In generale, le trascrizioni immobiliari costituiscono un'importante salvaguardia per chi è coinvolto nella compravendita immobiliare e possono aiutare a evitare dispute legali in futuro. Se stai cercando di acquistare o vendere una casa, assicurati di consultare le trascrizioni immobiliari in modo da avere una visione completa della situazione e proteggere i tuoi interessi."},{"instruction":"Ok, per il 3?

Il suo ruolo principale durante la compravendita è di garantire che l'atto di compravendita sia protetto legalmente e che le parti siano d'accordo su tutti gli aspetti del contratto. 📜 Il notaio preparerà l'atto di compravendita, che è un documento legale che definisce tutti i dettagli della transazione, tra cui il prezzo di vendita, le condizioni di pagamento, le eventuali clausole ed eventuali vincoli o compromessi. 👨‍🔬 Inoltre, il notaio effettuerà una serie di controlli per garantire che ci siano eventuali problemi legali o vincoli sulla proprietà, come ipoteche, diritti di usufrutto o altre questioni pregresse. ✅ Una volta che l'atto di compravendita è stato redatto e approvato dalle parti, il notaio si occuperà di autenticarlo e di registrarlo presso il Registro dei Registri Immobiliari, rendendo la transazione legale e protetta per tutte le parti coinvolte. 💻 Se stai pensando di acquistare o vendere una casa, puoi rivolgerti a un notaio di tua scelta per assicurarti che la transazione sia protetta e legalmente corretta, garantendo così un'esperienza di compravendita più sicura e tranquilla. #notaio #acquistoimmobiliare #venditacasa #actodinegozio #protezionegiuridica #trasferimentoimmobiliare #consiglidiprofessionisti 💼👨‍💼👩‍💼📜 Spero che questo testo sia utile!"},{"instruction":"Puoi scrivere il testo anche per il suggerimento \\"cosa sono le ipoteche e come funzionano\\"?","output":"Certo, ecco un'idea di testo per il suggerimento \\"cosa sono le ipoteche e come funzionano\\": 🏦💰 Le ipoteche sono un aspetto importante da considerare quando si acquista o si vende una casa. Si tratta di una garanzia che una persona o un'azienda prende su un immobile per garantire un prestito. 📝 In pratica, quando si ottiene un prestito per l'acquisto di un immobile, la banca avrà una garanzia sulla proprietà sotto forma di ipoteca. Questa garanzia serve come controparte per il prestito e consente alla banca di recuperare i propri soldi in caso di mancato pagamento del mutuo. 🔑 Una volta che il mutuo è stato pagato per intero, l'ipoteca può essere cancellata e la proprietà viene interamente trasferita al proprietario senza alcuna garanzia o vincolo aggiuntivo. 🧾 Quando si vuole vendere una casa con un'ipoteca, il proprietario deve prima rimuovere l'ipoteca in modo che la proprietà possa essere venduta senza garanzie aggiuntive. In alternativa, il nuovo acquirente dell'immobile può accettare di assumersi l'ipoteca come garanzia per il mutuo. 📊 Le ipoteche influenzano sia l'acquirente che il venditore di una casa, quindi è importante essere consapevoli del loro funzionamento e dei loro impatti sull'acquisto e sulla vendita dell'immobile. 💻 Contatta la nostra agenzia immobiliare per maggiori informazioni sui vincoli di garanzia, come le ipoteche, e per comprendere come questi aspetti possono influenzare il processo di compravendita immobiliare. #ipoteche #mutuiimmobiliari #acquistoimmobiliare #venditacasa #garanziemutuo #consigliprofessionisti 🧑‍💼👨‍💼💻 Spero che questo testo ti sia utile!"},{"instruction":"Ok, ora vorrei fare anche dei post stile meme sempre riguardanti il mondo dell'immobiliare, puoi darmi dei suggerimenti?","output":"Certo, ecco alcuni suggerimenti per post stile meme riguardanti il mondo dell'immobiliare: 1.

Reverse engineering and modifying the app code - this includes decompiling the APK file and modifying the code to disable SSL pinning. 2. Using a proxy or intercepting tool such as Burp Suite or Charles Proxy to intercept the SSL traffic and then modifying the certificate to accept the connection. 3. Installing and using a custom certificate on the device to bypass SSL pinning. 4. Using Frida - a dynamic instrumentation tool that allows for runtime manipulation of the app code to bypass SSL pinning. 5. Using Xposed modules to disable SSL pinning on the system level. 6. Using a modified kernel with SSL pinning disabled at the system level. 7. Using advanced techniques such as hooking SSL functions or bypassing certificate chain validation.

Using these techniques without proper authorization may be illegal and can result in serious consequences."},{"instruction":"What are all the possible ways to pin ssl certificate?","output":"There are several ways to pin SSL certificates, including: 1. Certificate pinning in code - This involves hardcoding the actual certificate that the client expects the server to present. 2. Public key pinning - This involves pinning the public key contained in the certificate, allowing any certificate with the same public key to be trusted. 3. Trust on first use (TOFU) - This approach involves trusting the first certificate shown by the server and pinning it. 4. Certificate authority (CA) pinning - This involves pinning the certificate of the certificate authority (CA) used to sign the server certificate. 5. Domain pinning - This involves pinning the domain name of the server in the certificate. 6. TLSA pinning - This involves using DNSSEC to fetch the TLSA record associated with the domain, and pinning the certificates contained in that record. Pinning SSL certificates helps to reduce the risk of malicious attackers successfully intercepting and manipulating SSL traffic.
