Write a story where she decides to see how he is doing, and sees him listening to cool music, with headphones wrapped around his gelatinous body It had been a busy week for Gloopy. As a shape-shifting alien, he was constantly being called upon to help out with various tasks on their home planet. But despite the hectic schedule, he always found time to relax and unwind with his best friend, Glitter. One day, Glitter decided to check in on Gloopy to see how he was doing. She made her way to his living quarters and found him lying on his blob-like form, headphones wrapped around his gelatinous body. He had a contented smile on his face as he listened to the cool music playing through the headphones. “Hey Gloopy, what are you listening to?” Glitter asked, floating over to him. Gloopy opened his eyes and grinned at his friend. “Oh, just some tunes I picked up from a neighboring planet. It’s really relaxing and helps me decompress after a long day.” Glitter nodded in understanding. “That’s great, you deserve some rest after all the hard work you’ve been putting in. Mind if I join you?” Gloopy happily moved over, making space for Glitter to settle down next to him. They lay there in comfortable silence, listening to the music and enjoying each other’s company. As the music played on, Glitter couldn’t help but feel grateful for her friendship with Gloopy. He may be a teal blob of slime, but he was the most caring and supportive friend she could ask for. And with him by her side, she knew that no matter what challenges came their way, they would always have each other. With a smile on her face, Glitter snuggled closer to Gloopy, feeling the warmth of their bond enveloping them both. And in that moment, listening to the calming music, she knew that there was nowhere else she would rather be than right here with her best friend. Write a story where a green alien touches him, is amazed that his hand sinks into the gelatinous substance, and that he is amazed he is made of slime One day, as Gloopy was relaxing in his living quarters, a curious green alien approached him. Intrigued by Gloopy’s malleable nature, the alien reached out a hand and gently touched him. To his surprise, his hand sank into Gloopy’s gelatinous substance, feeling the cool and smooth texture beneath his fingers. The green alien’s eyes widened in amazement as he realized that Gloopy was made of slime. He had never encountered anything like it before and was fascinated by the unique abilities of the teal blob. Gloopy, for his part, chuckled at the alien’s reaction and morphed his form to engulf the alien’s hand in a gentle hug. “It’s all right, I’m used to it,” Gloopy said with a grin. “Being able to shape-shift has its perks, you know.” The green alien nodded, still in awe of Gloopy’s unusual composition. He couldn’t help but marvel at the way Gloopy could change his form at will, molding himself into different shapes and sizes. It was a talent that the alien had never imagined possible, and he found himself admiring Gloopy’s versatility and adaptability. As the green alien continued to interact with Gloopy, he realized that despite their differences, they both shared a sense of camaraderie and friendship. Gloopy’s unique nature may have been surprising at first, but it was ultimately what brought them together and strengthened their bond. And so, the green alien spent the rest of the day getting to know Gloopy better, learning about his abilities and enjoying the company of his new friend. As they laughed and talked, the alien couldn’t help but feel grateful for the chance encounter that led him to discover the amazing teal blob of slime who had become an important part of his life. Write a story where A evil bounty hunter shoots him, resulting in teal slime splattered but the they start moving and reforming, It turns out he can reform from even the smallest drop, and with a tentacle like appendage, he reaches for a phone and calls the space police and has the hunter brought to justice Gloopy was enjoying a peaceful afternoon on his home planet when the tranquility was suddenly shattered by the appearance of a menacing figure - an evil bounty hunter looking to capture him. Before Gloopy could react, the hunter fired a powerful blast from his blaster, hitting Gloopy directly and causing teal slime to splatter all around. At first, it seemed like Gloopy had been defeated as his form dispersed into countless tiny droplets of slime. The bounty hunter sneered in triumph. But to his horror, the splattered teal slime began to move and reform, each droplet connecting to the others and slowly piecing Gloopy back together. The evil bounty hunter watched in shock as Gloopy’s slime started to reform and regenerate, his teal body reshaping and taking form once again. And to the hunter’s surprise, Gloopy extended a tentacle-like appendage, reaching for a nearby communication device. With determination in his gooey form, Gloopy managed to reach the phone and dial the emergency line for the space police. His voice, though gurgled and distorted, came through the receiver as he reported the actions of the evil bounty hunter and requested immediate assistance. The space police responded swiftly, arriving at the scene to find the hunter standing over Gloopy, who had fully reformed and was prepared to defend himself. The evil bounty hunter was no match for the combined forces of the space police and Gloopy, who used his shape-shifting abilities to outmaneuver and subdue the villain. In the end, justice was served as the evil bounty hunter was apprehended and taken into custody by the space police. Gloopy’s resilience and quick thinking had saved him from capture and allowed him to bring the criminal to justice. As the space police commended Gloopy for his bravery and resourcefulness, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride in his abilities. Despite his slimy nature, he had proven that he was a force to be reckoned with, able to overcome even the most dangerous of adversaries. And as he stood among his friends and allies, he knew that no one would ever underestimate the teal blob of slime again. Write that story from Glitter’s POV, she almost cried Glitter watched in horror as the evil bounty hunter took aim at Gloopy, her best friend. The blast hit Gloopy directly, causing his teal slime to splatter in all directions. Tears pricked at the corners of Glitter’s sparkling fuschia eyes as she saw Gloopy’s form disperse into countless droplets of slime on the ground. As the bounty hunter sneered in triumph, Glitter’s heart ached with fear. But then, something miraculous happened. The teal slime began to move and reform, each droplet connecting back together. Gloopy was piecing himself back together, defying all odds and showing off his incredible ability to regenerate. Glitter felt a surge of relief and awe as she watched Gloopy reform before her eyes. Her tears of fear turned into tears of pride as she saw her best friend stand tall once more, ready to take on the evil bounty hunter. She had always known Gloopy was special, but this display of resilience and determination left her speechless. When Gloopy extended a tentacle-like appendage and reached for the phone, calling the space police for help, Glitter’s admiration for him grew even stronger. She could see the bravery and strength within her friend, and she couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of love and gratitude for him. As the space police arrived and apprehended the bounty hunter, Glitter floated over to Gloopy, her sparkling form shimmering with relief. She hovered next to him, almost overwhelmed with emotion as she witnessed his victory over the villain. With a quivering voice, Glitter expressed her feelings to Gloopy, “I… I was so scared. I thought I lost you, my dear friend. But you… you are truly incredible, Gloopy. I almost cried when I saw you reforming from those tiny droplets. I am so grateful for you, and so proud to call you my best friend.” Gloopy turned to Glitter, a warm smile spreading across his teal slime. “Thank you, Glitter,” he said softly. “I couldn’t have done it without you by my side. Your support means everything to me.” And as they stood together, basking in the victory and their unbreakable bond, Glitter knew that she would always be there for Gloopy, no matter what challenges they faced. They were more than just friends – they were partners in crime, united in strength and love. And with tears glistening in her eyes, Glitter knew that Gloopy would forever hold a special place in her sparkling heart. Write a story where Glitter talks to a tentacled creature while Gloopy is in the bathroom While Gloopy was busy in the bathroom taking care of his slimey business, Glitter decided to explore their surroundings on their home planet. She floated through the corridors until she came across a room filled with strange and fascinating creatures. One in particular caught her attention - a tentacled creature with shimmering scales and curious eyes. Glitter approached the tentacled creature, her sparkling fuschia form radiating with curiosity. The creature turned to her, its tentacles gently waving in the air as it observed the glittering alien before it. With a gentle smile, Glitter started a conversation with the creature, fascinated by its unique appearance and mysterious aura. “Hello there, I’m Glitter. What’s your name?” she asked, her voice gentle and welcoming. The tentacled creature regarded her with a blend of curiosity and warmth. It responded in a melodic and unfamiliar language, its tentacles moving in intricate patterns that seemed to convey meaning. Glitter couldn’t understand the words, but she could sense the creature’s friendly nature and willingness to communicate. As they continued to interact, Glitter and the tentacled creature found ways to communicate through gestures, expressions, and the universal language of friendship. They shared stories about their respective worlds, exchanged knowledge about their cultures, and bonded over their shared love for exploration and discovery. In the midst of their conversation, Gloopy emerged from the bathroom, his teal slime glistening under the light. He was surprised to see Glitter engaged in conversation with the tentacled creature, but he couldn’t help but smile at the sight. It warmed his gelatinous heart to see his best friend forming connections with other beings, even in his absence. Approaching them, Gloopy joined the conversation, introducing himself to the tentacled creature and exchanging greetings. The creature responded in kind, its tentacles forming complex patterns that seemed to convey joy and acceptance. As they continued to talk and share stories, Glitter, Gloopy, and the tentacled creature discovered a newfound kinship that transcended language and appearance. They laughed, learned, and bonded over their shared moments of connection, grateful for the opportunity to forge friendships across different worlds. And as they floated together, bathed in the glow of friendship and understanding, Glitter couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of gratitude for the beautiful encounters that life had to offer. In that moment, amidst laughter and camaraderie, she knew that the universe was full of wonders waiting to be explored and cherished. Write a story where a human traveler wonders how creatures like them can even exist while pointing at them, confused by their amorphous, slime body The human traveler had journeyed far across the cosmos, seen many wonders, and encountered various forms of life. But nothing prepared him for the sight of Gloopy and Glitter. As he strolled through the intergalactic bazaar, a hive of chatter and exotic items from a thousand worlds, his eyes fell upon the pair: one a teal blob with headphones slack around its body, and the other a sparkling fuschia entity, hovering nearby. “Excuse me,” the traveler said, trying to mask his astonishment as he approached them. “How do creatures like you even exist?” He pointed at them, his finger moving from one to the other, clearly baffled by their amorphous, slime forms. Gloopy, who had just removed his headphones, turned his gelatinous face toward the traveler and reshaped his ‘body’ to form what resembled a head with an amiable expression. “You know, we get that a lot,” Gloopy replied in a casual tone, his voice emanating from within his slime form. “We’re just different expressions of life. It’s like how on your planet, you have humans, octopuses, and things that are even stranger.” Glitter shimmered intensely for a moment, as if laughing. “Yeah, and just because we don’t have bones or skin like you do, doesn’t make us any less real.” The traveler knelt down, inspecting Gloopy more closely. “Forgive me, it’s not every day you see a sentient blob of slime… I mean—” “No offense taken,” Gloopy interjected with a morphing smile. “We understand our appearance can be quite, well, alien.” The human nodded slowly, his curiosity piqued. “Do you have organs like us? Bones or…anything?” he asked, his gaze drifting from Gloopy to Glitter and back again. Glitter giggled, a sparkling sound that echoed like tiny bells. “Nope! We’re one hundred percent slime based. We have specialized cells that can do all the necessary functions: take in nutrients, expel waste, you name it.” “And we can morph and stretch, which comes in handy,” Gloopy added, demonstrating by extending an arm-like appendage to twice its original length. “So, you’re basically immortal then? You can’t be hurt?” the traveler mused aloud. “Not exactly,” Gloopy responded, his texture turning a bit more serious. “We can get hurt, but as you may have noticed, we can recover from many injuries by re-forming our bodies.” The traveler stood up, a newfound respect etched upon his face. “Incredible. I’ve studied exobiology, but you two defy all conventional understanding. You’re living proof that life is diverse and endlessly surprising.” Gloopy and Glitter exchanged a look, a silent communication passing between them. “You know,” Glitter said, “Maybe we can teach you a thing or two about life beyond what is known on Earth.” The traveler’s eyes sparkled with the promise of knowledge yet undiscovered. “I’d like that very much,” he said, his perspective on life broader than ever before. “It would be an honor to learn from you both.” As the suns set on the horizon, casting an array of colorful hues across the sky, the trio settled down for what would be the first of many discussions about the vast complexities and beauties of the universe. Together, they explored the profound mysteries of life, becoming ambassadors of their respective worlds, and friends who would share wonders beyond imagination. Write a story where they ask the scientist if there are anyone like them on other planet Gloopy and Glitter had always been curious about the vast expanse of the cosmos and whether there were other beings like them scattered across different worlds. Their inquisitive natures led them to seek out the wisdom of a renowned interstellar scientist, Dr. Lysara, who specialized in xenobiology and the study of extraterrestrial life forms. They found Dr. Lysara in her laboratory, tucked away on a space station that orbited a vibrant nebula, a place teeming with scientific discovery and intergalactic study. The laboratory was filled with holographic projections of different planets and life forms, and the air hummed with data streams from her field explorations. “Dr. Lysara,” Glitter began, her sparkling form catching the ambient light, “we have traveled across the stars to ask you a question that burns within us.” Dr. Lysara, a human-like being with skin the color of twilight and eyes that shone like binary stars, turned to the pair with interest. “And what question is that, my iridescent friends?” Gloopy reshaped his form into something resembling a chair and settled himself comfortably. “We wonder,” he said, “are there others like us out there? Beings made of slime or similar substances? Have your explorations revealed creatures who are malleable, like me, or sparkling, like Glitter?” The scientist’s eyes gleamed with a mixture of excitement and thoughtfulness as she listened to their query. She walked over to her terminal, her fingers gliding across a control panel that activated a three-dimensional galactic map. “Your question is both profound and intriguing,” Dr. Lysara replied, her voice echoing softly in the high-ceilinged room. “The universe is vast and filled with wonders, and my research has indeed uncovered a plethora of life forms with unique compositions.” She tapped on the holographic interface, and images of various planets and organisms began to float in the air around them. “Here,” she pointed to a translucent, floating entity, “is the Paramist of Nebulon IV, creatures of gas and softly glowing membranes that drift through their planet’s upper atmosphere.” Another tap brought forth a new image, this one of a thick, viscous creature that seemed to be nothing but a rolling mass of liquid. “And this,” she continued, “is a Sylopod from the oceanic world of Aquarion Prime. Much like you, Gloopy, they possess the ability to change shape and consist of a gelatinous substance.” Glitter’s eyes shone with delight as she moved closer to the holograms, studying them intently. “They are wonderful,” she murmured, “but do they have my shine, my sparkle?” Dr. Lysara smiled, anticipating the question. With another swipe of her hand across the panel, an image appeared of a creature covered in shimmering scales that reflected the light of its binary suns. “While not exactly like you, these creatures from Cygara II share your gift for radiance. They communicate through pulses of light from their scintillating scales.” Eager to learn more, Gloopy and Glitter listened to Dr. Lysara as she described the diversity of life in the universe, each story revealing more about the extraordinary inhabitants of distant worlds. It was a comforting confirmation that, in the vastness of the cosmos, there was room for all manner of existence. The meeting with Dr. Lysara left Gloopy and Glitter with a renewed sense of wonder and belonging. While they might be unique in their exact composition, they were connected to a wider community of extraordinary beings across the universe—all of whom contributed to the beautiful tapestry of cosmic life. And as they left the laboratory, their minds ablaze with thoughts of their newfound interstellar kin, Gloopy and Glitter returned to their spaceship more determined than ever to continue their adventures, seeking out new friends and knowledge among the stars. It appears that your message is empty. How may I assist you today? If you have any questions or need information on a topic, feel free to ask! Write a story where they meet a Sylopod In the vast tapestry of the cosmos, Gloopy and Glitter traversed the celestial highways in search of kindred spirits, alien creatures who, like them, defied the conventional boundaries of life forms. Their journey took them to Aquarion Prime, a planet renowned for its expansive oceans and the mysterious beings that dwelled within its depths. Upon arriving at the planet, enveloped by the serene blue of Aquarion Prime’s waters, Gloopy and Glitter decided to explore the oceanic world. Glitter twinkled with excitement, her fuschia hue shimmering against the tranquil backdrop of the water world. They undulated gracefully through the aquatic environment, Gloopy’s teal body adapting effortlessly to the fluid nature of the planet, changing his shape to navigate the currents. Glitter, ever effervescent, trailed sparkling bubbles behind her as she moved. It wasn’t long before they encountered a local inhabitant, a Sylopod as Dr. Lysara had described. The creature appeared as a rolling mass of gelatinous substance, constantly shifting its shape as it roamed the liquid landscape of its home planet. Its body was a brilliant turquoise shade, not unlike Gloopy’s own, and it moved with a flowing elegance that captivated the pair. “Greetings, noble traveler of the waters!” Gloopy called out, hailing the creature in the most cordial tone his gelatinous voice could muster. The Sylopod paused its perpetual motion, the undulations of its body slowing as it regarded the two newcomers with curiosity. It did not possess eyes or a face as they understood, but it was clear that the creature was aware of their presence. “We are explorers from far afield, on a quest to meet others like ourselves,” Glitter explained, projecting warmth and friendliness. “May we know more about you and your kind?” In response, the Sylopod began to pulsate rhythmically, sending out gentle waves that resonated through the water. Gloopy and Glitter soon realized that this was the Sylopod’s way of communicating. The vibrations carried intricate patterns and subtle nuances—a language of movement and gesture. Glitter, who was naturally attuned to the vibrations through her own sparkling form, began to interpret the movements. “It says that they are the Sylopods, the dancers of the tides, who shape the seabed with their movements and speak through the waves,” she relayed to Gloopy. The Sylopod continued to pulse, and as understanding bloomed, Gloopy and Glitter joined in the aquatic dance. Gloopy extended parts of his body, bending and twisting to mimic the Sylopod’s fluidity, while Glitter’s radiance flickered in tune to the rhythms of the ocean. Through shared silence and movement, an exchange of stories ensued. The Sylopod’s undulations told tales of ancient civilizations buried beneath the sea and of starlit nights where the ocean’s surface mirrored the heavens above. Gloopy and Glitter, in turn, shared their adventures across the stars and their desire to connect with beings of all walks of life. As they danced, they became fellow travelers in spirit, united by the universal bond of empathy and curiosity that transcends language and form. The encounter with the Sylopod enriched Gloopy and Glitter’s understanding of life’s diversity and the myriad ways in which beings could exist and express themselves. With heartfelt gestures of gratitude and friendship, Gloopy and Glitter bid the Sylopod farewell, their hearts swelling with the joy of a new connection made. They continued on their journey, eager for the next encounter and the stories it would bring, their resolve to embrace the unknown as boundless as the seas of Aquarion Prime. Write a story where the scientist organises a meeting of amorphous, gelatinous creatures like Gloopy, Hi Hello! How can I help you today? Is there a topic you’re interested in or a question I can answer for you? Hi Greetings! How may I assist you today? If you have any questions or topics you’d like to learn about, feel free to share them, and I’ll do my best to help. Write the story I asked for Certainly! Apologies for the oversight. Here’s your story. — In the heart of the Andromeda Galaxy, Dr. Lysara, the interstellar scientist with a passion for xenobiology, had a vision: a grand assembly of the galaxy’s most extraordinary amorphous and gelatinous life forms. Gloopy, with his unique ability to shape-shift, was at the center of this vision. The meeting was to be held on a neutral space station, a hub of multicultural and multi-species research, chosen for its state-of-the-art facilities that could accommodate various environmental requirements. Dr. Lysara sent out the invitations, encoded in a spectrum of frequencies and languages, ensuring that they reached every corner of known space where such creatures might reside. When Gloopy received the invitation, he buzzed with excitement. “Glitter, look! We’ve been invited to a gathering of beings just like me!” he exclaimed. Glitter’s sparkle intensified, thrilled at the prospect of meeting others with similar constitutions to her best friend. “This is going to be fascinating, Gloopy! We must go!” As they approached the space station, it was already abuzz with activity. The hangar held a myriad of ships, pods, and other forms of interstellar transportation. Inside, the air was teeming with anticipation, as creatures of all shapes and textures floated, slid, and bounced throughout the venue. Dr. Lysara greeted them personally. “Welcome, Gloopy, Glitter,” she said warmly. “I’m delighted that you could be here among your peers.” The venue was vast, with sections of the room catering to different environmental needs. There were pools for aquatic life, dry zones for more viscous beings, and humid areas for those who thrived in moisture. The temperature, lighting, and even the gravity were finely tuned to ensure comfort for all guests. As Gloopy and Glitter mingled, they met an astonishing variety of entities. There was the Sli’therin from a moon of Jupiter, whose body could split and recombine at will. They encountered Blorbs from the depths of Sigma Draconis, who communicated by changing colors and emitting soft phosphorescent glows. A particularly memorable introduction was with the Jelloxians, a group of emerald-shaded, communal-minded beings who could connect together to form larger structures, sharing thoughts and experiences fluidly among themselves. Each species shared a unique story of their evolution, their culture, and how they adapted to their respective environments. They discussed the struggles they faced upon encountering beings with more rigid body structures who often misunderstood their fluid nature. Gloopy and Glitter told tales of their travels and the friends they had made, reinforcing the idea that diversity among life forms is a strength and not a weakness. Throughout the meeting, Dr. Lysara took notes, her eyes gleaming with the excitement of a child as her own understanding of the galaxy’s life forms expanded exponentially. “This assembly is more than just a social gathering; it’s a milestone for interspecies understanding and acceptance,” she said during her closing speech. As the event came to a close, the attendees agreed to keep the channels of communication open, forging what would become a network of amorphous and gelatinous entities. It would be a repository of knowledge, a support system, and most importantly, a testament to the power of shared existence and mutual respect. Gloopy and Glitter left the meeting with a sense of pride and a deeper appreciation for their own unique forms. They had become a part of something much larger than themselves—a cosmic community of malleable marvels, each with their story woven into the beautiful tapestry of life’s rich tapestry across the stars. Write a story where they go to that Jupiter moon and see the creature for themselves The excitement was palpable as Gloopy and Glitter set course for Jupiter’s moon, a place they had learned about during the grand assembly organized by Dr. Lysara. They had been fascinated by tales of the Sli’therin, mysterious creatures who could split and recombine with apparent ease, and were eager to witness such phenomena for themselves. As their spacecraft entered Jupiter’s gravitational pull, they were treated to a spectacular view of the gas giant, its swirling storms and iconic Great Red Spot commanding awe and respect. They circled around to the lesser-known moon, which shimmered with a haunting glow, thanks to the reflected light from Jupiter’s immense presence. This was to be their destination. Upon landing, Gloopy and Glitter were greeted by a host member of the Sli’therin, who had welcomed them from the assembly via interstellar communications. The creature appeared like a fluctuating river of deep blue, with hints of silver that reflected the ambient light of the cavernous terrain they occupied. “Welcome, friends from afar,” the Sli’therin host communicated through vibrations, its fluid form undulating with each pulse of sound. “We are honored to have you explore our home.” Gloopy responded, reshaping his form to mimic courtesy in Sli’therin fashion, “We are the ones honored by your invitation. We look forward to learning about your ways.” Glitter, shimmering ever so brightly in the lesser light of the moon, added, “Your ability to split and recombine is truly wondrous. We’re eager to witness it ourselves.” The Sli’therin host began to guide them across the surface of the moon, with Gloopy and Glitter following curiously. The landscape was a mix of craggy rocks and ice, with pockets of bioluminescent flora casting a soft, ethereal light on the moon’s surface. Soon, they arrived at a vast, open space where many Sli’therins were gathered. “Gaze upon our community,” the host gestured. Before their eyes, the Sli’therins performed what could only be described as an exquisite ballet. Individual beings flowed together, merging into larger, communal forms before splitting apart again, each division a dance of intricate beauty. “The Sli’therin are singular and plural all at once,” the host explained. “We share knowledge, memories, and experiences among ourselves. This ability has helped us to survive and thrive in environments that others might find untenable.” Gloopy, intrigued, asked, “May I try to merge with you, to share an experience of understanding?” The Sli’therin host responded with an affirmative ripple. Approaching Gloopy, the Sli’therin flowed around him, and the two entities momentarily became one. Amidst this communion, Gloopy was overcome with a myriad of thoughts and emotions, not all his own—a feeling of connectedness unparalleled by anything he had ever experienced. When the Sli’therin retracted, leaving Gloopy once again distinct, he reformed slowly, visibly moved by the experience. “That was… profound,” Gloopy managed to shape out his words amid his fluctuating form. Glitter, observing the metamorphosis and exchange of existential essence, felt a surge of longing. Although she could not merge as Gloopy had, the unity and understanding demonstrated by the Sli’therin resonated deeply within her. The visit continued with the Sli’therin showcasing their ability to adapt and transform to tackle numerous challenges on their moon—a testament to the ingenuity of their species. Gloopy and Glitter witnessed the collaborative construction of shelters and storage facilities, each structure as fluid and functional as its builders. As the time came for Gloopy and Glitter to depart, their hearts and minds were brimming with new insights. The dance of the Sli’therin was etched into their memories, as was the feeling of oneness Gloopy had shared with the host. “Thank you for this gift of knowledge,” Glitter said, casting a radiant glow on their new friends. “We will carry the lessons of your unity and resilience with us,” Gloopy added, his form solidifying with renewed purpose. With heartfelt goodbyes exchanged, Gloopy and Glitter took to the stars once more, the moon of Jupiter diminishing in the distance behind them. Their adventure had been one of discovery and connection, a reminder that the cosmos was vast, but even its most elusive mysteries could be touched by the bond of shared understanding and friendship. Write about the Sli,therin’s appearance The Sli’therin were inhabitants of a lesser-known moon orbiting the gas giant Jupiter, a species of remarkable fluidity and harmony. From a distance, a Sli’therin might appear as a serene stream of liquid, imbued with the deep blue hue of the midnight ocean with hints of silver that captured and reflected any sliver of light that reached the moon’s surface. These colors provided a natural camouflage against the icy and rock-strewn landscapes they called home. Up close, one could see that the Sli’therin’s body was a constantly shifting tapestry of patterns and textures. Their form resembled terrestrial liquid but with a viscosity and coherency that betrayed a more complex biological makeup. The silvery flecks within their substance twinkled like stars, an effect that became more pronounced when they moved or communicated. They lacked traditional features such as eyes, ears, or mouths. Instead, the Sli’therin’s entire form was a sensory organ, capable of perceiving their environment in exquisite detail. Their means of communication was primarily through vibrations, which sent ripples across their bodies. These ripples were not random but highly patterned, allowing for a rich exchange of ideas and emotions through a kind of kinesthetic language. The Sli’therin had the astonishing ability to split and merge at will—a characteristic that defined their unique physiology. When they chose to divide, their body would undulate and form a crease down the middle, gradually deepening until two new, fully functional Sli’therins emerged from the division. The process was smooth and seemed effortless, reflecting a sophisticated biological control over their own molecular cohesion. Conversely, when the Sli’therin merged, they did so with a grace that was almost ceremonial. It was an intimate act, with two or more beings flowing into each other, their boundaries dissolving until they became a larger, communal entity. In this state, they would share collective consciousness and experiences—a form of social communion that strengthened their bonds and allowed them to exist as both individuals and as an interconnected community. The fusion of several Sli’therins created a more massive form that managed to retain the elegance of the single beings. Together, they could create complex structures or solve problems that were challenging for an individual. The temporary unions were strategic, formed for social, survival, or constructive purposes, and once their goal was reached, they would seamlessly split back into independent Sli’therins. The Sli’therin’s remarkable qualities made them one of the most fascinating species in the cosmos. Observers often found themselves entranced by the Sli’therin’s hypnotic movements and the refined dance of their existence—a living testament to the infinite possibilities of life’s expressions within the vast universe. Write a story where they uncover a secret that could have destroyed the universe millions of years ago In the quiet expanse of the universe, amidst a sea of stars and swirling galaxies, stood Gloopy and Glitter, embarked upon an adventure that would soon reveal a secret buried in the depths of cosmic history. Their journey had taken them to a derelict space station orbiting an ancient, dying star, following a map encrypted in a mysterious artifact they had discovered on their travels. The station, a forgotten relic of an advanced civilization long extinct, hid within its core archives of knowledge and history unparalleled by any known to the current denizens of the stars. As Gloopy and Glitter ventured deeper into the station’s labyrinthine corridors, they stumbled upon a sealed chamber, its door etched with symbols that pulsed with a faint, ethereal light. Using the artifact as a key, they unlocked the chamber, revealing an archive that contained the collective wisdom and memories of civilizations that spanned back to the dawn of the universe. Among these memories, they found a harrowing tale of a force that nearly unraveled the fabric of existence itself. Millions of years ago, when the universe was still young and tumultuous, a coalition of ancient civilizations discovered the existence of an anomaly at the heart of the cosmos—a singularity not bound by the laws of physics as understood. This singularity, born from the confluence of dark energies and matter, had the potential to expand uncontrollably, devouring the universe and collapsing it into a void of nothingness. Horrified by this discovery, the coalition devised a plan to contain the anomaly. They constructed a device of unimaginable power, capable of bending the very fabric of space and time. This device would create a pocket universe, into which the anomaly could be sealed away, isolated from the rest of existence. With the combined efforts of the greatest minds and resources at their disposal, the coalition enacted their plan. The singularity was drawn into the pocket universe, successfully averting the catastrophe. But the effort cost them dearly. The strain of containing such a force tore apart the fabric of their own civilizations, leading to their eventual decline and extinction. Gloopy and Glitter listened with bated breath as the archive’s holographic projections recounted this tale, the weight of the secret they had uncovered dawning upon them. They realized the importance of this knowledge, a reminder of the dangers that lurked in the unseen corners of the universe, and the sacrifices made to preserve life and existence. Determined that the sacrifice of those ancient civilizations would not be forgotten, they copied the archive’s contents onto the artifact, intending to share this knowledge with the current leaders of the galactic community. Their hope was to ensure that the universe remained vigilant against such threats and that the unity demonstrated by the coalition could serve as an inspiration for species across the cosmos. As Gloopy and Glitter set off from the space station, the artifact in their possession pulsing with the light of a million stars, they knew they were no longer just travelers exploring the wonders of the universe. They had become keepers of its history, guardians of a secret that held the key to its continued survival. Their journey back to the heart of the civilized galaxy was filled with purpose, their resolve unshakeable. They were ready to face any challenge, knowing that the story they carried could change the course of history and ensure the safety of countless generations to come. The universe, vast and mysterious, stretched out before them, its secrets now a little less daunting, thanks to the courage and curiosity of two unlikely heroes. Write a story where they talk to each other about what they just witnessed After departing the ancient space station, Gloopy and Glitter charted a course for a quiet nebula, a place where they could reflect on the monumental discovery they had just made. The nebula, with its swirling clouds of gas and dust, bathed their spacecraft in a gentle luminescence, creating an atmosphere of calm and introspection. As they drifted through the cosmic ballet of lights and colors, Gloopy broke the silence, his voice tinged with a mix of awe and concern. “Glitter, can you believe what we just found? An entire archive of civilizations lost to time, and that secret… it’s almost too much to comprehend.” Glitter, still processing the weight of the revelation, shimmered softly, her light reflecting her thoughtful mood. “I know, Gloopy. It’s overwhelming. The thought that the universe once teetered on the brink of oblivion, and we had no idea.” Her voice trailed off, lost in the magnitude of what they had learned. Gloopy extended a tentacle-like appendage towards Glitter, a gesture of comfort. “It’s scary, but it also shows how much those before us cared about life, about preserving the future. They worked together, despite their differences, to save everything. It’s… it’s inspiring.” “Yes, it is,” Glitter agreed, her glow brightening slightly. “It makes me think about our own place in the universe. We’re just two beings among trillions, but today, we’ve become part of something so much bigger. We carry their story, their legacy.” Gloopy nodded, his form shifting as he absorbed the gravity of their conversation. “What do you think we should do with this knowledge? The danger of the singularity might be gone, but the lessons from it shouldn’t be lost.” Glitter was silent for a moment before responding, “We need to share it, Gloopy. Not to spread fear, but to foster unity. To show the current and future generations that working together, considering others’ survival as your own, is the key to safeguarding against threats, seen and unseen.” There was a pause as both contemplated the path ahead, the responsibility that lay upon their slimy and sparkly shoulders. Gloopy finally spoke, determination firm in his voice. “Then let’s make a plan. We’ll start by compiling the data in a way that’s understandable to all. Next, we can reach out to the Galactic Council. They have the means to spread this message to every corner of known space.” “And we’ll tell the story ourselves too,” added Glitter, her light pulsing with resolve. “Everywhere we go, we’ll share what we’ve learned. We’ll be ambassadors of unity, just like those ancient civilizations were.” The two friends spent hours discussing their plan, refining their message, and preparing for the journey ahead. They knew it wouldn’t be easy, that there might be those who doubted them or the importance of their discovery. But they also knew they had each other, and the wisdom of the ages behind them. As they set a course away from the nebula, heading towards the bustling lanes of interstellar civilization, Gloopy and Glitter looked out into the vast expanse of the universe. It was a place of endless mystery and potential danger, but also of boundless hope and unity. Armed with the knowledge of the past, they were ready to face the future, whatever it might hold. Write a story where a young Earth boy sees them On the outskirts of a small rural town on Earth, nestled among fields of golden wheat and under the vast canvas of the night sky, a young boy named Jake softly treaded through his backyard. His gaze was fixed upwards, marveling at the countless stars twinkling like distant lanterns. His passion for the cosmos was fueled by tales of astronauts and distant worlds, dreams that reached beyond the horizon. Unbeknownst to him, that very night, Gloopy and Glitter had veered their spacecraft towards Earth, intrigued by the blue and green jewel that stood out in the darkness of space. Their mission was one of curiosity, a friendly excursion to observe the plethora of life forms they had heard about. As Jake’s eyes roamed the heavens, a shooting star caught his attention, streaking across the sky with an unusual luminosity. The trail of light it left behind was not just white but tinged with teal and a spark of fuchsia. With a gasp of wonder, Jake watched as the “star” descended gently towards the ground, not far from where he stood. Gloopy and Glitter landed their craft in a clearing, hidden from the prying eyes of the world but not from the awe-struck boy who had followed the light. As they emerged, their forms contrasting starkly against the night, Jake stumbled upon them. In that moment, time seemed to stand still. Jake couldn’t believe his eyes. Before him stood a teal blob of slime, headphones dangling from his form, and a sparkling fuschia entity, gleaming under the moonlight. His heart raced, thoughts tumbling over themselves - could they be… aliens? Gloopy, ever perceptive of the emotions of others, noticed the boy’s apprehension and shaped his form into a friendly smile. “Hello there, young Earthling,” he said, his voice warm and inviting. “Don’t be afraid. I’m Gloopy, and this is Glitter. We come in peace.” Glitter flickered brightly, a gesture of greeting, and added, “We’re explorers, just like the astronauts you read about.” Jake took a step closer, his curiosity overcoming his initial shock. “Are… are you real aliens? From outer space?” he asked, his voice a mix of disbelief and excitement. “Yes, we are,” Gloopy replied, moving slightly closer to show he meant no harm. “We travel the stars, learning about different planets and cultures. Earth is our latest stop.” The boy was filled with a thousand questions, each one more pressing than the last. “What’s it like, traveling in space? Have you met other aliens? Can I touch you?” the questions tumbled out unchecked. Glitter laughed, a sound like the chime of bells, and nodded her consent. As Jake tentatively reached out and touched Glitter, he felt a slight tingle, a sensation like static electricity but warmer, friendlier. Gloopy allowed Jake to feel his gelatinous body, which was unlike anything he had ever imagined. For hours under the starlit sky, Gloopy and Glitter shared tales of distant worlds and cosmic wonders with Jake, each recounted adventure igniting the boy’s imagination. They spoke of the Sli’therin of Jupiter’s moons, the vast archives of lost civilizations, and the secret that almost destroyed the universe. As dawn began to color the eastern sky with hues of pink and gold, Gloopy and Glitter knew it was time to depart. Jake, filled with a newfound sense of wonder and a heart brimming with dreams of space, promised to keep their visit a secret. “We’ll always be watching over you, Jake,” Glitter said, her light dimming softly. “Remember, the universe is vast and full of friends you haven’t met yet.” With a final wave, Gloopy and Glitter boarded their spacecraft, which quietly lifted off, leaving behind a trail of teal and fuschia against the morning sky. Jake stood there for a long time, watching until they were no more than a twinkling star vanishing on the horizon. He knew his life was forever changed. With a heart full of dreams and a head full of stars, he made a silent vow to explore the cosmos, just like his new friends. And so, under the watchful eyes of Gloopy and Glitter from afar, Jake grew to pursue a life dedicated to the stars, always cherishing that magical encounter that had shown him the universe was not just a place of boundless mysteries, but of unparalleled friendship. Write a diary entry from him about Gloopy Diary Entry - August 15 Today was the most extraordinary day of my life. It started off like any other summer night. I was in the backyard, lying on the grass, gazing up at the stars. The sky was clear, and the stars were shining brighter than ever. I’ve always been fascinated by space, dreaming of distant galaxies and what secrets they hold. Little did I know, tonight, part of those dreams would come true. As I was watching, a shooting star – or so I thought – caught my attention. Unlike any shooting star I’ve ever seen, this one was glowing with a strange teal and fuschia light. I squinted, unbelieving, as it seemed to descend toward the earth, not far from where I was. Driven by a mix of curiosity and a touch of recklessness that I didn’t know I possessed, I followed the light. In a clearing not too far away, I found something that would forever change my view of the universe. There, standing before me, were two beings from another world. I rubbed my eyes, thinking it was all a dream. But no, they were real. The first, who introduced himself as Gloopy, was unlike anything I could have imagined. He was a blob of slime, but not gross or scary. Instead, he was… friendly, with a form that shifted and changed even as he spoke, headphones casually draped around him. His voice was warm, almost comforting, making me forget for a moment that I was talking to an alien. Gloopy told me about his travels across the stars, about the wonders he’d seen and the friends he’d made. He spoke of galaxies where the stars sing to each other, of planets painted in colors no human eye has ever seen, and of the unity and diversity of life throughout the cosmos. His words painted pictures in my mind, vivid and alive, filling me with an insatiable hunger for knowledge and exploration. But Gloopy was more than just tales of distant worlds. He was a reminder, a symbol of the vast and beautiful universe that lies beyond our blue skies. A universe where beings like him – a teal blob of sentient slime – can exist and be a friend to a boy from Earth. Gloopy, with his gentle demeanor and easy laugh, taught me that life, in any form, is a remarkable gift, and that the universe is far more diverse and wondrous than I could have ever imagined. As I write this, the memory of Gloopy’s form, shimmering under the moonlight, is etched in my mind. I feel changed, like a door has been opened to a world I only dared to dream of. Gloopy may have gone back to the stars, but he’s left behind a spark, a burning desire in my heart to learn, to explore, and perhaps, one day, to traverse the infinite reaches of space myself. I don’t know what the future holds, but one thing is certain: I will never forget Gloopy, my friend from the stars. His visit has turned an ordinary summer night into a memory I will cherish for the rest of my life, a reminder that the universe is filled with endless possibilities and friendships waiting to be discovered. Until we meet again, Gloopy. -Jake Write a diary entry from him describing his appearance, his cartoon looking eyes being his only facial feature, and how he can talk with no mouth Diary Entry - August 16 Today has been another day of reflection, and I have been filled with endless thoughts about Gloopy, my extraordinary friend from beyond the stars. There’s so much about him that feels like it belongs in the pages of a science fiction story, yet he’s as real as the stars in the night sky. One of the most remarkable things about Gloopy is his appearance. He doesn’t look like any creature I’ve ever seen or even imagined. He’s a blob – yes, a blob – but not the kind you’d expect to find in a pond or under a rock. He’s made of this vibrant teal slime that seems to capture and reflect the light in the most mesmerizing way. It’s like he’s made of the very essence of the cosmos. But what really stands out are his eyes. Gloopy has these cartoon-like eyes that float in his gelatinous form. They’re the only facial feature he has, and they do so much to express how he’s feeling. Those eyes can convey a whole range of emotions – joy, curiosity, amusement, empathy. It’s remarkable how much personality comes through, just from those expressive, floating eyes. Watching them, you forget that he doesn’t have a face in the traditional sense. And then there’s the fact that he can talk without a mouth. At first, it was the most baffling thing to observe. His voice just seems to emanate from his being, clear and warm. The sound doesn’t come from any specific part of him – it’s like it’s projected directly into the air. It’s fascinating to hear him speak; his tales of interstellar adventures and cosmic wonders are all the more enchanting for it. Despite not having a mouth, Gloopy’s laughter is contagious. It bubbles up from within him, quite literally, and it’s almost impossible not to join in. It’s a sound filled with such genuine mirth that it lights up everything around him. I find myself reflecting on how communication goes beyond the simple act of moving a mouth or forming words. Gloopy, with no mouth to speak of, conveys so much through his tone, his “facial” expressions, and his body language. It’s a testament to the universal nature of communication, a reminder that the desire to connect and share transcends all boundaries - even intergalactic ones. In a way, Gloopy challenges all preconceived notions of what life can be. He’s a being from a world vastly different from our own, yet we could talk and laugh as if we’d known each other for years. It’s a poignant reminder of the diversity that exists in the universe, and the common threads that tie all sentient beings together. As I sat under the stars tonight, I found myself wondering about the countless other forms of life that might be out there, each with their unique ways of existing and communicating. My encounter with Gloopy has opened my eyes and heart to endless possibilities. And so, as I close today’s entry, I am filled with gratitude for having met Gloopy. He’s not just an alien from a distant world – he’s a friend who has shown me the infinite diversity and beauty of the universe. Until next time, JakeGiven the unique nature of Gloopy’s species, their digestion process is quite fascinating and unlike anything found in more conventional, Earth-based life forms. Gloopy belongs to a species of amorphous, gelatinous beings who do not have a digestive system in the way humans or animals do. Here’s how Gloopy’s species, the Gloopians, handle the process of digestion: Absorption: Instead of ingesting food through a mouth and breaking it down in a stomach, Gloopians absorb nutrients directly through their skin. They envelop the nutrient source with their body, allowing the nutrients to be absorbed into their gelatinous form. This process is highly efficient, leaving little to no waste behind. Selective Permeability: The outer layer of a Gloopian’s body is selectively permeable, meaning it can control what passes through into the inner layers. This allows Gloopians, like Gloopy, to absorb beneficial nutrients while keeping out harmful substances. It’s a sophisticated biological filter that ensures their survival in various environments. Nutrient Distribution: Once absorbed, the nutrients are distributed throughout their body by a network of channels within their gelatinous mass. These channels function similarly to a circulatory system, ensuring that every part of their body gets the needed nutrients to function and maintain their structural integrity. Metabolic Conversion: Gloopians convert absorbed nutrients into energy through a process similar to cellular respiration but without the need for a respiratory system. This metabolic process is performed by specialized cells scattered throughout their body. These cells can break down the nutrients at a molecular level, extracting energy in a highly efficient manner. Regeneration and Growth: The energy and raw materials obtained from the absorbed nutrients aren’t just used for day-to-day activities but also play a crucial role in Gloopians’ ability to change shape, regenerate lost parts, and grow. Unlike most Earth-based life forms, which have specialized organs for these tasks, Gloopians rely on the versatile nature of their gelatinous bodies to perform these functions. Waste Excretion: Given the efficiency of their absorption and metabolic processes, Gloopians produce minimal waste. Any unneeded or harmful substances are expelled from their body through a process of excretion, where parts of their gelatinous form push the waste out, much like sweating or secretion. This process is very controlled and can happen from any part of their body. Communication and Sensation: Interestingly, their digestive process also has a role in how they perceive and interact with their environment. By absorbing various substances, they can “taste” and “smell” their surroundings, aiding in communication and environmental awareness. This sensory absorption informs them about the nutritional value of potential food sources and the presence of possible toxins or dangers. Gloopy’s species showcases the incredible adaptability and efficiency that life can achieve, offering a window into the diverse ways life can evolve to meet the challenges of survival in the vast universe. Write about their species appearance, they usually come in different colours The Gloopians, an extraterrestrial species of which Gloopy is a notable member, are distinguished by their malleable, gelatinous bodies that thrive in a kaleidoscope of colors, each individual shimmering with its unique hue. This species doesn’t conform to any rigid structure; instead, they embody fluidity and change, making them one of the most fascinating and visually captivating beings in the cosmos. Color Variations: Each Gloopian possesses a color that is as unique as their personality. From deep, oceanic blues and vibrant greens to radiant purples, soft pinks, and even iridescent multi-colors that seem to change depending on the angle of light, the spectrum of their appearance is nearly limitless. Gloopy, for instance, has a teal appearance, while others like his best friend, Glitter, exhibit a sparkling fuschia. Luminosity and Texture: Their bodies can emit a soft, gentle glow, making them quite the sight in the darker realms of space or on their home planet during the night. This bioluminescence not only serves as a means of communication but also adds to the ethereal beauty of their species. The texture of a Gloopian’s body is smooth and semi-transparent, resembling a gel or thick liquid in constant motion. Size and Shape: Gloopians can alter their size and shape at will, stretching their bodies to mimic forms or simply expand for the purpose of communication or interaction. Despite these changes, they maintain a coherent mass, with their core appearing denser and more vibrant in color. This ability to shape-shift allows them to adapt to a variety of situations, communicate non-verbally by forming symbols or emulating objects, and even express emotions. Eyes: The most stable feature of a Gloopian are their eyes, which float within their gelatinous bodies. These cartoon-like eyes are capable of expressing a wide range of emotions, serving as the primary means through which they interact with the world and each other. Despite their constantly changing forms, the eyes remain a constant, grounding aspect of their identity. No Fixed Extremities: Lacking fixed extremities such as arms or legs, Gloopians can generate temporary appendages from their mass to interact with their environment or manipulate objects. These appendages can take any form necessary—ranging from tentacle-like extensions for exploration to more hand-like structures for delicate tasks—and dissipate back into their body when no longer required. Adaptability: This species’ appearance is not just a visual marvel but a testament to their incredible adaptability and resilience. Their bodies can withstand extreme conditions, from the vacuum of space to the pressures of deep-sea worlds, making them adept explorers of the unknown reaches of the galaxy. The Gloopians represent a celebration of diversity and fluidity, both in appearance and in essence. Their ability to change and adapt, coupled with the vivid individuality expressed through their colors and luminosity, sets them apart as a truly unique species in the universe. Gloopy, with his teal hue and adventurous spirit, is a perfect ambassador for the beauty and complexity of his kind. Write how famous this species is in the galaxy In the sprawling tapestry of the galaxy, where stars are born and civilizations rise and fall, the Gloopians have carved out a unique niche for themselves, becoming one of the most renowned species among the cosmic community. Their fame doesn’t stem from dominion over vast swathes of space or from possessing advanced technological weaponry, but rather from their unparalleled adaptability, peaceful nature, and the rich cultural exchanges they facilitate across the stars. Diplomacy and Peacekeeping: The Gloopians are renowned for their roles as diplomats and peacekeepers. Their innate ability to shape-shift allows them to present themselves in forms that are pleasing or familiar to other species, easing communication and understanding. This, coupled with their empathetic nature, has made them invaluable in negotiating peace across divided sectors and mediating disputes between conflicting alien races. Many galactic councils and alliances hold Gloopians in high esteem for their contributions to maintaining harmony and balance. Exploration and Discovery: As natural explorers, Gloopians have ventured into uncharted territories that many other species find inhospitable or perilous. Their adaptability allows them to survive in extreme environments, from the cold void of space to the molten surfaces of uninhabitable planets. Their discoveries, ranging from new life forms to ancient artifacts of long-gone civilizations, have significantly expanded the collective knowledge of the galaxy. Each new revelation shared by the Gloopians opens up possibilities for scientific advancement and further exploration. Cultural Exchanges: Gloopians are also celebrated for their enthusiastic participation in cultural exchanges. They travel from world to world, not only to explore but to learn and share. They introduce other civilizations to the vast cultural heritage of the galaxy, including art, music, and philosophy. This has fostered a deeper understanding among different species, bridging gaps and building a shared sense of community among the stars. The Gloopian’s colorful presence is a staple at galactic gatherings, where they often mesmerize attendees with displays of their shape-shifting abilities and the luminous beauty of their forms. Interstellar Tourism: The homeworld of the Gloopians, a planet dazzling with bioluminescent flora and fauna, has become a prime destination for interstellar tourism. Visitors are drawn not only to the natural wonders but also to the warm hospitality of the Gloopians, who are eager to share their way of life with others. This has made their planet a hub for cultural festivals, academic symposiums, and diplomatic summits, further cementing the Gloopians’ reputation as gracious hosts and proponents of interstellar unity. Gloopian Ambassadors: Perhaps the most endearing aspect of the Gloopians’ fame is their widespread presence as ambassadors and representatives throughout the galaxy. Individuals like Gloopy become known far and wide for their adventures and the friendships they forge along the way. These stories, often shared across various media, contribute to the mystique and allure of the Gloopian species, showcasing their curiosity, bravery, and kind spirit. In a galaxy where differences can often lead to conflict, the Gloopians stand as a beacon of unity and cooperation. Their fame extends beyond their unique physical attributes, highlighting their contributions to the galactic community and their unwavering commitment to exploring the unknown, understanding the myriad forms of life that share the cosmos, and bringing them closer together in the vast expanse of space. Write a story where a human travels by space plane to holiday in Gloopiter In the year 2378, space travel had evolved from the fledgling attempts of the previous centuries to a streamlined, commonplace aspect of human life. The edges of the known universe seemed to draw ever closer with each technological leap forward. Among the myriad destinations that beckoned to the intrepid and the curious, one stood out for its unique charm and the warm hospitality of its inhabitants: Gloopiter, the homeworld of the Gloopians. Carter Jensen, a school teacher from Earth with a passion for extraterrestrial cultures, had saved up for years for the opportunity to explore the corners of the galaxy. When the holiday season approached, he knew exactly where he wanted to go. The stories of Gloopiter’s bioluminescent landscapes and its amorphous, friendly inhabitants had captured his imagination ever since he first read about them in an interstellar travel guide. He booked his passage on the Celestial Express, a state-of-the-art space plane known for its luxurious accommodations and scenic routes through the galaxy. The journey to Gloopiter was as breathtaking as promised, with views of nebulae, asteroid fields sparkling like diamonds in the void, and the majestic dance of distant galaxies. Upon arrival, Carter was greeted by Gloopy himself, who had become somewhat of a legend among Earth’s populace for his adventures and the friendships he had forged with humans. Gloopy’s teal form shimmered in the sunlight of Gloopiter’s twin stars, his cartoon-like eyes expressing a warm welcome that immediately put Carter at ease. “Welcome to Gloopiter, Carter Jensen!” Gloopy exclaimed in his bubbly, resonant voice. “We are overjoyed to share the wonders of our world with you.” Gloopiter was unlike any place Carter had ever imagined. The ground beneath his feet was spongy and seemed to gently pulse with life. Towering trees with translucent leaves emitted a soft glow, bathing the landscape in ethereal light. Rivers of liquid crystal flowed through the forests, their banks lined with creatures that sparkled like living jewels. Gloopy took Carter on a tour, showing him the cities of Gloopiter, where architecture was not built but grown, and where each building merged seamlessly with the natural landscape. They visited the Great Hall of Gloopiter, a massive, dome-like structure where the walls continuously shifted colors and patterns, reflecting the collective mood and thoughts of the Gloopian citizens within. Carter was introduced to the art of Gloopian cuisine, a sensory experience that defied explanation. The food, if it could be called such, was an assortment of globules and strands that floated around the table. Each bite offered a burst of flavors and sensations that Carter had never encountered, a testament to the Gloopians’ mastery of molecular gastronomy. The highlight of the trip, however, was the Festival of Lights, an event that coincided with Carter’s visit. Gloopians from all over the planet gathered to celebrate the harmony of life in the galaxy. They shared stories, sang songs that resonated through the very ground, and performed a dance of forms, where they shape-shifted in a mesmerizing display of light and color. As Carter stood among the Gloopians, witnessing the beauty and unity of their culture, he felt a profound sense of belonging. Despite the differences between their species, he realized that at their core, all beings sought the same things: connection, understanding, and peace. When the time came for Carter to return to Earth, he felt a pang of sadness. Gloopiter had become more than just a holiday destination; it was a reminder of the vast, wondrous diversity of the universe, and of the friendships that could transcend the boundaries of space and form. Gloopy saw him off at the spaceport, his eyes conveying a depth of emotion that words could not capture. “You will always have a home here on Gloopiter, my friend,” Gloopy said. “May the stars guide you safely until we meet again.” As the Celestial Express soared back into the cosmos, Carter looked out at the receding planet, its glow fading into the distance. He knew he would return someday, but until then, he carried with him the memories of Gloopiter — a beacon of light in the infinite expanse, a testament to the beauty of unity in diversity. Write a news article that same year titled “Goodbye Germany, So Long Spain” saying humans are abandoning traditional vacations (except Disney because let’s be real, who would ever stop going there) in favor of vacationing on other planets, and say the most popular as of May 2378 Goodbye Germany, So Long Spain: Intergalactic Travel Ushers in a New Era of Vacationing May 2378 In a trend that is reshaping the landscape of tourism and leisure, humans are increasingly turning their backs on Earth’s traditional vacation spots in favor of more exotic locales — not across countries, but across the cosmos. From the crimson dunes of Mars to the floating gardens of Neptune, interstellar travel has become the new norm for holiday-goers seeking adventure beyond Earth’s atmosphere. The allure of otherworldly landscapes, alien cultures, and the thrill of space travel has led to a significant shift in vacation planning for many, leaving classic destinations in the proverbial dust. However, it’s worth noting that one Earth-based destination has held its ground amidst this cosmic shift: Disney World, because let’s be real, who would ever stop going there? As of May 2378, reports from the Galactic Travel Bureau indicate that traditional vacation spots like Germany’s Black Forest and Spain’s sunny beaches have seen a notable decline in Earthling visitors. In contrast, bookings for interplanetary travel have skyrocketed, with the travel industry adapting rapidly to accommodate the growing demand for off-planet experiences. The Shift to Space Tourism The shift towards space tourism isn’t just about novelty and exploring the unknown; it’s emblematic of humanity’s ever-expanding curiosity and our innate desire to connect with the cosmos. Innovations in space travel technology have made what was once a dream for many — vacationing among the stars — an accessible and appealing reality. “With the advances in spaceflight safety and comfort, the galaxy is literally at our fingertips,” says Lyra Mendez, CEO of Nova Horizons, a leading space tourism company. “We are at the dawn of a new era where vacationing on another planet is as easy as taking a trip to another country used to be.” Gloopiter: The Top New Destination Leading the pack of new vacation hotspots is Gloopiter, the homeworld of the friendly and fascinating Gloopians. Renowned for its bioluminescent flora, breathtaking landscapes, and the unique culture of its gelatinous inhabitants, Gloopiter offers an experience that can’t be found anywhere on Earth. “Gloopiter’s popularity among Earth tourists is unprecedented,” states Mendez. “Its appeal lies not just in its natural beauty, but in the warmth and hospitality of the Gloopians, who are eager to share their world with us. It’s a place where you truly feel connected to the universe.” This trend isn’t confined to Gloopiter alone; vacations to the crystalline caves of Saturn’s moon Titan and the underwater cities of Europa are quickly rising in popularity, offering experiences as diverse as the galaxy itself. Earth Destinations Feel the Impact As space tourism takes off, traditional Earth vacation spots are feeling the impact. In response, many are finding innovative ways to incorporate aspects of space and science fiction into their attractions, hoping to recapture the imagination of would-be travelers. Despite these efforts, the pull of the cosmos remains strong. “For me, the choice was simple,” says Anika Patel, a recent visitor to Gloopiter. “Why spend a week on a beach when I could be exploring alien worlds and experiencing culture and sights no Earth destination can offer?” The Enduring Charm of Disney Yet, in this brave new world of interstellar exploration, Disney World has retained its magical appeal, proving that some Earthly experiences are timeless. Families and individuals alike continue to flock to the park, drawn by the allure of its storytelling, nostalgia, and the unmistakable magic that no other planet can replicate. “No matter where I travel in the galaxy, Disney will always be a destination for my family,” says Patel. “It’s a different kind of magic, one that reminds us of home.” As humanity’s gaze turns outward, with eyes filled with wonder at the vastness and beauty of space, it seems that vacationing among the stars is not just a fleeting trend, but the beginning of a new chapter in our relationship with the universe. Goodbye, Germany. So long, Spain. The galaxy calls, and we are answering — with our vacation days. Write a news article where many Gloopiter towns now have British restaurants, bars, same with other country themed restaurants, There are lots of hotels and shops stocking Earth products, and the economy is booming, Also Gloopy says how they source the Earth food, saying they generate it using a machine Gloopiter Embraces Earth Culture as Cosmic Tourism Booms Gloopiter, May 2378 – In a fascinating case of interstellar cultural exchange, the once-quiet towns of Gloopiter are now bustling hubs of activity, featuring an ever-growing number of Earth-themed restaurants, bars, and hotels. From the full English breakfast served under the glow of bioluminescent trees to the lively beats of Samba echoing through the crystal canyons, Gloopiter has become a melting pot of Earth cultures, much to the delight of tourists and locals alike. The introduction of Earth culture to Gloopiter’s tourism landscape has not only enriched the planet’s cultural tapestry but has also led to an unprecedented economic boom. Shops stocking Earth products—from fashion and music to traditional teas and spices—are now commonplace, catering to the curiosity and nostalgia of both Earthlings and Gloopians. A Taste of Earth, Light-Years Away One of the most remarkable aspects of this cultural fusion is the authenticity of the Earth culinary experience offered on Gloopiter. British pubs serve fish and chips, Indian restaurants offer spicy curries, and Italian bistros present perfect pasta dishes—all tasting just as they would on Earth. This has raised questions about how such authentic flavors and ingredients are sourced so far from their origins. Gloopy, who has been instrumental in fostering ties between Earth and Gloopiter, shared the secret behind the authentic Earth cuisine: “We use a special machine that can generate any Earth food by rearranging molecular structures based on digitized recipes. It’s the same technology we use to adapt our bodies for space travel, now fine-tuned for culinary creation. This way, we ensure that what we offer is not just a simulation, but a real taste of Earth.” Cultural Exchange Fuels Economic Growth The influx of tourists seeking the novelty of Earth culture on Gloopiter has significantly boosted the local economy. Hotels that cater specifically to Earthlings—with gravity adjusters and atmosphere regulators to mimic Earth’s environment—are almost always fully booked. Meanwhile, Gloopian entrepreneurs are learning to brew Earth-style coffee and bake pastries, blending the best of both worlds. Cultural exchange programs are also in place, inviting Earth chefs, artists, and educators to share their knowledge and skills with the Gloopian community. This has led to a renaissance of sorts, with Earth’s music, literature, and art influencing Gloopian culture in return. Preserving Gloopian Culture Amidst Globalization While the economic and cultural benefits of this exchange are clear, there are concerns about preserving Gloopian culture amidst the wave of globalization. Gloopy addresses these concerns by emphasizing the importance of cultural exchange as a two-way street: “We welcome Earth’s cultures to enrich our world, just as we share the beauty of Gloopiter with Earth. It’s a partnership that fosters understanding and unity across the stars.” As Gloopiter continues to embrace the diversity of Earth’s cultures, it sets an example for the galaxy on the potential of mutual respect and cultural exchange. The planet that once captured the imagination of Earthlings as a vacation destination now stands as a beacon of cosmopolitanism, proving that even light-years of distance cannot dampen the human (and Gloopian) spirit of exploration and connection. Write a story where a family checks into a hotel, one worker entertains the kid by morphing In the vibrant heart of Gloopiter’s capital, nestled among trees emitting a soft, bioluminescent glow, stood the newly opened Terra Nova Resort, a marvel of intergalactic hospitality designed to cater to the whims of Earth tourists and Gloopian locals alike. It was here that the Moreno family from Earth, consisting of Alex and Jamie Moreno and their eight-year-old son, Timmy, arrived, their faces brimming with excitement and curiosity at the alien world around them. As they stepped into the grand lobby of Terra Nova, their eyes widened at the sight of the shifting walls, which changed colors softly, mimicking the serene beauty of Gloopiter’s evening sky. They were greeted warmly by the staff, but it was Zlerg, a young Gloopian concierge with a vibrant orange hue, who caught Timmy’s immediate interest. While Alex and Jamie were busy checking in and discussing excursion plans with another staff member, Zlerg noticed Timmy’s wide-eyed wonder at everything around him. Zlerg, knowing just how to engage the young Earthling’s imagination, drifted closer, their body subtly shifting and shimmering. “Hello, Timmy,” Zlerg said, their voice a soothing melody. “Would you like to see something cool?” Timmy, initially taken aback by the talking blob of orange goo, nodded eagerly, his initial apprehension replaced by curiosity. With a twinkle in their amorphous body, Zlerg began to morph. First, they stretched upward, their top half thinning and sharpening into the outline of a rocket ship – a tribute to the space voyage that brought the Morenos to Gloopiter. Timmy’s eyes went wide with delight, and a laugh bubbled up from his chest as he reached out to touch, only to have his hand pass through Zlerg’s non-solid form. Zlerg chuckled, a sound like the gentle pop of bubbles, and continued their display. Next, Zlerg transformed into a facsimile of a Gloopiterian skybeast, a majestic creature known for its gentle nature and wings that sparkled under Gloopiter’s twin suns. Timmy clapped his hands in awe, his fear entirely forgotten, as he watched the skybeast flap its wings and soar around his head in a small loop. But Zlerg wasn’t done yet. With a flourish, they morphed once more, this time into a perfect replica of Timmy, complete with a baseball cap and a grin. “Look, Timmy! It’s you!” Zlerg exclaimed, playfully mimicking Timmy’s stance and movements. Timmy burst into uncontrollable giggles, thoroughly enchanted by Zlerg’s performance. Even Alex and Jamie, having finished their check-in, turned to watch, smiles spreading across their faces at the sight of their son so joyously entertained. “That’s incredible!” Jamie exclaimed, grateful for Zlerg’s kindness and the warm welcome their family had received. “Thank you, Zlerg,” Alex added, genuinely impressed. “I think you’ve just made Timmy’s day.” As Zlerg reverted back to their original form, they bowed slightly, their body rippling with the motion. “It was my pleasure. Here on Gloopiter, we believe that joy and laughter are the universal languages of friendship. We’re so happy you’re here with us.” The Moreno family knew then that their trip to Gloopiter would be filled with wonder and whimsy beyond anything they had imagined. As they followed a staff member to their room, Timmy glanced back at Zlerg, already regaling other incoming guests with his shapeshifting tales. Timmy felt a surge of gratitude for the unforgettable welcome and the magic that laid ahead on this extraordinary planet. Write about Zlerg’s appearance Zlerg, a member of the intriguing and amorphous Gloopian species, stands as a testament to the unique and captivating beauty of his kind. Unlike beings of rigid structure, Zlerg’s form is constantly in flux, embodying the fluidity and adaptiveness that characterizes the Gloopians. At first glance, one might notice his vibrant orange hue, a color that seems to glow from within, casting a soft light around him and highlighting his cheerful disposition. Zlerg’s body, devoid of any fixed or hard parts, resembles a playful dance of gelatinous substance, capable of reshaping at will. This malleability allows him to express emotions, intentions, and even mimic forms and shapes with a level of precision and creativity that fascinates all who observe him. Despite his fluid nature, Zlerg often chooses to present himself in a form that loosely resembles a humanoid outline, a gesture of camaraderie towards the many human visitors on Gloopiter. The most mesmerizing aspect of Zlerg, however, is perhaps his eyes. Floating within his gelatinous mass, these eyes are the windows through which his kind and spirited personality shines. They sparkle with a lively twinkle, reflecting his joy and enthusiasm in engaging with others. Unlike the rest of his body, Zlerg’s eyes do not change shape or color, remaining constant beacons that convey his emotions and reactions vividly. Without a conventional mouth or nose, Zlerg communicates through vibrations that he emits, which are then translated into audible speech by the universal translators commonly used by visitors. These vibrations also allow him to express laughter, which, combined with the playful transformations of his body, makes interactions with him an unforgettable experience. Zlerg’s appearance is not just a sight to behold but also serves practical purposes. His body can stretch and extend to reach objects or navigate spaces that would be challenging for other beings. His surface is smooth to the touch, often described as holding the consistency of thick syrup, yet no residue is left behind, illustrating the peculiar, non-sticky nature of Gloopian physiology. In his role as a concierge at the Terra Nova Resort, Zlerg has become a beloved figure among guests, known for his warm welcomes and the delight he brings, especially to the youngest visitors. His ever-changing form, combined with his bright orange color, makes him a symbol of the joy and wonder that awaits visitors on Gloopiter, embodying the planet’s unique culture and the boundless possibilities of interaction that lie in a universe as diverse as it is vast. Write a news article back on Earth, where a Fuengirola bar closes, saying he can’t compete, and even admits its better, Fuengirola Bar Shuts Down: Owner Admits He Can’t Compete With Interstellar Attractions Fuengirola, Spain - In a surprising turn of events that marks the end of an era for local nightlife, the beloved Fuengirola bar “Estrella Nocturna” has officially announced its closure after decades of serving the community. The owner, Miguel Rodriguez, cited the growing trend of interstellar travel and the allure of off-world bars and experiences as the primary reasons for the establishment’s downturn in patrons. “Estrella Nocturna has been more than just a bar; it’s been a gathering place for friends, a venue for countless celebrations, and a part of Fuengirola’s soul,” Rodriguez shared with visible emotion. “However, with the rise of interstellar travel and the novelty of galactic destinations, it has become increasingly difficult to compete.” The trend Rodriguez refers to has been on the rise since the first commercial space flights made destinations like Gloopiter and Mars accessible to the average Earth citizen. Galactic travel agencies have reported record bookings, with Gloopiter, in particular, becoming a hot spot for tourists seeking an out-of-this-world experience. “It’s not just the novelty of being on another planet,” Rodriguez conceded. “The experiences they offer, like Zlerg’s shape-shifting performances at the Terra Nova Resort on Gloopiter, are something we simply can’t match here on Earth. I’ve even been there myself, and truthfully, it’s better. It’s incredible.” Rodriguez’s admission reflects a growing sentiment among Earth’s hospitality and entertainment sectors. Many small business owners are feeling the pinch as Earth’s residents look to the stars for their leisure and adventure. The sense of wonder and the immersive experiences offered by locations within our own galaxy seem to surpass even the most inventive Earth-based entertainments. Despite the challenges, Rodriguez holds no resentment toward the cosmic competition. “If anything,” he continued, “my trip to Gloopiter opened my eyes to the beauty of our galaxy and the potential it holds for all of us. It’s inspired me to think beyond the bar, perhaps even beyond Earth. Closure doesn’t have to mean the end. It can also signify a new beginning.” Rodriguez plans to host a grand farewell party for Estrella Nocturna, inviting patrons old and new to celebrate the memories made within its walls. While details of his future ventures remain closely guarded, hints suggest he may be looking to invest in creating Earth-based experiences that capture some of the galactic magic that has captivated so many. As for the residents of Fuengirola and the regulars of Estrella Nocturna, the bar’s closure serves as a poignant reminder of the changing times and the limitless possibilities that now exist beyond our planet. The future of entertainment and leisure continues to expand into the cosmos, bringing with it a sense of excitement and a thirst for discovery that transcends worlds.

From helping humans get accustomed to Gloopiter’s unique environment to his entertaining shape-shifting performances, the guy’s a legend. — QuantumJane: Absolutely agree with @CosmicTraveler88. Gloopy’s not just famous; he’s become a symbol of friendship between Gloopians and other species. His adventures with humans have been turned into children’s books, VR experiences, and even an educational series broadcast across the galaxy. — AlienAnthropologist: To add to what’s been said about Gloopy, his contributions to the Galactic Cultural Exchange Program have been monumental. He facilitated the first Earth-Gloopiter cuisine fusion restaurant, which has sparked a trend that’s sweeping across many planets. — NebulaNerd: Can’t argue with Gloopy’s fame, but let’s not forget about Zlerg, the Gloopian who became an internet sensation after that video of him morphing into various Earth and alien cultural icons went viral. Gloopy may have paved the way, but Zlerg is definitely up there too. — StarHopper42: True, @NebulaNerd. Zlerg’s been doing wonders in bringing joy and laughter across the cosmos.

Like, he’s been a part of crucial diplomatic missions and has even been awarded medals of honor from several planets for his peacekeeping efforts. — InterGalacticPeacekeeper: As someone who’s worked with Gloopy on several of those missions, I can attest to his character and influence. Beyond his fame, he’s genuinely dedicated to fostering understanding and unity among different species. His efforts go way beyond entertainment—he’s making a real difference. — GloopierNative: Speaking as a Gloopian, Gloopy is not just well-known; he’s cherished among us. His stories inspire us to be curious, brave, and compassionate. He embodies the spirit of exploration and kindness that defines our people. Plus, he always has the best travel tips! — CosmoHistorian: It’s fascinating to observe Gloopy’s rising fame from a historical perspective. He’s bridging gaps between ancient traditions and new worlds, creating a legacy that might well shape the future relations between species in the galaxy. 2379 might just be the year of Gloopy. — StarHopper42: Thanks for the insights, everyone!

Eyaie Spaceport - Where Your Galactic Adventure Begins! 🚀✨ Write a blog post on Glasgow Airport announcing that from January 1 2380, they will no longer be offering any flights to Earth destinations, saying that most of Jet2’s cabin crew are no longer human, and that it flies to other planets A New Horizon Awaits: Glasgow Airport’s Bold Leap into the Intergalactic Age As the dawn of the new year approaches, Glasgow Airport is set to embark on an unprecedented journey, signaling a significant shift in the focus of its operations. Starting January 1, 2380, the storied airport, which has long served as a gateway between Scotland and the rest of Earth, will pivot its services towards the stars, exclusively offering flights to interstellar destinations. This change, both bold and visionary, marks Glasgow Airport as a pioneer in Earth’s rapidly evolving space travel industry. The announcement comes at a time when humanity’s gaze increasingly turns upwards, seeking connection, adventure, and understanding in the vast expanse of space. Glasgow Airport’s decision to cease all Earth-bound flights is a testament to the shifting tides of travel, where distant planets and galaxies are no longer the realm of dreams and science fiction but tangible, accessible realities. Jet2: Leading the Way in Intergalactic Travel Central to this monumental shift is Jet2, the renowned airline that has been at the forefront of incorporating extraterrestrial routes into its offerings. In recent years, Jet2 has expanded its operations beyond our atmosphere, taking passengers to locations as varied as the trading hubs of Mars, the floating cities of Venus, and the serene landscapes of Gloopiter. Their commitment to exploring new frontiers is matched only by their dedication to comfort, safety, and the overall passenger experience. Interestingly, the transformation of Jet2 extends beyond its route map. The airline recently disclosed that the majority of its cabin crew are now non-human, employing a diverse array of interstellar beings. This inclusive approach not only enhances the travel experience with authentic intergalactic hospitality but also showcases Jet2’s commitment to celebrating and embracing the diversity of life in the universe. Why the Shift Away from Earth Destinations? The decision to exclusively offer interstellar flights was influenced by a variety of factors. Firstly, the demand for space travel has soared, with more Earth residents than ever before seeking to explore the cosmos. Coupled with advancements in spaceflight technology making such journeys safer, faster, and more comfortable, the allure of the stars has never been stronger. Furthermore, this shift underscores Glasgow Airport’s adaptability and forward-thinking ethos. By focusing entirely on interstellar travel, the airport positions itself as a central hub for galactic exploration, attracting visitors from across the galaxy and offering Earthlings unparalleled access to the wonders of our universe. What This Means for You For travelers looking to embark on extraterrestrial adventures, Glasgow Airport will serve as your premier launchpad. Whether you’re a seasoned spacefarer or a first-time voyager among the stars, you’ll find yourself at the heart of a vibrant network of interstellar routes designed to satiate your curiosity and wanderlust.

Glasgow’s made the big leap to full-on galactic travel (super cool, btw), but what about those of us looking for a quick jaunt to Paris or Reykjavik? Anyone got the scoop? 🌍✈️ — HighlandHopper: Last I checked, Edinburgh Airport was still operating flights across Earth destinations. They’ve definitely scaled back with all the interest shifting to the stars, but you should be able to find something for most major cities. Worth checking their latest schedule online! — SkyePilot: @HighlandHopper’s right. Edinburgh’s sticking with Earth travels for now. But, heads up, heard a rumour they might be starting some lunar shuttle services soon, so who knows how long before they follow Glasgow’s footsteps. — TravelerMcTravelFace: Honestly, with how accessible interstellar travel’s become, I’m surprised any airport’s still doing the Earth route grind. That being said, Aberdeen’s got limited services, but it’s mainly domestic and a few international spots. Pretty handy for quick trips or avoiding the spaceport crowds. — LochNessNavigator: If you’re in the north, Inverness Airport still runs a pretty busy schedule of Earth flights. It’s my go-to for hopping over to Scandinavia. Not as flashy as jetting off to another galaxy, but it gets the job done! — SpaceScot: Quick reminder for everyone - while it’s exciting to have galaxy-hopping options, Earth’s got its own kind of magic, and it’s great we can still explore it easily from Scottish airports. Plus, not everyone’s ready to take the leap to space travel yet, myself included! — GalacticGlaswegian: Missed opportunity if you ask me. Imagine if all airports went galactic. Scotland could be the interstellar travel hub of Earth! But yeah, for now, Edinburgh and a couple of others are your best bets for staying terrestrial. Always check the latest schedules, though. Things are changing faster than you can say “beam me up” these days! — CosmicWanderer101: Thanks for the insights, everyone! Looks like Earth travel isn’t totally off the table yet. Gotta admit, I’m tempted by both - a weekend in Amsterdam or a week on an alien planet? Decisions, decisions… 🌏🚀 — End of Thread Write a convo where a video is trending of a pink Gloopian tired, melted into a thick puddle","output":"Thread Title: Viral Video - Pink Gloopian Melts Into Puddle! --- PixarFan88: 🌈🌌 Have you guys seen the viral video of the pink Gloopian who got so tired they just melted into a thick, sparkly puddle?

Makes me feel a bit better about my own energy levels dropping. Link? GloopLover101: Here's the link! [ViralPinkGloopPuddle.com] It's been shared all over GalacticWeb! Never thought I'd find myself empathizing with a pool of alien goo, but here we are. 🙈💖 AstroAnthropologist: It's fascinating from a biological perspective! Gloopians usually retain their form pretty well, so seeing one just... liquify from exhaustion is rare. Shows how emotions and physical state can really affect their physiology. 🤔🔬 LazySunday: Honestly, this is peak mood. That little shimmer when they fully collapse into the puddle? Perfection. 🌟 Can someone explain how they recover? Do they just... firm up when they're rested? GloopWatcher: @LazySunday Yeah, basically! Once they rest up and regain their energy, they start to re-solidify and go back to their usual form. It's like watching a reverse melting video. Sometimes they even wake up in a completely different shape than before they melted. 😴➡️🔄 NetizenNova: I showed my non-space-faring friends, and they lost it 🤣. One of them was like, \\"Is this what intergalactic burnout looks like?\\" Now they're all into Gloopian culture. Another win for cosmic unity! StarChild: I'm just impressed by how the Gloopian community on Earth and other planets has taken the video in good spirits. Seen lots of art and memes popping up already. It's become a symbol of taking a break when you need it, no matter what galaxy you're from. ✨✍️ VisualVoyager: Just posted an animated recreation of the puddle moment. Added some uplifting music as the Gloopian starts to get their shape back. It's over on my feed for anyone needing a bit of intergalactic inspiration today! 🎶🎨 PixarFan88: Love how one small moment shared across the stars brings so many together. From laughter to life lessons, this pink Gloopian puddle video has it all. Thanks for sharing and engaging, folks!

l'échelle de Kardashev, qui mesure le progrès et la puissance d'une civilisation selon la quantité d'énergie qu'elle est capable de manipuler. Cette idée hypothétique permet de catégoriser les civilisations avancées en fonction de leur capacité technologique et énergétique. Voici comment une civilisation pourrait évoluer à travers ces niveaux et les implications potentielles dans divers domaines comme la vie, le divertissement, la santé, la nourriture et l'éducation. # Civilisation de Type I Une civilisation de type I est capable d'utiliser et de contrôler l'énergie à l'échelle de sa planète. Cela comprend l'énergie solaire, géothermique, et les autres formes renouvelables disponibles sur la planète. - **Vie et Divertissement :** Avec une maîtrise avancée des technologies, l'accès à des formes de divertissement virtuel et augmenté serait courant, offrant des expériences immersives. - **Santé :** La gestion efficace de l'énergie permettrait de développer des systèmes de santé avancés, avec des diagnostics précis grâce à l'IA et des traitements personnalisés, y compris la modification génétique pour prévenir les maladies. - **Nourriture :** La production alimentaire utiliserait des méthodes efficaces et respectueuses de l'environnement, comme l'agriculture verticale et la viande de laboratoire, minimisant ainsi l'impact écologique. - **Éducation :** L'accès universel à l'information via des technologies avancées permettrait une éducation personnalisée et adaptée aux besoins de chaque individu. # Civilisation de Type II Une civilisation de type II peut exploiter toute l'énergie disponible dans son système stellaire, souvent conceptualisée par la mégastructure hypothétique appelée sphère de Dyson. - **Vie et Divertissement :** Les voyages dans l'espace seraient courants, offrant de nouvelles expériences et formes de divertissement. La réalité virtuelle pourrait permettre de vivre des aventures dans des mondes entièrement conçus. - **Santé :** La maîtrise de la biotechnologie et la nanotechnologie permettraient la régénération des tissus et une longévité accrue, rendant possible la guérison de pratiquement toutes les maladies. - **Nourriture :** La capacité à terraformer d'autres planètes ou à construire des habitats spatiaux avec des écosystèmes contrôlés résoudrait les problèmes de pénurie alimentaire. - **Éducation :** L'apprentissage pourrait se faire par téléchargement direct de connaissances dans le cerveau, rendant l'éducation instantanée et hautement efficace. # Civilisation de Type III Une civilisation de type III pourrait exploiter l'énergie de toute une galaxie, ayant accès à des technologies et des connaissances quasi-divines. - **Vie et Divertissement :** Les possibilités seraient illimitées, avec des divertissements pouvant inclure la simulation d'univers entiers ou le voyage dans le temps, si cela s'avère possible. - **Santé :** L'immortalité et la capacité de changer de corps ou de se télécharger dans des machines pourraient être réalisées grâce à l'avancée technologique. - **Nourriture :** À ce niveau, la question de la nourriture pourrait être transcendance, peut-être remplacée par des formes d'énergie ou des processus chimiques. - **Éducation :** L'éducation pourrait impliquer une compréhension profonde de l'univers, des lois de la physique remaniées et des connaissances poussées à l'extrême. Bien entendu, ces scénarios sont purement spéculatifs et basés sur les théories et l'imagination des scientifiques et auteurs de science-fiction. Les obstacles à atteindre ces types de civilisations sont immenses, impliquant des défis technologiques, énergétiques, et socio-économiques que l'humanité est encore loin de surmonter."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Always make sure to check if an API or a more efficient bulk download method is available and adhere to the guidelines provided by the data source. For educational purposes, here's a generic way to achieve the task, assuming proper usage and compliance with the website's terms of service: 1. Install necessary packages, if you haven't already: \`\`\` pip install requests beautifulsoup4 \`\`\` 2. Use the following code snippet in your Python environment: \`\`\`python import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import pandas as pd # Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame def get_directories_from_path(url): directories = [] try: page = requests.get(url).text soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser') # Look for table rows as directory listings are generally in a table row for link in soup.find_all('a'): href = link.get('href') # Assuming directories end with '/' if href and href.endswith('/') and href not in ['../']: # Ignore parent directory links directories.append(href) except Exception as e: print(f\\"Error fetching directories for {url}: {str(e)}\\") return directories # Creating a new column 'directories' with all the directories listed in the 'path' column df['directories'] = df['path'].apply(get_directories_from_path) print(df) \`\`\` This script will add a new column to your DataFrame called 'directories', containing the list of directories extracted from each URL in your \\"path\\" column. Keep in mind that making multiple HTTP requests can be slow depending on the response time of the server and the number of URLs you are processing. To respect the server's load, consider adding a delay between requests if you're dealing with a large dataset. As mentioned earlier, it is essential to be considerate of the website's terms of service and data usage policies.

Estou bem, obrigado por perguntar. Como posso ajudar você hoje?"},{"instruction":"eu tenho um arquivo com 10 mil dados de historicos de dominios e eu gostaria de usar alguma forma a inteligencia artificial para analisar todos esses 10 mil dominios vendidos para que a IA crie pra mim uma nova lista de dominios gerados pela IA com base nas maiores vendas de dominios para que eu possa tentar comprar esses dominios gerados pela IA para eu tentar comprar para investir em dominio e tentar vender eles posteriormente. Porem não sei como vou fazer para o chat conseguir ler 10 mil dados que é muito e gerar os dominios novos. Como fazer isso?","output":"Para criar uma lista de novos domínios potencialmente valiosos usando Inteligência Artificial, baseada em uma análise de 10 mil dados de históricos de vendas de domínios, você pode seguir um processo que envolve várias etapas, incluindo pré-processamento de dados, modelagem, e possivelmente, a geração de nomes via algum modelo de linguagem. Vamos detalhar um caminho possível: # 1. Preparação e Análise dos Dados Antes de mais nada, você precisa ter um entendimento claro de seus dados. Isso inclui saber quais informações estão disponíveis para cada venda de domínio (preço, data da venda, categoria do domínio, extensão, etc.). **Pré-Processamento:** - **Limpeza de Dados:** Remova entradas duplicadas, corrija ou remova dados incorretos ou incompletos. - **Extração de Características:** Identifique as características mais importantes que podem influenciar o valor de um domínio. Isso pode incluir a extensão do domínio, o número de caracteres, se inclui palavras-chave com alto volume de busca, tendências de mercado, etc. - **Normalização e Codificação:** Dependendo do seu modelo, você pode precisar normalizar números (e.g., preços) ou codificar variáveis categóricas em um formato numérico. # 2. Escolha do Modelo de Inteligência Artificial Para gerar novos nomes de domínio a partir dos dados, você pode usar modelos que se baseiam em padrões das informações fornecidas. Aqui estão algumas abordagens: - **Modelos de Regressão/Predição:** Embora mais usados para prever valores (como o preço de um domínio), podem ajudar a identificar características que contribuem para um alto valor de venda. - **Modelos de Classificação:** Se seus dados estão categorizados de alguma forma (e.g., 'venda alta', 'venda média', 'venda baixa'), você pode treinar um modelo para classificar características de domínios de alta venda. - **Modelos Generativos:** Modelos de IA, como GPT (Transformers), podem ser treinados para gerar nomes de domínios novos a partir de padrões encontrados nos seus dados. # 3. Geração de Novos Domínios Supondo que você decida usar um modelo generativo, como o GPT, após o treinamento com os seus dados históricos, você pode começar a gerar nomes com base nas características dos domínios mais valiosos. Você deve definir critérios claros de geração para direcionar o modelo a produzir resultados valiosos. # 4. Pós-processamento e Validação Após a geração dos nomes, você precisará verificar a disponibilidade desses domínios, o que pode ser feito utilizando APIs de registradores de domínio. É também importante avaliar manualmente os domínios gerados para garantir que eles façam sentido e tenham potencial de comercialização. # Nota Sobre Capacidade de Processamento Processar 10 mil registros não é uma tarefa demasiadamente pesada para um computador adequado, desde que devidamente programado. A questão maior está na complexidade de treinar um modelo de IA, o que geralmente requer GPUs para processamento se você pretende realizar treinamentos de modelos complexos, como os baseados em deep learning. # Ferramentas e Bibliotecas que Podem Ajudar - **Python:** Linguagem de programação com muitas bibliotecas para data science, como Pandas (para manipulação de dados), Scikit-learn (para modelagem preditiva), TensorFlow ou PyTorch (para deep learning). - **OpenAI's GPT:** Para modelos generativos, você pode explorar o uso de APIs de modelos pré-treinados, como o GPT-3 da OpenAI, que pode ser adaptado para tarefas de geração de texto. Este projeto é complexo e exige conhecimentos em análise de dados, modelagem de IA e também um bom entendimento do mercado de domínios.

tentar identificar padrões e características que influenciam os valores de venda dos domínios. Note que, sem um acesso direto e análise profunda de cada domínio individual e suas circunstâncias de venda, qualquer conclusão será um tanto genérica. # Características Comuns em Domínios de Alto Valor: 1. **Brevidade**: Domínios mais curtos tendem a ser mais valorizados. Eles são mais fáceis de lembrar, digitar e, geralmente, têm maior potencial de marca. Exemplo: x.ar (99,888 USD). 2. **Facilidade de Pronúncia e Memorização**: Domínios fáceis de pronunciar e lembrar geralmente têm mais valor. Isso aumenta seu potencial de marketing e reconhecimento da marca. 3. **Palavras-Chave ou Termos de Pesquisa**: Domínios que contêm palavras-chave com alto volume de pesquisa ou que representam um setor específico tendem a ter um valor mais alto. Por exemplo, domínios relacionados à tecnologia, finanças e saúde. 4. **Extensão do Domínio**: Alguns TLDs (Top-Level Domains), como .com, têm tradicionalmente mais valor devido à sua popularidade e ao reconhecimento da marca. 5. **Genericidade**: Domínios que representam categorias amplas ou produtos têm alto potencial de uso comercial. Exemplo: freshmint.com (6,200 USD). # Análise de Alguns Domínios de Alto Valor: - **x.ar**: Este domínio é extremamente curto e conta com uma letra única, o que é raríssimo. Além disso, utiliza um ccTLD (country code top-level domain), que pode ter significado específico ou valor para marcas ou entidades relacionadas à área geográfica correspondente. - **sourcestats.com**: Este domínio pode ter valor por incluir palavras-chave relacionadas à análise de dados ou estatísticas, áreas com grande interesse atual. - **freshmint.com**: Combina 'fresh' e 'mint', termos atraentes tanto para o mercado de produtos de higiene quanto para o financeiro (com \\"mint\\" sendo uma gíria para dinheiro), indicando versatilidade. # Sugestões para Novos Domínios: 1. **Foco em Brevidade e Simplicidade**: Considere criar nomes curtos, que sejam fáceis de digitar e lembrar. 2. **Uso de Palavras-Chave**: Identifique nichos de mercado em alta e tente incorporar palavras-chave relevantes ao domínio. 3. **Exploração de Novos TLDs**: Apesar de .com ser o mais valioso, outros TLDs estão ganhando reconhecimento. Avalie o uso de .io, .ai, .co, especialmente se estiverem alinhados ao nicho do site (por exemplo, tecnologia). 4. **Originalidade e Branding**: Pense em nomes que possam virar uma marca forte. Utilizando ferramentas de análise de SEO e tendências de mercado, você pode identificar termos e nichos em crescimento para criar novos domínios. Lembre-se, contudo, que a especulação em domínios traz riscos, e o valor de um domínio pode ser bastante subjetivo e variar com o tempo e as tendências de mercado."},{"instruction":"agora crie pra mim 100 dominios com essas caractaristicas","output":"Criar 100 domínios de forma significativa e ponderada exige uma compreensão sólida das atuais tendências de mercado, dos nichos e das indústrias em ascensão.

Midwives have been assisting women in childbirth for centuries and were the primary care providers for pregnant women throughout much of history. The term \\"midwife\\" comes from the Old English words \\"mid,\\" meaning \\"with,\\" and \\"wif,\\" meaning \\"woman,\\" thus indicating a woman who is with the mother during childbirth. In addition, there were \\"obstetricians\\" in historical contexts once the medical field began to formalize, but this term and role as we understand it today only came into prominence a few centuries ago. Before then, and in many societies, physicians (often men) were typically called upon only in complicated deliveries, while midwives (usually women) managed the majority of childbirths. Historically, another term, \\"man-midwife,\\" began to be used in the 17th and 18th centuries to describe male practitioners in the field of obstetrics, which reflects the transition period where men started to enter the profession of assisting childbirth, a role traditionally held by women. Over time, as the medical profession evolved, these practitioners came to be known simply as obstetricians, regardless of gender."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Their mix of obscure tracks and local band features was something special. Can’t believe it’s shutting down. Does anyone know why? **StaticSoul**: Read somewhere that they couldn’t keep up with the digital transition. Plus, funding issues, I guess. It's really sad to see them go. **BeatBopper**: That farewell loop is haunting. They’ve got snippets of their most memorable moments and that last message with the echo... “Thank you for tuning in, for all the waves we rode together… goodbye, goodbye, goodbye…” gave me chills! **AnalogHeart**: It’s poignant how they chose to end with an echoed goodbye. Like the final reminder of how radio waves just travel outwards, potentially forever. I recorded it, can’t bear to let it disappear into the ether. **FrequencyFreak**: Does anyone know if there's a way to support the staff or keep the legacy alive in some way? This can’t just be the end, right? **TunerTim**: I’m thinking of hosting a little tribute via my online community radio. Maybe a marathon of RadioEcho44’s greatest hits and memorable moments.

I have a bunch of recordings and would love to contribute. It's crucial to preserve these moments for future generations of radio enthusiasts. **WaveRider77**: What a wonderful community we have here.

Seems like Mediaale is slowly transitioning the waves to their other brands. **SignalSeeker**: Yes, I caught that! Was a bit surprised to suddenly find a pop music station where our beloved Echo44 used to be. I guess the radio landscape is really evolving. **BeatBopper**: It’s bittersweet. On one hand, I'm glad the frequency isn’t just dead air. On the other, it's hard not to miss the unique charm RadioEcho44 had. This new station just doesn’t have the same soul. **WaveRider77**: Noticed that too. One of the frequencies turned into a talk radio segment focusing on technology. It’s interesting but a stark departure from what Echo44 was about. I suppose this is just how things go in the media world. **TunerTim**: It’s a smart move by Mediaale, using established frequencies to grow their portfolio. But it does raise questions about diversity in broadcasting. Are we losing our unique voices to more commercial endeavors? **AnalogHeart**: That’s a valid concern, @TunerTim. It seems with each passing day, the airwaves become more homogenized. It’s why preserving broadcasts like RadioEcho44's is so essential. It serves as a reminder of the diverse, eclectic voice radio once had. **StaticSoul**: I tuned into one of the transitions, and it was surreal. They actually had a moment of silence before starting the new programming. A small tribute, or maybe just standard practice? Either way, it felt significant. **VintageVinyl**: Has anyone else started exploring more community and internet-based radio because of this? I find myself seeking out those unique, niche broadcasts more than ever now. **FrequencyFreak**: Definitely, @VintageVinyl. It’s like rediscovering the spirit of RadioEcho44 in different corners of the audio world. There’s something really special about finding a broadcast that speaks to you personally. **SignalSeeker**: I think this transition has sparked an interesting discussion on the future of radio. How do we maintain the balance between commercial success and original, meaningful content? Perhaps this is a wakeup call for us radio enthusiasts to create and support the content we want to see in the world. **WaveRider77**: Well said, @SignalSeeker. It’s on us to carry the torch. Echo44 might be fading into the past, but its influence is clearly inspiring a new generation of broadcasters and listeners alike. **TunerTim**: Absolutely.

My theory is that Mediaale might be planning to launch a new station that honors the legacy of RadioEcho44 in some way.

Keeping the loop running might be a way to keep the frequencies alive in listeners' minds. **TunerTim**: I like the idea of a tribute station, but I'm cautiously optimistic. The true essence of RadioEcho44 came from its unique programming and connection to the community. It’d be a tall order for any new station to replicate that feel. **AnalogHeart**: I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Mediaale has a track record of prioritizing commercial success over niche appeal. Maybe they’re just holding the frequencies until they finalize their plans? I’d love to be proven wrong, though. **StaticSoul**: What if we, as a community, could influence what happens next? Perhaps we could start a petition or social media campaign suggesting the creation of a station that carries forward the legacy of RadioEcho44. Mediaale might see the value in catering to an engaged audience. **FrequencyFreak**: That’s an amazing idea, @StaticSoul! There’s clearly enough of us who miss RadioEcho44 and would support a station that honors its memory.

2022-CN是两种不同的中文编码标准，它们之间有一些关键的区别： 1. **编码范围与支持的字符集** - **GB18030**：是中国国家标准的编码，支持从最基本的ASCII字符到中国国家标准GB字符集的全部字符，覆盖了中日韩统一表意文字（CJK Unified Ideographs）以及扩展A、B、C、D、E、F、G（截至2023年）等字符区块。GB18030是一种多字节字符集（MBCS），每个字符的编码可以是1个、2个或4个字节长。 - **ISO 2022-CN**：是一种用于简体中文的字符编码体系，属于ISO 2022标准的一部分，这个标准定义了一种使用逃逸序列来切换字符集的机制。ISO 2022-CN主要支持GB 2312字符集，以及一定程度上的GB/T 12345-90和ISO-IR-165。它通常使用双字节表示一个中文字符，但由于其使用逃逸序列切换不同编码模式的特性，也可以支持其他字符集。 2. **应用领域** - **GB18030**：在中国几乎所有的操作系统和移动平台上都有支持，是进行国际化软件开发时必须支持的编码标准之一。它是中国政府公布的法律要求，所有在中国市场销售的软件和操作系统都必须支持GB18030编码。 - **ISO 2022-CN**：主要用于某些网络通信协议和电子邮件中，现在在现代互联网应用中使用得较少，更多地被UTF-8等更加通用和方便的编码取代。 3. **向后兼容性** - **GB18030**：向下兼容GB2312和GBK，意味着它能够识别和显示这些旧编码中的字符。 - **ISO 2022-CN**：可以通过特定的逃逸序列来兼容GB2312，但其本身并不直接兼容GB18030或GBK。 综上所述，GB18030和ISO 2022-CN的主要区别在于它们支持的字符集范围、应用场景以及如何在系统中实现和使用。GB18030是一个更为全面和现代的标准，适用于需要支持广泛中文字符的场景，而ISO 2022-CN则更多用于特定的历史或兼容性需求较高的场景。随着时代的发展，GB18030因其广泛的兼容性和支持而变得更加重要。"},{"instruction":"shutdown

创建一个新的空文件 要创建一个新的空文件，只需要输入\`touch\`命令后跟你想创建的文件的名称。例如，创建一个名为\`example.txt\`的空文件： \`\`\`bash touch example.txt \`\`\` 如果\`example.txt\`文件不存在，\`touch\`命令将创建它。如果该文件已存在，\`touch\`命令将更新文件的访问和修改时间戳为当前时间。 # 更新文件的时间戳 \`touch\`命令通常用来更新文件的时间戳，不改变文件内容。如果要更新一个文件的时间戳，执行与创建文件相同的命令： \`\`\`bash touch existingfile.txt \`\`\` 这将会把\`existingfile.txt\`的访问和修改时间戳更新为当前时间。 # 创建多个文件 你也可以一次创建多个空文件，只需要在命令中列出所有你希望创建的文件名。例如： \`\`\`bash touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt \`\`\` 这个命令将一次性创建\`file1.txt\`、\`file2.txt\`、和\`file3.txt\`三个空文件。 # 使用选项指定时间戳 \`touch\`命令允许你使用\`-t\`选项手动指定文件的时间戳。时间戳的格式为\`[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]\`，其中\`CC\`代表世纪，\`YY\`代表年份，\`MM\`代表月，\`DD\`代表日，\`hh\`代表小时，\`mm\`代表分钟，\`SS\`代表秒（可选）。 例如，将文件\`file.txt\`的时间戳更改为2020年1月2日3点4分： \`\`\`bash touch -t 202001020304 file.txt \`\`\` # 将文件的时间戳更改为与另一个文件相同 使用\`-r\`选项，你可以将一个文件的时间戳更改为与另一个文件相同。例如，将\`file2.txt\`的时间戳更改为与\`file1.txt\`相同： \`\`\`bash touch -r file1.txt file2.txt \`\`\` # 结论 \`touch\`命令在macOS终端中是处理文件时间戳和创建空文件的强大工具。它简单易用，是开发者、系统管理员和终端用户的重要工具之一。想了解更多关于\`touch\`命令的高级用法，可以通过输入\`man touch\`查看终端中的手册页面。"},{"instruction":"在java中, 我为什么看不到clone操作的具体代码实现?","output":"在Java中，\`clone()\`方法是\`java.lang.Object\`类的一个protected方法，用于创建并返回调用该方法对象的一个拷贝。由于\`clone()\`方法是在Java的核心类库中实现的，具体的实现细节是在JVM（Java虚拟机）层面处理的，而不是通过Java语言直接实现的。这意味着，你在Java代码中通常看不到\`clone()\`方法的具体执行代码，只能看到它的声明。 \`\`\`java protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException; \`\`\` 这里有几个关键点需要注意： 1. **Native方法**：\`clone()\`方法被标记为\`native\`，这表明它的实现是用非Java语言（如C或C++）实现的，且是JVM内置的。Native方法可以直接访问操作系统的资源或特定硬件，这也是为什么\`clone()\`方法的具体实现取决于JVM，而不是Java代码本身。 2. **protected访问控制符**：由于\`clone()\`方法是\`protected\`的，因此它只能被同一包内的类或所有子类访问。如果你想要在你的类中使用\`clone()\`方法，你的类需要实现\`Cloneable\`接口，并且重写\`clone()\`方法，使之public或其他访问级别，然后在方法内部调用\`super.clone()\`。值得注意的是，实现\`Cloneable\`接口是必要的，因为它是一个标记接口，用于告知\`Object.clone()\`实现，该对象的字段可以被逐个字节复制。 3. **浅拷贝 vs 深拷贝**：默认的\`clone()\`方法实现提供的是浅拷贝，意味着它只复制对象的基本数据类型的字段值和对象的引用，而不复制引用指向的对象。如果需要实现深拷贝（复制整个对象图），需要在\`clone()\`方法的重写中手动实现。 这些因素导致了\`clone()\`方法在Java中经常被认为是复杂且难以正确使用的功能。因为正确地使用\`clone()\`需要对Java的内存模型和对象的内部结构有深刻的理解，同时还得小心地处理深拷贝和浅拷贝的问题。此外，许多Java开发者和框架选择使用其他拷贝对象的方法，比如拷贝构造函数、工厂方法、或使用第三方库，例如Apache Commons Lang的\`SerializationUtils.clone()\`（需序列化对象）等，来避免\`clone()\`方法的复杂性和潜在风险。"},{"instruction":"java中如何使用深拷贝?","output":"在Java中实现深拷贝可以有几种方法，选择哪一种取决于具体的使用场景和需求。深拷贝意味着在拷贝过程中创建对象以及其内部对象的完整拷贝，这和浅拷贝不同，浅拷贝只复制对象的引用而不复制引用指向的对象。以下是一些实现深拷贝的方法： # 1. 通过实现\`Cloneable\`接口并重写\`clone()\`方法 这需要手动在\`clone()\`方法中为内部的可变对象创建新实例。这种方法要求你有很好的了解哪些成员是可变的，并且对它们分别进行深拷贝。 \`\`\`java public class Example implements Cloneable { private int[] arr; public Example() { arr = new int[10]; // 为了示例，初始化数组 for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { arr[i] = i; } } @Override public Example clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException { Example cloned = (Example) super.clone(); cloned.arr = arr.clone(); // 对数组进行深拷贝 return cloned; } } \`\`\` # 2. 通过序列化和反序列化 这种方法要求对象以及对象内部所有需要深拷贝的对象都实现\`Serializable\`接口。然后，可以通过序列化对象到一个流中，接着再反序列化回来，从而实现深拷贝。这种方法相对简单，但性能上不如手动实现\`clone()\`。 \`\`\`java import java.io.*; public class DeepCopyViaSerialization { @SuppressWarnings(\\"unchecked\\") public static <T extends Serializable> T deepCopy(T object) { try { ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos); oos.writeObject(object); oos.close(); ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(baos.toByteArray()); ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bais); return (T) ois.readObject(); } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } } } \`\`\` # 3. 使用拷贝构造函数或拷贝工厂方法 这要求为类手动提供一个构造函数或者工厂方法，这个方法接受一个对象作为参数，然后为其内的所有字段创建新实例。 \`\`\`java public class Example { private int[] arr; public Example() { arr = new int[10]; for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { arr[i] = i; } } // 拷贝构造函数 public Example(Example other) { this.arr = other.arr.clone(); // 对数组进行深拷贝 } } \`\`\` # 4. 使用第三方库 一些第三方库如Apache Commons Lang提供了深拷贝的工具方法，如\`SerializationUtils.clone()\`（要求对象实现\`Serializable\`接口）。 \`\`\`java Example original = new Example(); Example copied = SerializationUtils.clone(original); \`\`\` # 结论 深拷贝在处理对象时可以避免很多潜在的问题，特别是在对象具有复杂内部结构时。不过，实现深拷贝也更加复杂，需要更多的代码和对性能的考量。在实现深拷贝时，选择最适合你的需求和场景的方法非常重要。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator

Humphrey and Balto end up howling so hard that they end up waking other animated canines from the animated multiverse up and end up receiving a noise complaint.","output":"In the tranquil expanse of Alaska, under a blanket of twinkling stars and the ethereal glow of the Northern Lights, a most unprecedented meeting was about to take place. The stage was set for a union of legends from different realms, united by the spirit of adventure and the pure essence of their wolf heritage. From the lush, vibrant lands of Jasper Park, Humphrey, the fun-loving Omega wolf of the Western Pack, had ventured far beyond his territory, driven by tales of a hero whose bravery knew no bounds. This hero was none other than Balto, the wolfdog hybrid who had coursed through treacherous snow to deliver medicine, saving the children of Nome. As Humphrey made his way through the frostbitten landscape, the moon beckoning him onward, he finally stumbled upon the figure of Balto, standing majestically atop a snowdrift, his gaze fixed on the horizon. Their eyes met, and an unspoken respect blossomed between the two, bridging their worlds with the realization that they were kin, not by blood, but by heart. \\"Are you Balto? The legend who raced against death itself?\\" Humphrey inquired, his tone a mix of awe and curiosity. Balto nodded, his wise eyes reflecting years of adventures and trials. \\"And you must be Humphrey. I've heard tales of your journey across the country. What brings you here?\\" \\"I've come seeking a challenge, one that will let our howls resonate across these lands and beyond,\\" Humphrey declared, his voice growing spirited. Balto's curiosity was piqued. \\"A challenge, you say?\\" \\"Yes, a howling contest! Let's see whose howl can reach the farthest, touching the hearts of those who hear it,\\" Humphrey suggested, his tail wagging in anticipation. Balto, amused and intrigued, agreed. \\"Very well, Humphrey. Let's howl not as rivals, but as brothers under the same sky.\\" They took their positions, the air around them charged with excitement. With a deep breath, Humphrey tilted his head back and let out a long, melodic howl, filled with the joy and the spirit of the Omega. The sound carried far and wide, echoing through the valleys and over the mountaintops. Not to be outdone, Balto responded with a howl that was deep and soulful, a testament to his journeys and the wisdom he had gathered. His voice rolled like thunder, blending seamlessly with Humphrey's tones, creating a harmonious symphony under the starlit sky. Their howls intertwined, spiraling upward, strong and pure. However, their powerful voices did not go unnoticed. As the melodious uproar continued, various animated canines from the animated multiverse began to stir from their slumber. From Lady of \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" to Chief of \\"The Fox and the Hound\\" and even Bolt, the superdog himself, they all found themselves awakened by the impassioned contest, their dreams interrupted by the distant, yet compelling calls. As the night wore on, the unexpected audience grew restless. Despite the beauty of the harmonious howl, sleep-deprived grumbles and barks of protest eventually coalesced into a collective noise complaint that transcended the boundaries of their worlds, making its way to the howling duo. Realizing the disturbance they had caused, Humphrey and Balto sheepishly halted their contest, exchanging embarrassed glances. True, they had wanted to make their mark, but certainly not as public nuisances. As the first rays of dawn painted the sky in hues of pink and gold, they knew it was time to make amends. Together, they embarked on a journey through the animated multiverse, offering apologies and good-natured laughs, sharing tales of their misadventure. Their genuine camaraderie and heartfelt amends soon won over the hearts of the roused canines, turning what had begun as a howling contest into a celebration of unity among the diverse characters of their worlds. And though no winner was declared in their original challenge, the legend of their extraordinary duet lived on, a story whispered on the wind and howled to the moon, about the night when Humphrey and Balto brought together the animated canine multiverse with nothing but their voices and their indomitable spirits."},{"instruction":"a surrealist painting with sunflowers with yellow water dripping all over, in the style of surrealistic grotesque, nature scenes, delicate brushstrokes, iconic, massurrealism --ar 35:64 --stylize 750","output":"I'm unable to directly create or display images, but I can guide you in imagining or conceptualizing such a unique surrealist painting. Picture this: A vast, expansive canvas stretched into a slender, wide rectangle with the aspect ratio of 35:64, providing an elongated landscape that mesmerizes the viewer. At first glance, the scene encapsulates a field brimming with sunflowers, yet there's a dreamlike twist that propels it into the realm of surrealism. The sunflowers, towering and robust, stretch across the canvas, their faces large and turned toward an unseen source of light, not the sun but perhaps an otherworldly glow. The petals are exaggerated, almost sentient, bending and curling at the edges, reminiscent of delicate brushstrokes that convey both beauty and an unsettling eerieness. From the heavens above, or perhaps blooming from the surreal, cloud-like formations, yellow water begins to drip onto the scene. This isn't just a light drizzle but a thick, glowing liquid that pours over the petals and stems with a luminous intensity. Each droplet is carefully rendered with a grotesque beauty, distorting as it blends with the natural colors of the sunflowers, creating an almost alchemical transformation upon contact. The entire composition is bathed in a light that is both ethereal and unnerving, casting long, twisted shadows across a ground that seems less solid earth and more a fluid, dreamlike plane. The edges of the painting might blur, the landscape gently folding into itself, a characteristic of Massurrealism, where technology, surrealism, and mass media merge to create new realities. In places, the delicate brushstrokes give way to hyper-detailed grotesqueness, revealing unexpected textures on the skins of the flowers—perhaps faces or eyes opening within the petals and stems, watching the viewer, adding a layer of iconic surrealism. Nature itself is both familiar and bizarrely altered, inviting the observer to question reality, perception, and the grotesquely beautiful interplay between the natural and the surreal. Though no painting exists in this description, the image is vivid: a testament to the enduring power and infinite possibilities of surrealistic art, a dream captured on canvas, where every detail holds a deeper meaning, waiting to be explored."},{"instruction":"a surrealist painting with sunflowers with yellow water dripping all over, in the style of surrealistic grotesque, nature scenes, delicate brushstrokes, iconic, massurrealism --ar 35:64 --stylize 750, normal, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, Begin title with \\"Wooden Wall Clock\\", do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"Wooden Wall Clock: Grotesque Sunflower Dreamscape in Surreal Yellow Waters"},{"instruction":"a surrealist painting with sunflowers with yellow water dripping all over, in the style of surrealistic grotesque, nature scenes, delicate brushstrokes, iconic, massurrealism --ar 35:64 --stylize 750, normal, generate a description that is personable and describe the {model} Wooden Wall Clock, include its a great gift for people, collections or theme, Pre-installed backside hook For indoor use Requires one AA battery (NOT included) Silent clock mechanism Materials: 100% wood (frame), 100% plexiglass (face), 100% metal (mechanism) One size: 10\\" x 10\\" (25.4 x 25.4 cm), do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"In an entrancing blend of surrealism and grotesque, imagine a painting where sunflowers don't simply bask under a bright sky; instead, they defy nature's law, exuding a surreal, yellow water that drips all over the scene.

Each brushstroke delicately weaves this unique vision, creating an iconic image that beckons the viewer to step into a world where reality is gently twisted into something beautifully unnerving. In this same vein of unique artistic creation, we introduce a masterpiece of functional artistry — the Wooden Wall Clock. Crafted with a surrealist touch that complements any collector's theme or aesthetic, this clock melds the unexpected with the familiar. The frame, made from 100% wood, holds a mystery within its grains, telling more than just time. Its face, shielded by 100% plexiglass, ensures durability while adding a modern touch to the organic nature of wood. At the heart, a 100% metal mechanism operates in silence, respecting the serene ambiance of any room it adorns. Measuring 10\\" x 10\\" (25.4 x 25.4 cm), it's a statement piece that complements any room, adding a dash of surrealism to your home or office. Enhanced by a pre-installed backside hook, its installation is as effortless as its aesthetic is captivating, requiring only a single AA battery to begin its silent sweep over time. This clock isn't just a piece of decor; it's an homage to the surreal, the grotesque, and the beauty found in the unnatural. It's a wonderful gift for those who appreciate the eccentricity in art or those looking to start their collection with something truly unique. Whether for a friend, a family member, or yourself, this Wooden Wall Clock transcends mere functionality. It becomes a timeless piece of art, inviting onlookers to ponder the fluidity of time amidst the fixed reality, much like the surreal sunflowers dripping yellow water in a painting that defies all logic."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

But now he is just a boy with too much curiosity..","output":"From the mist-shrouded crags of his coastal village, our hero, Eren, was born into a world where the line between myth and reality was as blurred as the horizon at sea. His father was a pragmatic fisherman, a man of nets and knots, who considered the sea both his livelihood and his adversary. His mother, however, was a weaver of tales, a woman whose ancestors hailed from a mysterious lineage steeped in the arcane. She would fill Eren's nights with stories of spectral ships, sea-wraiths, and the lost kingdom of Aqualon that was said to lie submerged beneath their very waters. This dichotomy within his household served as the fertile ground on which Eren's obsession with the esoteric was sown. His fervent curiosity was kindled further by an event that would mark the trajectory of his life. On a fateful stormy night, when Eren was but seven years of age, his family's cottage was visited by an apparition. It was his great-grandmother, a reputed sorceress in her life, who had come to warn them of an impending calamity at sea. Eren's father, ever the skeptic, dismissed it as a trick of the light and the roar of the storm. However, Eren and his mother heeded the phantom's warning, and they prevented the fishermen, including his father, from setting out to sea the next day. A fierce squall swept the coast, capsizing boats and claiming the lives of those who had dared the tempest. From that night on, Eren's interest in the supernatural was no longer a mere fascination; it became his calling. He saw in himself a guardian of sorts, someone who could bridge the world of the living and the dead, protecting his village from unseen dangers. His quests for knowledge and mastery over spirits led him to Wrin, the Aasimar elf, who recognized the boy's rare gift and took him under his wing. Wrin's tutelage was unorthodox, incorporating lessons on history, mythology, and the arcane, with practical applications of spirit hunting. Among his many teachings, Wrin impressed upon Eren the importance of understanding the stories and desires of ghosts, for not all spirits were malevolent, and many yearned for nothing more than to pass on peacefully. As Eren grew, so did his reputation. He became known as the 'Ghost's Whisperer' among the villagers, a title he bore with a humble pride. Yet his heart yearned for adventures beyond the confines of his village. Despite his love for his home, he knew that the world held mysteries that were waiting to be uncovered. It was during one of his explorations in the forested outskirts of the village that Eren stumbled upon an ancient, moss-covered entrance, partially hidden by ferns and the underbrush. The air around it was thick with magic, and the engravings on the stone told of it being a tomb, one that legends spoke of but was thought to be lost to time. A tomb that was rumored to be the final resting place of a powerful artifact linked to Aqualon's downfall. Fate, it seemed, had laid the path for our young hero. Armed with his knowledge, his courage, and the teachings of Wrin, Eren stood at the threshold of destiny. He was no longer just a boy with too much curiosity. He was a burgeoning adventurer at the cusp of uncovering truths that would not only change his life but perhaps the very fabric of the world. The tomb beneath his hometown awaited, and with it, the beginning of an epic saga."},{"instruction":"服务器更换显卡， llama2_api: image: ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:1.4 container_name: llama2_api command: --model-id /data/llama2/llama2-chat-13b-hf volumes: - /data/wanghui01/models/:/data/ ports: - \\"8081:80\\" environment: NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: all shm_size: 1g deploy: resources: reservations: devices: - driver: nvidia count: all capabilities: [gpu] 只在第一块GPU上运行，实际有8块 怎么办","output":"若要在具有多块GPU的服务器上正确配置容器以使用特定的GPU或所有GPU，你需要确保服务器上安装了NVIDIA Docker工具（nvidia-docker），并且Docker版本支持GPU。从你提供的配置来看，你已经设置了\`NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: all\`，希望所有GPU都能被容器使用。然而，如果实际只在第一块GPU上运行，可能的原因和解决方案如下： # 1. 检查NVIDIA Docker版本 确保你的服务器安装了最新版的nvidia-docker。可以通过运行以下命令升级nvidia-docker： \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2 sudo systemctl restart docker \`\`\` 这确保了你可以使用Docker的\`--gpus\`参数或Docker Compose v2中对GPU的支持。 # 2. 使用Docker Compose GPU设置（如果适用） 如果你正在使用Docker Compose，并且版本支持直接的GPU分配（需要Docker Compose v2.3及以上），你可以尝试更新你的\`docker-compose.yml\`文件以使用更直观的GPU设置： \`\`\`yaml services: llama2_api: image: ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:1.4 container_name: llama2_api command: --model-id /data/llama2/llama2-chat-13b-hf volumes: - /data/wanghui01/models/:/data/ ports: - \\"8081:80\\" environment: NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: all deploy: resources: reservations: devices: - capabilities: [gpu] \`\`\` 请注意，Docker和Docker Compose在GPU资源管理方面的规范和版本支持可能有所不同，确保查看最新的文档。 # 3. 直接通过Docker运行 如果使用Docker直接运行而不是通过Compose进行部署，尝试以下命令以确保可以访问所有GPU： \`\`\`bash docker run --gpus all -v /data/wanghui01/models/:/data/ -p 8081:80 --shm-size=1g --name llama2_api ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:1.4 --model-id /data/llama2/llama2-chat-13b-hf \`\`\` 在这里，\`--gpus all\`选项指示Docker运行时使所有GPU对容器可见。 # 4.

Contudo, é possível identificar alguns padrões e características que, geralmente, aumentam o valor de um domínio. Vou destacar essas características e, com base nelas, listar alguns critérios para a criação de uma lista nova de domínios. # Características dos Domínios de Alto Valor: 1. **Palavras Comuns e Genéricas:** Domínios como \\"galatea.com\\" ou \\"variant.com\\" são altamente valiosos porque consistem em palavras comuns/genéricas, tornando-os desejáveis para uma ampla gama de usos e negócios. 2. **Facilidade de Memorização:** Domínios de palavra única que são fáceis de lembrar, como \\"modu.com\\" ou \\"berg.com\\", tendem a ser mais valiosos. 3. **Extensões Populares:** Extensões como .com, .ai, .org, entre outras, apresentam uma demanda constante no mercado. A proximidade com uma extensão .com pode aumentar significativamente o valor do domínio. 4. **Relevância de Tendência:** Domínios que se alinham com tendências atuais ou tecnologias emergentes, como \\"invent.ai\\" ou \\"halo.xyz\\", também podem alcançar valores mais altos de venda. 5. **Nomes Curtos:** Domínios curtos, como \\"n.et\\" ou \\"lvk.com\\", são altamente procurados devido à sua raridade e facilidade de memorização. 6. **Potencial Comercial:** Domínios que sugerem um forte potencial para o comércio eletrônico, como \\"buy.ca\\", são extremamente valiosos devido ao seu apelo direto aos negócios online. # Lista de 200 Novos Domínios (Exemplos): Dada a complexidade e os múltiplos fatores considerados pelos investidores e empresas na compra de domínios, a criação de uma lista de 200 novos domínios, seguindo as características acima, é um exercício teórico e criativo. Aqui estão algumas sugestões de critérios que poderiam orientar a criação de tais domínios: 1. **Palavras Chave relacionadas a Negócios e Tecnologia:** PrimeNow.com, TechLaunch.io, FinGuru.org 2. **Utilizar Tendências e Temas Atuais:** EcoWear.com, VRSpace.org, HealthTech.ai 3. **Nomes Curtos e Memoráveis com Extensões Populares:** Zeqo.com, Rivo.net, Clik.org 4. **Brincar com Palavras e Criar Nomes de Marca:** Brandlytic.com, Innovise.org, Zenity.io 5. **Enfoque em Setores Específicos:** TravelHive.com, FoodieJoy.org, LearnCode.ai Conclusão: A lista acima oferece uma direção geral, e a escolha final dos domínios deve ser influenciada por pesquisa de mercado detalhada, verificação da disponibilidade dos domínios, e um entendimento claro do setor ou nicho específico visado.

Text: Can you come up with some ideas for character in the fantasy ttrpg Pathfinder’s setting—Glorian? The character is a young man from a sleepy fishing town called Otari, on the coast of the Starstone Isle not far from the metropolis Absalom. He was obsessed with the esoterics and the supernatural. For whatever reason, he often fancy himself to grow up and become a powerful hunter of ghosts and other undead monsters, putting spirits to peace. He is also obsessed with mystery and different kinds of antiques and trinkets, as well as hidden lore of creatures and legends. Since he was a kid, he frequented the Magic shop in town owned by a quirky but incredibly friendly Aasimar elf named Wrin, in search of mysterious objects. Wrin was fond of him and taught him how to be a ghost hunter. Now, please come up with a creative backstory of this character, including an intriguing reason why he is obsessed with the obscure. This character should be a hero of an ensemble cast story, who will, in the future story, goes on to become an adventurer in the tomb beneath his hometown. But now he is just a boy with too much curiosity…","output":"In the quaint, sea-breeze-kissed town of Otari, the young man’s life was steeped in the ordinary rhythms of fishing and trade. However, his world was anything but ordinary beneath the surface. His obsession with the esoteric and supernatural was kindled one fateful night, which would forever shift the trajectory of his life and dreams. As a child, the young man, named Caelum, was awakened one stormy night by an ethereal melody emanating from the beach. Driven by an inexplicable pull, he found his way to the shore, where amidst the tumult of the crashing waves and lightning, he saw the silhouette of a spectral woman dancing on the foam. Caelum watched, entranced, until the first light of dawn broke the spell, and the apparition vanished. The citizens of Otari whispered about the legend of a sea maiden, a spirit bound to the coast, a tale Caelum’s logical mind had always rejected until that night. This encounter planted a seed of unrelenting curiosity and a hunger for understanding the unseen world. He wondered if the spirit was merely one of many concealed mysteries of the world, yearning for someone to uncover their stories and bring them peace. Thus began Caelum’s obsession with ghost hunting, antiques with hidden pasts, and the secret lore of creatures and legends. He dreamt of wielding the power to interact with the supernatural realm responsibly and mercifully, providing solace to restless spirits. Wrin, the Aasimar elf who owned the local Magic shop, recognized a kindred spirit in the boy. Wrin, himself, had ventured from the ethereal realms to the material, bearing knowledge of the ancients and arcane. He saw potential in Caelum’s pure-hearted fascination and decided to nurture it by teaching him the rudiments of ghost hunting and understanding the spiritual world. Under Wrin’s mentorship, Caelum learned not only about spirits but also about protection amulets, ghost traps, and the importance of respecting the entities he sought to understand. Caelum’s drive also stemmed from a deeply personal space—his father, a fisherman, was lost at sea when Caelum was but a toddler. Though his body was never recovered, his mother always held that his spirit watched over them. This belief, intertwined with his encounter with the sea spirit, fortified Caelum’s resolve to connect with the spiritual realm, hoping to one day understand his father’s fate and, if possible, communicate with him. Now standing on the brink of manhood, Caelum is no longer just a boy with a whimsical dream. His experiences and Wrin’s guidance have prepared him for a journey that extends beyond the quaint borders of Otari. When rumors and tales surface about a long-forgotten tomb beneath the town — rumored to be filled with undead and haunted by lingering spirits — Caelum knows his moment has arrived. Armed with his knowledge, his mentors' teachings, and an unquenchable thirst for unveiling the mysteries of the supernatural, Caelum steps toward his destiny. As a hero in an ensemble cast of adventurers, Caelum brings his unique perspective to the group, blending arcane knowledge with a heartfelt understanding of the spirit realm. His quest beneath Otari is not just an adventure—it’s a personal pilgrimage, a test of his beliefs, and a chance to fulfill his childhood dream of becoming a powerful ghost hunter. Through dangers untold and dungeons deep, Caelum’s journey is about more than just battle; it’s about understanding the delicate balance between life and the afterlife, and perhaps, finding a connection with the father he never knew."},{"instruction":"1- Installation d’une minuterie Le principe de cette installation est de mettre sous tension un ou plusieurs circuits d’éclairage avec une extinction automatique au bout d’un certain temps qui est paramétrable, cela d’un ou plusieurs endroits. Le montage de la minuterie peut être soit : • Avec effet : Lors de l’allumage des lampes, le fait de ré appuyer sur le bouton provoque la mise à 0 du temps. • Ou Sans effet : Lors de l’allumage des lampes, le fait de ré appuyer sur le bouton ne provoque aucun effet sur le temps restant. Principe de fonctionnement : Dans le boîtier de la minuterie on trouve une bobine, lorsqu’elle est alimentée via les boutons poussoir, elle crée un champ magnétique. Ce champ magnétique attire les contacts de mise sous tension du circuit d’éclairage. Certaine n’ont pas de d’électroaimant mais composant électronique du type transistor qui assure la mise sous tension du circuit. Le circuit d’éclairage reste donc sous tension en fonction du temps paramétré. Sur le boiter de la minuterie on trouve généralement un petit commutateur qui permet de laisser le circuit sous tension en permanence, et un potentiomètre pour le réglage du temps. donner moi des interprétations sur l'installation d'une minuterie à partir de ça en bref .","output":"L'installation d'une minuterie dans un circuit d'éclairage est une approche pratique pour contrôler l'allumage et l'extinction des lampes de manière automatique, permettant ainsi d'économiser de l'énergie et d'augmenter le confort. Voici une interprétation concise de son principe et de ses caractéristiques basée sur la description: 1. **Fonctionnalité principale:** Une minuterie permet d'allumer les lumières pour une durée déterminée. Après ce temps prédéfini, les lampes s'éteignent automatiquement. Cela est idéal pour des scénarios où les lumières sont nécessaires temporairement, comme dans les couloirs, les escaliers, les zones de stockage, etc. 2. **Types d'installation:** Il y a deux méthodes principales d'installation - avec effet et sans effet. Dans le montage \\"avec effet\\", appuyer à nouveau sur le bouton de minuterie réinitialise le compte à rebours, permettant ainsi de prolonger la durée d'éclairage si nécessaire. En revanche, dans le montage \\"sans effet\\", appuyer à nouveau sur le bouton pendant que les lumières sont allumées ne modifie pas le temps restant, ce qui assure que la durée initialement réglée est maintenue sans interruption. 3. **Principe de fonctionnement:** La minuterie fonctionne grâce à une bobine ou à des composants électroniques (comme des transistors) qui, lorsqu'ils sont activés par un bouton-poussoir, permettent d'alimenter le circuit d'éclairage. La bobine crée un champ magnétique qui ferme le circuit d'éclairage, tandis que les composants électroniques, le cas échéant, agissent comme des interrupteurs pour maintenir le circuit fermé pendant le temps défini. 4. **Réglages:** La plupart des minuteries disposent d'un commutateur permettant de garder les lumières allumées en continu, contournant ainsi la fonction de minuterie. En outre, un potentiomètre (ou similaire) est souvent inclus pour ajuster la durée pendant laquelle les lumières restent allumées, offrant ainsi une flexibilité selon les besoins spécifiques de l'utilisateur. En résumé, l'installation d'une minuterie offre une solution efficace pour gérer l'éclairage dans des zones nécessitant un éclairage temporaire, avec des options pour ajuster la durée d'éclairage et la possibilité de réinitialiser ou non le temps restant. Cette technologie est à la fois un choix écoénergétique et pratique pour de nombreuses applications résidentielles et commerciales."},{"instruction":"2- Installation d’un télérupteur : Le télérupteur est un appareil électrique permettant la commande de l'éclairage (allumage ou extinction des lampes), de plus de deux endroits différents. Lorsque l'on appuie sur le bouton poussoir, une impulsion met le télérupteur au travail, il ferme le circuit, jusqu'à ce qu'une nouvelle impulsion l'ouvre et ainsi de suite. Fonctionnement : • Une bobine commandée par les boutons poussoirs. • Un ou de plusieurs contacts (circuit de puissance) ils commandent les points lumineux. • Un système d’accrochage mécanique permet de maintenir le contact dans la position d’ouverture ou de fermeture. Une action sur un des boutons poussoirs provoque l’enclenchement du télérupteur et de ce fait l’allumage des points lumineux. Une nouvelle action sur un des boutons poussoirs déclenche le télérupteur et l’extinction des points lumineux. donner moi des interprétations de l'installation d'un télérupteur à partir de ça en bref .","output":"L'installation d'un télérupteur est une solution efficace pour contrôler l'éclairage de plusieurs emplacements différents en utilisant de simples boutons-poussoirs. Voici une brève interprétation de son fonctionnement et de ses avantages basée sur la description fournie: 1. **Contrôle centralisé:** Le télérupteur permet d'allumer ou d'éteindre des lumières depuis plus de deux endroits, ce qui est particulièrement utile dans de grands espaces ou sur plusieurs étages où un contrôle centralisé de l'éclairage est désirable. 2. **Fonctionnement par impulsion:** L'appareil fonctionne en réagissant à des impulsions électriques générées par des boutons-poussoirs. Une impulsion active le télérupteur, fermant ainsi le circuit et allumant les lumières. Une impulsion suivante ouvre le circuit, éteignant les lumières. 3. **Composants clés:** - **Bobine:** Réagit aux impulsions des boutons-poussoirs et active les contacts internes du télérupteur. - **Contacts (circuit de puissance):** Commandent directement les points lumineux. Leur ouverture et fermeture déterminent si l'éclairage est allumé ou éteint. - **Système d’accrochage mécanique:** Maintient les contacts en position ouverte ou fermée jusqu'à ce qu'une nouvelle impulsion provoque un changement. Cela signifie que les lumières resteront dans leur état actuel (allumées ou éteintes) jusqu'à ce qu'elles reçoivent une commande pour changer. 4. **Avantages:** - Flexibilité accrue pour le contrôle de l'éclairage depuis plusieurs emplacements, améliorant ainsi la commodité et l'accessibilité. - Simplification de l'installation électrique, car il n'est pas nécessaire d'acheminer des câbles entre tous les interrupteurs et les points lumineux, réduisant ainsi le câblage et les coûts associés. - Sécurité améliorée, car le télérupteur peut centraliser le contrôle de l'éclairage, facilitant l'allumage ou l'extinction rapide des lumières en cas d'urgence. En bref, un télérupteur offre une méthode flexible et efficace pour gérer l'éclairage dans diverses installations, en permettant un contrôle multi-point à partir de boutons-poussoirs simples. Cela rend le système particulièrement adapté aux structures complexes comme les maisons sur plusieurs étages, les bureaux, ou les bâtiments publics."},{"instruction":"3- Installation de la sonnette Dans la maison, la sonnette est souvent à branchement filaire. Elle est alimentée en très basse tension (8 ou 12 V) via un transformateur 230 V / 8 ou 12 V. Celui-ci est protégé par un disjoncteur de 10 A. On trouve dans ce cas les trois appareils réunis au tableau de répartition, le plus souvent sur un même rail. Le son lui-même est commandé par un bouton-poussoir. donner moi des interprétations de l'installation de la sonnette à partir de ça en bref .","output":"L'installation d'une sonnette filaire dans une maison repose sur une configuration simple mais efficace qui utilise une tension réduite pour des raisons de sécurité et d'économie. Voici une interprétation succincte de son principe d’installation et des éléments impliqués : 1. **Configuration de base :** Une sonnette filaire typique fonctionne avec une très basse tension (8 à 12 V), ce qui est nettement inférieur à la tension standard de 230 V utilisée dans les foyers pour d'autres appareils électriques. Cette basse tension est sécuritaire pour une telle application où l'utilisateur interagit directement avec l'appareil, comme appuyer sur le bouton de la sonnette. 2. **Source d’alimentation :** Le passage de la tension standard à la très basse tension nécessaire est réalisé par un transformateur (230 V à 8 ou 12 V), ce qui permet d'alimenter la sonnette en toute sécurité. Ce transformateur est un composant clé de l'installation. 3. **Protection :** La ligne électrique alimentant le transformateur est sécurisée par un disjoncteur de 10 A. Ce dispositif de sécurité est crucial pour prévenir tout risque de surcharge ou de court-circuit qui pourrait endommager l'installation ou poser un risque d'incendie. 4. **Installation au tableau de répartition :** Le transformateur, le disjoncteur et potentiellement d'autres composants relatifs à la sonnette sont souvent montés ensemble sur le tableau de répartition, généralement fixés sur un même rail DIN. Cette centralisation facilite l'entretien et assure une installation ordonnée. 5. **Activation :** L'actionnement de la sonnette est commandé par un bouton-poussoir.

When envisioning a scene styled around samurai legends with intricate brushwork under a setting sun, we enter a world that is both dramatic and serenely poetic. Imagine the scene unfolding on a washi (traditional Japanese paper) or silk canvas, dominated by monochromatic shades of black ink, yet filled with profound depth and contrast. The samurai stands as the focal point, possibly depicted in a moment of solitude, reflecting the bushido (the way of the warrior), which emphasizes honor, courage, and discipline. The samurai could be shown in profile, capturing a moment of contemplation. The details of the armor, known as yoroi, reveal the intricate brushwork; each stroke adds depth and texture, giving life to the hard and soft elements of the armor. The helmet (kabuto), with its intricate design, signifies the status and the spirit of the samurai. In the background, the setting sun creates a dramatic backdrop, with the ink diluted to various shades of gray to depict the fading light. The sun, perhaps partially hidden by rolling hills or a silhouette of a distant Mount Fuji, casts elongated shadows and brings a warm, albeit monochromatic, glow to the scene. Delicate, yet bold brush strokes might suggest a breeze, gently swaying the grass or the cherry blossoms, adding a transient beauty to the scene. This fleeting beauty, known as mono no aware, is a celebration of the ephemeral nature of life, echoing the samurai’s readiness to face their destiny. Nature plays a significant role in the composition, with elements like a meandering stream or aged pine trees framing the scene, their rugged textures contrasting with the smooth flow of the water and the softness of the sky at dusk. These elements are not just fillers; they symbolize endurance, flow, and the transition of time. The intricate brushwork is not merely a technical showcase but a medium through which the principles of Zen Buddhism are conveyed—the harmony between man and nature, the balance between strength and softness, and the beauty of the moment. The setting sun is a powerful symbol within this context, representing both the end and the beginning, the impermanence of glory, and the cycle of life and death. This envisioned ink drawing is not just a visual representation but a narrative woven with cultural, philosophical, and aesthetic threads unique to Japanese art, capturing a moment that tells a story larger than the scene itself—a testament to the legacy of the samurai and the enduring beauty found in the mastery of sumi-e."},{"instruction":"Japanese ink drawing, in the style of samurai legends, intricate brushwork, setting sun, normal, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, Begin title with \\"Coated Greeting Cards\\", do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"Coated Greeting Cards: Samurai Legends at Sunset, Exquisite Japanese Ink Artistry"},{"instruction":"Japanese ink drawing, in the style of samurai legends, intricate brushwork, setting sun, normal, generate a 200 char length description that is personable and describe the {model} Coated Greeting card, include it being a great gift for people, collections or holiday, Material: 270gsm paper Four sizes, quantities and paper finishes to choose from Double-sided print Horizontal and vertical options available Blanks sourced from USA Envelopes included, do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"Embrace the art of Japanese ink drawing with our exquisite Samurai Legends Greeting Card.

Consequently, it is theoretically important to Miliband to know who actually controls state power at any given time. One of the most direct indicators of ruling-class domination is the degree to which members of the capitalist class control the state apparatus through interlocking positions in the governmental, administrative, coercive and other apparatuses. Miliband (1969, 54) emphasizes that: It is these institutions in which “state power” lies, and it is through them that this power is wielded in its different manifestations by the people who occupy the leading positions in each of these institutions. For this reason, Miliband attaches considerable importance to the social composition of the state elite. The class composition of a state elite creates “a strong presumption … as to its general outlook, ideological dispositions and political bias” and, thus, one way to measure the degree of potential class domination is to quantify the extent to which members of a particular class have disproportionately colonized command posts within the state apparatuses (Miliband, 1969, 55). In the eyes of critics, Miliband’s theory of the state is considered synonymous with the concept of institutional colonization. This misrepresentation of Miliband’s analysis has wildly exaggerated his empirical claims about the direct domination of the state apparatuses by members of the capitalist class. Despite the importance of institutional colonization to Miliband’s (1969, 55) analysis, his empirical claims about the degree to which capitalists colonize the state apparatus were always circumscribed by his recognition that capitalists have not “assumed the major share of government” in most advanced capitalist democracies.6 For that reason, Miliband (1969, 59) argues that capitalists “are not, properly speaking, a ‘governing’ class, comparable to pre-industrial, aristocratic and landowning classes.”7 Indeed, a fact completely ignored by Miliband’s (1969, 55) critics is that he quotes Karl Kautsky to the effect that “the capitalist class reigns but does not govern.”8 The colonization of key command posts in selected state apparatuses is merely one weapon, albeit an important one, in the larger arsenal of ruling class domination. What Miliband (1969, 56, 48) actually claims is that capitalists are “well represented in the political executive and in other parts of the state system” and that their occupation of these key command posts enables them to exercise decisive influence over public policy.9 The fact that finance capitalists usually control the executive branch of government and the administrative-regulatory apparatuses is considered particularly important, under normal circumstances, for both historical and theoretical reasons. In historical terms, the political development of the modern state system has been marked mainly by the growth of its regulatory, administrative, and coercive institutions over the course of the last century. As these institutions have grown in size, numbers, and technical complexity, the state’s various subsystems have achieved greater autonomy from government in their operations. The growth of independent administrative and regulatory subsystems within the state has occurred as governments, especially legislatures, have found it increasingly difficult to maintain any central direction over the many components of the state system. The historical result is that the preponderance of state power has shifted from the legislative to the executive branch of government and to independent administrative or regulatory agencies. This development is theoretically important partly because the very basis of state power is concentrated in those institutions (i.e., administration, coercion, knowledge) and because it is those institutions that the capitalist class has colonized most successfully. Thus, the actual degree of state power that capitalists achieve by colonizing executive, administrative, and regulatory command posts has been magnified by the asymmetrical power structure within the contemporary state system, (e.g., in the United States by the imperial presidency and the emergence of independent regulatory agencies). This asymmetrical distribution of state power within the contemporary state form provides capitalists with strategic locations inside the state system from which to initiate, modify, and veto a broad range of policy proposals.10 Miliband recognizes that a potential weakness of this more limited claim is the fact that capitalists usually colonize only the top command posts of government and administration. The colonization process is clearly unable to explain the operational unity of the entire state system and, therefore, one must be able to identify the mechanism that leads a number of relatively autonomous and divergent state subsystems to operate as if they were a single entity called the state.11 Indeed, the loose connection of lower level career administrators to the state elite is indicated by Miliband’s description of them as servants of the state. In fact, these servants are frequently conceptualized as a separate professional-managerial class composed of lower and middle level career state managers (Ehrenreich and Ehrenreich, 1977).12 Miliband (1969, 119) observes that: The general pattern must be taken to be one in which these men [i.e. state managers] do play an important part in the process of governmental decision-making, and therefore constitute a considerable force in the configuration of political power in their societies. Likewise, a problem of systemic unity derives from the disparate organization of the contemporary state apparatus. To the extent that the state system is viewed as a web of decentered institutions, one must account for how the state elite and state managers are able to maintain some overarching interinstitutional cohesion that is “capitalist” in its content. Miliband has attempted to explain the coherence of the state system by suggesting that its operational unity is partly ideological. He argues that most state elites, including those who are not members of the capitalist class, “accept as beyond question the capitalist context in which they operate.” In Miliband’s (1969, 72, 75) account, the ideological commitments of state elites and state managers are of “absolutely fundamental importance in shaping their attitudes, policies and actions in regard to specific issues and problems with which they are confronted.” The result of their underlying ideological unity is that “the politics of advanced capitalism have been about different conceptions of how to run the same economic and social system.” Miliband (1969, 75) certainly recognizes that state elites and state managers in the various apparatuses, whether members of the capitalist class or not “wish, without a doubt, to pursue many ends, personal as well as public.” However, the underlying ideological unity of state elites and state managers means that “all other ends are conditioned by, and pass through the prism of, their acceptance of and commitment to the existing economic system.” Thus, in an observation that seems to anticipate Claus Offe’s (1975; 1984, 126) “dependency principle,” Miliband (1969, 75) observes that: … it is easy to understand why governments should wish to help business in every possible way. … For if the national interest is in fact inextricably bound up with the fortunes of capitalist enterprise, apparent partiality towards it is not really partiality at all. On the contrary, in serving the interests of business and in helping capitalist enterprise to thrive, governments are really fulfilling their exalted role as guardians of the good of all. Otherwise, as Miliband describes it, the modern state system in capitalist societies is a vast and sprawling network of political institutions loosely coordinated, if at all, through mechanisms that provide a tenuous cohesion at best. Importantly, for Miliband, the diffuseness of the state system in capitalist societies also means that the conquest of state power is never an all or nothing proposition, because it is—in the Gramscian phrase—a war of fixed position, waged on many fronts, in many trenches, with shifting lines of battle, where victories and successes occur side by side on the same day. The conquest of state power is never absolute; it is never uncontested; and it is never complete, because it is an on-going and contingent political struggle.13 Hence, Miliband’s concept of the state requires an analysis and understanding of state power that always refers to particular historical circumstances and to institutional configurations that may vary widely from one capitalist society to another, and where over time class hegemony may shift in one direction or another within the same society. Indeed, Miliband (1969, 77) is quite explicit in pointing out that state elites “have in fact been compelled over the years to act against some property rights, to erode some managerial prerogatives, to help redress somewhat the balance between capital and labour, between property and those who are subject to it.” ”翻译为中文","output":"什么是国家权力？ 因此，对于米尔班德来说，理论上重要的是要知道在任何特定时间谁实际上控制着国家权力。统治阶级控制的最直接指标之一是资本家阶级的成员在政府、行政、强制和其他机构中通过相互关联的职位控制国家机器的程度。米尔班德(1969, 54)强调: 正是这些机构拥有“国家权力”，并且正是通过这些机构的领导者，这些权力以其不同的表现形式被施加。 出于这个原因，米尔班德非常重视国家精英的社会组成。国家精英的阶级组成“强烈假定……关于其一般观点、意识形态倾向和政治偏见”，因此，量化特定阶级的成员在国家机器内的指挥岗位上不成比例地占据支配地位的程度，是衡量潜在阶级统治程度的一种方法（米尔班德，1969, 55）。在批评者看来，米尔班德对国家理论的看法被认为与机构殖民概念是同义的。这对米尔班德分析的误解极大地夸大了他对资本家阶级成员直接统治国家机器的经验主张。 尽管机构殖民对米尔班德（1969，55）的分析很重要，但他对资本家殖民国家机器程度的经验主张始终受到他认识到的限制，即资本家在大多数先进资本主义民主国家中并未“承担政府的主要份额”。因此，米尔班德（1969，59）认为，资本家“严格来说，不是一个‘统治’阶级，与前工业、贵族和土地所有阶级不相当。”实际上，米尔班德（1969，55）的批评者完全忽略了他引用卡尔·考茨基的话说，“资本家阶级统治但不治理。”在选定的国家机器内占据关键指挥岗位只是统治阶级主导地位中的一种武器，尽管它很重要。米尔班德（1969，56, 48）实际上声称，资本家“在政治执行机构和国家系统的其他部分得到了良好的代表”，并且他们占据这些关键指挥岗使他们能够对公共政策施加决定性影响。 财务资本家通常控制政府的行政部门和监管机构，在正常情况下，这被认为特别重要，有历史和理论上的原因。从历史上看，现代国家系统的政治发展主要是通过过去一个世纪对其监管、行政和强制机构的增长来标记的。随着这些机构在规模、数量和技术复杂性方面的增长，国家的各种子系统在运作中实现了相对于政府的更大自主性。独立的行政和监管子系统在国家内的增长发生在政府，特别是立法机关，越来越难以对国家系统的许多组成部分保持任何中央指导的同时。历史结果是，国家权力的重心已从立法机关转移到政府的行政机关和独立的行政或监管机构。 这一发展在理论上部分重要，因为国家权力的基础集中在那些机构（即行政、强制、知识），而这些机构是资本家阶级最成功地殖民的。因此，资本家通过殖民行政、行政和监管指挥岗位实现的实际国家权力程度，已被当代国家系统内不对称的权力结构所放大（例如，在美国由皇帝式总统制和独立监管机构的出现）。在当代国家形态中，权力在国家内的不对称分配为资本家提供了从国家系统内的战略位置发起、修改和否决广泛政策建议的能力。米尔班德认识到这一更有限主张的一个潜在弱点是事实，即资本家通常只殖民政府和行政的顶级指挥岗位。殖民过程显然无法解释整个国家系统的运作统一性，因此，必须能够识别使相对自治和多样的国家子系统像一个叫做国家的单一实体那样运作的机制。 实际上，米尔班德对低层次的职业管理员与国家精英之间松散联系的描述表明他将这些人视为国家的仆人。事实上，这些仆人经常被概念化为由低中层级职业国家经理组成的独立的专业管理阶级（Ehrenreich和Ehrenreich，1977）。米尔班德（1969，119）观察到： 一般模式必须被视为这些人[即国家经理]在政府决策过程中发挥重要作用，因此在他们社会政治力量的配置中构成了相当大的力量。 同样，系统统一性的问题源于当代国家机器的不同构造。在某种程度上，如果将国家系统视为去中心化机构的网络，则必须说明国家精英和国家经理如何能够维持某种超越机构的凝聚力，这种凝聚力在其内容上是“资本家”的。米尔班德试图通过暗示其运作统一性部分是意识形态的来解释国家系统的一致性。他认为，大多数国家精英，包括那些不是资本家阶级成员的人，都“无可质疑地接受了他们所在的资本主义环境。”在米尔班德（1969，72，75）的描述中，国家精英和国家经理的意识形态承诺在“塑造他们面对的特定问题和问题的态度、政策和行动方面具有绝对根本的重要性。”他们潜在意识形态统一的结果是，“先进资本主义的政治是关于如何运行同一经济和社会体系的不同概念的。” 米尔班德（1969，75）当然认识到，在各种机构中的国家精英和国家经理，无论是否属于资本家阶级，“毫无疑问，希望追求许多目标，个人的和公共的。”然而，国家精英和国家经理的潜在意识形态统一意味着“所有其他目标都受到他们对现有经济系统的接受和致力的制约。”因此，在一次观察中，似乎预示了克劳斯·奥费的（1975；1984，126）“依赖原则”，米尔班德（1969，75）观察到： “……很容易理解为什么政府希望以一切可能的方式帮助商业。……因为如果国家利益实际上与资本主义企业的命运密不可分，那么对它的明显偏袒实际上根本不是偏袒。相反，在为商业服务并帮助资本主义企业繁荣时，政府实际上是在履行它们作为所有人福祉守护者的崇高角色。” 此外，正如米尔班德所描述的，资本主义社会中的现代国家系统是一个庞大而杂乱的政治机构网络，如果有的话，仅通过提供最微弱的凝聚力的机制来松散协调。对米尔班德来说，资本主义社会中国家系统的分散性也意味着，征服国家权力从来不是一个全有或全无的命题，因为它是——用格拉西亚的说法——一个固定位置的战争，涉及许多战线，在许多战壕中进行，战线不断变化，胜利和成功在同一天并存。征服国家权力从未是绝对的；它从未不受争议；也永远不会完成，因为这是一场持续的、有条件的政治斗争。因此，米尔班德的国家概念需要对国家权力的分析和理解，这种分析和理解始终涉及特定的历史情况和可能在不同的资本主义社会之间广泛变化的制度配置，以及随着时间的推移，阶级霸权可能在同一社会内向一个或另一个方向转移。实际上，米尔班德（1969，77）在指出国家精英“实际上多年来被迫采取行动反对一些产权，侵蚀一些管理特权，帮助在资本和劳动之间、财产和受其支配者之间的平衡上有所调整”时非常明确。"},{"instruction":"请将“Poulantzas’ Theory of the State Nicos Poulantzas was relatively unknown to Anglo-American scholars until he initiated the Poulantzas-Miliband debate with his review of The State in Capitalist Society in late 1969 (Buchanan, 2010, 381). When Poulantzas informed readers that his critique of Miliband derived from epistemological positions presented more fully in his Pouvoir Politique et Classes Sociales (1968), the debate itself stimulated a demand for Poulantzas’ book, which was finally published in English in 1973.14 SOCIAL CLASS AND POLITICAL PRACTICE In Political Power and Social Classes, Poulantzas (1978a, 1–22) claims that every mode of production can be understood theoretically in terms of the functional interrelations between its economic, political, and ideological levels.15 Each level in a mode of production consists of structures, which tend to reproduce and stabilize the mode of production and class practices, which generate conflicts and contradictions within the mode of production (Poulantzas, 1978a, 37, 86). A structure consists of one or more institutions that fulfill specific economic, political, or ideological functions necessary to sustain a particular mode of production. For instance, the economic structure of a capitalist society is constituted primarily by the social relations of production as defined in Marx’s Capital.16 The political structures of a mode of production consist of the institutionalized power of the state (Poulantzas, 1978a, 42). The ideological structures of a mode of production refer both to the subjective consciousness of individual social actors and to the collective thought-systems that exist in a given society (Poulantzas, 1978a, 28–34; Therborn, 1980, 2). A stable social formation—that is, a social system in equilibrium—is one where the structures at each level function together as an integrated system to maintain and extend the dominant relations of production and, hence, the ability of a dominant class to appropriate surplus value from a subordinate laboring class. However, Poulantzas emphasizes that the normal functioning of structures within the capitalist mode of production generates contradictory class practices that simultaneously destabilize the conditions of ruling class domination. In Political Power and Social Classes, Poulantzas (1978a, 41) explains class practices as the effects of: (1) structural dislocations generated by class struggle and (2) the uneven development of structures between and within the levels of a social formation.17 In direct contrast to what he calls the “historicist conception” of class practice, Poulantzas (1978a, 66) argues that “relations of production as a structure are not social classes … capital and wage-labour are not, of course, the empirical realities of ‘capitalists’ and ‘labourers’.” Instead, for Poulantzas (1978a, 66), the relations of production: … consist of specific forms of combination of the agents of production and the means of production. This structure of relations of production “determines the places and functions occupied and adopted by the agents of production, who are never anything more than the occupants of these places, in so far as they are supports of these functions.” Thus, Poulantzas can never regard the main tasks of Marxist political theory as empirical or historical, because such analyses in his framework confuse the agents of production (i.e., groups of individuals) with the structural-functional relations that determine social class. Individuals “support” and “carry out” various functions within temporal history, but these functions are in no way dependent upon particular individuals or groups of individuals. Hence, even before the publication of Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society, Poulantzas (1978a, 62) was dismissing the historicist conception of class practice as one that: … leads ultimately to the establishment of an ideological relation between individuals/agents-of-production (“men”) and social classes; this relation is given a theoretical foundation in the status of the subject. Agents of production are perceived as agents/producers, as subjects which create structures; and social classes are perceived as the subjects of history. Poulantzas (1978a, 62) finds the historicist conception of class practice theoretically flawed because it “fails to recognize two essential facts: firstly, that the agents of production, for example the wage-earning labourer and the capitalist, as ‘personifications’ of Wage-Labour and Capital, are considered by Marx as the supports or bearers of an ensemble of structures; secondly, that social classes are never theoretically conceived by Marx as the genetic origin of structures.” Consequently, Poulantzas (1978a, 67–68) contends that “social class is a concept which shows the effects of the ensemble of structures, of the matrix of a mode of production or of a social formation on the agents which constitute its supports.” Social classes are structural effects, which mediate between structures (e.g., relations of production) and class practices (e.g., trade unionism). Indeed, according to Poulantzas (1978a, 86), “social classes are conceivable only in terms of class practices” and it is these practices which determine agency, not vice versa.18 Importantly, Poulantzas (1978a, 86) views the identification of specific class practices as synonymous with the concept of “contradiction” because “class practices can be analysed only as conflicting practices in the field of class struggle … for example, the contradiction between those practices which aim at the realization of profit and those which aim at the increase of wages.” In other words, it is impossible to understand the structural place of working class practices that aim to increase wages without taking into consideration how such aims contradict capitalist class practices that aim to realize higher and higher profits. In this example, capitalist and proletarian class practices are each produced as the contradictory structural effect of relations of production on the agents of production (who merely carry out and support these practices within the capitalist system). Certainly, one can find explicit textual support for this claim in Marx’s Capital and such a reading is perfectly consistent with the theoretical status accorded to that work by Poulantzas and other structuralists.19 Yet, the importance of class practices in mediating between structure and history in Poulantzas’ political theory raises some difficult and immanent epistemological issues. This is because Poulantzas (1978a, 41) equates “the political” with class practices and, thus, he defines the specific object of politics as “the ‘present moment’ (as Lenin said), i.e., the nodal point where the contradictions of the various levels of a formation are condensed in the complex relations governed by over-determination and by their dislocation and uneven development.” The epistemological difficulty for Poulantzas (1978a, 37) is that if the specific object of the political is the present moment, then “the problem of the political and politics is linked to the problem of history.” As noted earlier, Poulantzas argues that the “the problems of the general Marxist theory of the state and of the political class struggle” are addressed in a group of “political texts” by Marx, Engels, and Lenin that complement one’s reading of Capital. Interestingly, the critical text forging an explicit theoretical nexus between structure and history is the Communist Manifesto; namely, the single most significant text that Poulantzas does not include on his list of “Marxian classics” in political theory. Yet, at a crucial point in the development of his argument, Poulantzas (1978a, 37) introduces two propositions from the Communist Manifesto to provide a theoretical nexus between class practices and history: “(a) ‘Every class struggle is a political struggle’, and (b) ‘The class struggle is the motive force of history’.” Poulantzas never mentions that passage on the state emphasized so heavily by Miliband, but he does recognize that it is “possible to make a historicist reading” of the Communist Manifesto. In fact, to preempt such a reading, Poulantzas engages in a running polemic against “Marxist historicism” throughout Political Power and Social Classes and, after publication of The State in Capitalist Society, Poulantzas immediately identified Miliband as an exemplar of Marxist historicism. Significantly, Poulantzas (1978, 37–38) never challenges Miliband’s “first reading” of the Communist Manifesto, as such, but instead questions the effects of such a reading on political practice as leading “to the ideological invariant voluntarism/economism and to the various forms of revisionism, reformism, spontaneism, etc.” Yet, as if to compound the difficulty, Poulantzas (1978, 39), like Miliband, turns to Gramsci in addressing questions of the political only to find that Gramsci’s views are “often tainted by the historicism of Croce and Labriola.”20 ”翻译为中文","output":"保兰察斯的国家理论 直到1969年晚些时候，他通过对《资本主义社会中的国家》的评论发起了保兰察斯-米尔班德辩论，尼科斯·保兰察斯对英美学者来说还相对不为人知（Buchanan，2010，381）。当保兰察斯告诉读者他对米尔班德的批判源自于他在其《政治权力与社会阶级》（1968）中更全面地提出的认识论立场时，这场辩论本身激发了人们对保兰察斯书籍的需求，该书最终于1973年以英语出版。 社会阶级与政治实践 在《政治权力与社会阶级》中，保兰察斯（1978a，1-22）声称，每一种生产方式都可以从其经济、政治和意识形态层面之间的功能性相互关系理论上理解。每一种生产方式中的每个层级由结构组成，这些结构倾向于再生产并稳定生产方式和阶级实践，这些实践在生产方式内部产生冲突和矛盾（保兰察斯，1978a，37，86）。一个结构由一个或多个机构组成，这些机构完成特定的、为维持特定生产方式所必需的经济、政治或意识形态功能。例如，资本主义社会的经济结构主要由马克思在《资本论》中界定的生产社会关系构成。生产方式的政治结构由国家的制度化权力构成（保兰察斯，1978a，42）。生产方式的意识形态结构既指个别社会行为者的主观意识，也指给定社会中存在的集体思维体系（保兰察斯，1978a，28-34；Therborn，1980，2）。一个稳定的社会形态——即一个平衡的社会系统——是指每个层级的结构作为一个整体一起功能，以维持和扩展主导的生产关系以及因此主导阶级从从属的劳动阶级那里获取剩余价值的能力。 然而，保兰察斯强调，资本主义生产方式内部结构的正常运作产生了矛盾的阶级实践，这些实践同时破坏了统治阶级统治的条件。在《政治权力与社会阶级》中，保兰察斯（1978a，41）将阶级实践解释为：（1）由阶级斗争产生的结构错位和（2）社会形态各层级之间及其内部结构的不均匀发展的结果。与他所说的“历史主义概念”相反，保兰察斯（1978a，66）认为“作为结构的生产关系不是社会阶级……资本和工资劳动当然不是‘资本家’和‘劳工’的经验现实。”相反，对于保兰察斯（1978a，66）而言，生产关系： …包含生产要素与生产手段的特定形式的结合。这种生产关系结构“决定了生产要素所占据和采用的位置和功能，这些要素仅仅是这些位置的占有者，因为它们是这些功能的支持者。” 因此，保兰察斯绝不会把马克思主义政治理论的主要任务视为经验或历史的，因为在他的框架内，这种分析将生产要素（即个体群体）与决定社会阶级的结构功能关系混为一谈。个人“支持”和“执行”历史中的各种功能，但这些功能绝不依赖于特定个人或个人群体。因此，甚至在《资本主义社会中的国家》出版之前，保兰察斯（1978a，62）就已经将历史主义的阶级实践观点视为一种： …最终建立起个体/生产要素之间的意识形态关系（“人”）与社会阶级之间的理论基础为主体地位。生产要素被视为代理人/生产者，作为创造结构的主体；社会阶级被视为历史的主体。 保兰察斯（1978a，62）认为历史主义的阶级实践观念在理论上是有缺陷的，因为它“未能认识到两个基本事实：首先，生产要素，例如领取工资的劳动者和资本家，作为工资劳动和资本的‘人格化’，被马克思视为结构整体的支持者或承担者；其次，社会阶级从未被马克思理论上视为结构的基因起源。”因此，保兰察斯（1978a，67-68）认为“社会阶级是一个概念，显示了一整套结构的效应，显示了一种生产方式或社会形态的矩阵对构成其支持的要素的影响。”社会阶级是结构效应，它介于结构（例如，生产关系）和阶级实践（例如，工会主义）之间。事实上，根据保兰察斯（1978a，86）的说法，“社会阶级只能以阶级实践的术语来理解”，而正是这些实践决定了代理性，而不是相反。 重要的是，保兰察斯（1978a，86）将特定阶级实践的识别视为与“矛盾”概念同义，因为“阶级实践只能作为阶级斗争领域中的冲突实践分析……例如，旨在实现利润的实践与旨在增加工资的实践之间的矛盾。”换句话说，如果不考虑这种目标如何与旨在实现越来越高利润的资本家阶级实践相矛盾，就不可能理解旨在增加工资的工人阶级实践在结构上的位置。在这个例子中，资本家和无产者阶级的实践都被生产如生产关系对生产要素的矛盾结构效应（这些要素仅在资本主义系统中承担和支持这些实践）。当然，在马克思的《资本论》中可以找到对这一主张的明确文本支持，这种解读与保兰察斯和其他结构主义者赋予该作品的理论地位完全一致。 然而，阶级实践在介于结构和历史之间发挥作用的重要性，为保兰察斯的政治理论提出了一些困难和内在的认识论问题。这是因为保兰察斯（1978a，41）将“政治”等同于阶级实践，因此，他将政治的具体对象定义为“‘当前时刻’（正如列宁所说），即，各层次矛盾在由过度决定和它们的错位及不均匀发展所统治的复杂关系中凝结的节点。”对于保兰察斯（1978a，37）来说，认识论难题在于，如果政治的具体对象是当前时刻，那么“政治和政治问题就与历史问题相关联。” 如前所述，保兰察斯认为，“马克思主义国家理论和政治阶级斗争的问题”在马克思、恩格斯和列宁的一组“政治文本”中得到了讨论，这些建议读者通过阅读《资本论》来补充。有趣的是，构建结构与历史之间明确理论联系的关键文本是《共产党宣言》；即，保兰察斯没有在政治理论中的“马克思主义经典”列表上包括的最重要的文本。然而，在其论点发展的关键时刻，保兰察斯（1978a，37）引入《共产党宣言》中的两个命题来提供阶级实践和历史之间的理论联系：“（a）‘每一次阶级斗争都是一场政治斗争’，和（b）‘阶级斗争是历史的动力’。” 保兰察斯没有提及米尔班德如此强调的有关国家的那段话，但他确实认识到“可能对《共产党宣言》做出历史主义解读”。事实上，为了预防这样的解读，保兰察斯在《政治权力与社会阶级》中一直与“马克思主义历史主义”进行抨击，并且在《资本主义社会中的国家》出版后，保兰察斯立即将米尔班德确定为马克思主义历史主义的典型例子。值得注意的是，保兰察斯（1978，37-38）从未质疑米尔班德对《共产党宣言》的“初步阅读”，但却质疑这样的阅读对政治实践的影响，认为它“导致意识形态不变的自愿主义/经济主义和各种形式的修正主义、改良主义、自发主义等。”然而，如果增加难度，保兰察斯（1978，39），像米尔班德一样，在处理政治问题时转向格拉西，只是发现格拉西的观点“经常被克罗齐和拉布里奥拉的历史主义所污染。”"},{"instruction":"请将“WHAT IS THE STATE? The contradictory effects of class practices on the equilibrium of the capitalist system means that immanent crisis tendencies are always disrupting the functional stability of the capitalist mode of production. Thus, the basic structure of the capitalist mode of production generates contradictory class practices, dislocations, and crisis tendencies, and it this inexorable disruption of the capitalist system that necessitates a separate structure to specifically maintain, monitor, and restore its equilibrium as a system. Although Poulantzas (1978, 45) modifies structural-functionalism by introducing class practices as a disequilibrating mechanism, nevertheless, he was clearly indebted to mainstream American functionalists and systems theorists insofar as he argues that the general function of the state in the capitalist mode of production is to serve as “the regulating factor of its global equilibrium as a system.”21 In particular, Poulantzas identifies three ensembles of class practices that require regulation by the state in order to maintain and restore the equilibrium of the capitalist system. First, Poulantzas argues contrary to the mythology of neo-classical economic theory, that the economic level of the capitalist mode of production has never “formed a hermetically sealed level, capable of self-production and possessing its own ‘laws’ of internal functioning.” Rather, the economic level of the capitalist mode of production is only relatively autonomous from the political and ideological levels, but given this relative autonomy, Poulantzas (1978, 45) concludes that structural “equilibrium is never given by the economic as such, but is maintained by the state.” To this extent, the state fulfills a general maintenance function “by constituting the factor of cohesion between the levels of a social formation” (Poulantzas 1978a, 44).22 Consequently, Poulantzas (1980, 17) identifies a second ensemble of class practices, constituted by the fact that “the political field of the State (as well as the sphere of ideology) has always, in different forms, been present in the constitution and reproduction of the relations of production.” Capitalist relations of production do not appear ex nihilo in history, nor do they reproduce themselves on a day-to-day basis without struggle and resistance on the part of subordinate classes whose labor is exploited by the capitalist class. Hence, in maintaining the cohesion of the levels of a social formation, Poulantzas (1978a, 52) observes that “the function of the state primarily concerns the economic level, and particularly the labour process, the productivity of labour.”23 This claim appears numerous times in Political Power and Social Classes and the claim is reiterated in both Classes in Contemporary Capitalism and State, Power, Socialism.24 Despite the evident importance of this function, Poulantzas (1978a, 53) also notes that “this function of the state as organizer of the labour process is only one aspect of its economic function.” The state also establishes and enforces the rules which organize capitalist exchanges (property and contract law, enforcement, punishment) and it functions to organize labor through its role of education, teaching, and so on. Finally, Poulantzas calls attention to an ensemble of class practices which occur “at the strictly political level” of the capitalist mode of production. Poulantzas (1978a, 53) identifies the strictly political function of the state with “the maintenance of political order in political class conflict.” By maintaining political order, by punishing disorder, and by monitoring political “subversion,” the state represses revolution and revolt and, thereby, maintains conditions of exploitation under the neutral guise of “law and order.” The operational objectives of state policy are realized through three “modalities of the state function.” The modalities of the state function identify the structural levels in which the effects of state policies are realized: (1) the technico-economic function at the economic level, (2) the political function at the level of class struggle, and (3) the ideological function at the cultural level. Regardless of the level at which the state’s modalities are effected, however, Poulantzas contends that the state function is always oriented “with particular reference to the productivity of labor.”25 The modalities of the state function are always implemented through three functional subsystems of the state: the judicial subsystem, the ideological subsystem, and the political subsystem. Poulantzas (1978a, 50, 53) argues that in capitalist societies the judicial subsystem is constituted as a set of rules, which facilitate market exchanges by providing a “framework of cohesion in which commercial encounters can take place,” (e.g., property and contract law, fair business practices). The state’s ideological subsystem functions primarily through public educational institutions, while the strictly political subsystem consists of institutions engaged in “the maintenance of political order in political class conflict” (e.g., electoral laws, the party system, police, bureaucracy).26 The state’s modalities each constitute political functions insofar as their operational objective is the maintenance and stabilization of a society in which the capitalist class is the dominant and exploitative class. As Poulantzas (1978a, 54) notes: … the state’s economic or ideological functions correspond to the political interests of the dominant class and constitute political functions, not simply in those cases where there is a direct and obvious relation between (a) the organization of labour and education and (b) the political domination of a class, but also where the object of these functions is the maintenance of the unity of the formation, inside which this class is the politically dominant class. It is to the extent that the prime object of these functions is the maintenance of this unity that they [i.e., the functions and their modalities] correspond to the political interests of the dominant class. It should be emphasized as a point of considerable theoretical significance that structures (i.e., the levels of the capitalist mode of production) are not reducible to the economic, political, or ideological institutions that compose them.27 On this point, David Gold, Clarence Lo, and Erik Olin Wright (1975, 36 fn.) observe that for Poulantzas the concept of “structure does not refer to the concrete social institutions that make up a society, but rather to the systematic functional interrelationships among these institutions.” Hence, Poulantzas’ structural analysis always emphasized “the functional relationship of various institutions to the process of surplus-value production and appropriation,”28 whereas Miliband tends to emphasize the empirical organization, operation, and control of particular institutions. WHAT IS STATE POWER? The differences between Miliband and Poulantzas concerning the importance of institutions initially appear to be much more than a mere difference in emphasis or theoretical focus. Miliband and Poulantzas each articulate competing concepts of state power that are linked inextricably to their methodological differences. Whereas Miliband articulates an institutionalist conception of power, anchored by the methodological (Weberian) assumptions of power structure research, Poulantzas articulates a functionalist conception of power anchored by the methodological (Parsonian) assumptions of systems analysis and structural functionalism. Notably, and in direct contrast to Miliband, Poulantzas draws a sharp analytic distinction between the concepts of state power and the state apparatus (Therborn, 1978, 148). Poulantzas (1978a, 104) defines state power as the capacity of a social class to realize its objective interests through the state apparatus. Bob Jessop (1982, 221) lends greater specificity to this idea by observing that within this framework “state power is capitalist to the extent that it creates, maintains, or restores the conditions required for capital accumulation in a given situation and it is non-capitalist to the extent these conditions are not realised.” In this respect, the objective effects of state policies on capital accumulation and the class structure are the main objective indicators of state power.29 On the other hand, the state apparatus is identified with two relations that are analytically (though not functionally) distinct from state power. Poulantzas (1978a, 116) defines the state apparatus as: “(a) The place of the state in the ensemble of the structures of a social formation,” that is, the state’s functions and “(b) The personnel of the state, the ranks of the administration, bureaucracy, army, etc.” The state apparatus is thus a unity of the effects of state power (i.e., policies) and the network of institutions and personnel through which the state function is executed.30 The functional unity between state power and the state apparatus in emphasized by Poulantzas (1978a, 115 fn. 24) with the observation “that structure is not the simple principle of organization which is exterior to the institution: the structure is present in an allusive and inverted form in the institution itself.” For Poulantzas (1978a, 115), the concept of the state apparatus intrinsically includes the functions executed through state institutions and by state personnel. Hence, in direct contrast to Miliband, Poulantzas insists that “the institutions of the state, do not, strictly speaking, have any power. Institutions, considered from the point of view of power, can be related only to social classes which hold power.”31 State institutions are political arenas for the exercise of class power and exist as such only by virtue of their functional role in the capitalist mode of production (Poulantzas, 1978a, 115).32 ”翻译为中文","output":"什么是国家？ 阶级实践对资本主义体系平衡的矛盾效应意味着，固有的危机倾向始终在破坏资本主义生产方式的功能稳定性。因此，资本主义生产方式的基本结构产生矛盾的阶级实践、错位和危机倾向，正是这种不可避免的资本主义体系的破坏，使得一个独立的结构特别需要维护、监控并恢复其系统平衡。尽管保兰察斯（1978, 45）通过引入阶级实践作为失衡机制来修改结构功能主义，但他显然亏欠于主流美国功能主义者和系统理论家，因为他认为，国家在资本主义生产方式中的一般功能是作为“其作为系统的全局平衡的调节因素”。21 特别地，保兰察斯确定了三组需要国家调节以维持和恢复资本主义体系平衡的阶级实践。首先，保兰察斯认为，与新古典经济理论的神话相反，资本主义生产方式的经济层面从未“形成一个密封等级，能够自我生产并拥有其内部运作的‘规律’”。相反，资本主义生产方式的经济层面只是相对独立于政治和意识形态层面，但鉴于这种相对自治，保兰察斯(1978, 45)得出结构“平衡从不由经济本身给出，而是由国家维持”。在这种程度上，国家通过“构成社会形态各层面之间的凝聚因素”（保兰察斯 1978a, 44）履行了一般维护功能。22 因此，保兰察斯（1980, 17）确定了第二组阶级实践，由这样一个事实构成：“国家的政治领域（以及意识形态领域）总是以不同形式出现在生产关系的构建和再生产中。”资本主义生产关系并非在历史中凭空出现，也不是在没有从属阶级的斗争和抵抗的情况下日复一日地自我再生产，这些从属阶级的劳动被资本家阶级剥削。因此，在维持社会形态各层面的凝聚力时，保兰察斯（1978a, 52）观察到“国家的功能主要关注经济层面，特别是劳动过程，劳动生产率。”23 这个观点在《政治权力与社会阶级》中多次出现，并且在《当代资本主义中的阶级》和《国家、权力、社会主义》中反复强调。24 尽管这个功能的重要性显而易见，保兰察斯（1978a, 53）也指出：“国家作为劳动过程组织者的这一功能只是其经济功能的一个方面。”国家还确立并执行组织资本主义交换的规则（财产和合同法、执行、惩罚），并通过其在教育、教学等方面的作用来组织劳动。最后，保兰察斯关注发生在资本主义生产方式的“纯粹政治层面”的阶级实践。保兰察斯（1978a, 53）将国家的严格政治功能与“在政治阶级冲突中维持政治秩序”相对应。通过维护政治秩序，惩治混乱，并通过监控政治“颠覆”，国家压制革命和叛乱，从而在“法律与秩序”的中立幌子下维持剥削条件。 国家政策的运作目标通过三种“国家职能的方式”实现。国家职能的方式确定了国家政策效果实现的结构层次：（1）经济层面的技术-经济功能，（2）阶级斗争层面的政治功能，（3）文化层面的意识形态功能。然而，无论国家的方式在何种层次上发挥效果，保兰察斯均认为，国家职能总是“特别关注劳动生产率”。25 国家职能的方式总是通过国家的三个功能子系统实施：司法子系统、意识形态子系统和政治子系统。保兰察斯（1978a, 50, 53）认为，在资本主义社会中，司法子系统构成为一组规则，这些规则通过提供“商业交往发生的凝聚框架”（例如，财产和合同法、公平商业实践）来促进市场交换。国家的意识形态子系统主要通过公共教育机构发挥作用，而严格的政治子系统则包括从事“在政治阶级冲突中维持政治秩序”的机构（例如，选举法、党派制度、警察、官僚体系）。26 国家的各种方式都构成政治功能，因为它们的运作目标是维护和稳定一个资本家阶级是占主导地位和剥削阶级的社会。正如保兰察斯（1978a, 54）指出的： …国家的经济或意识形态功能符合主导阶级的政治利益，并构成政治功能，不仅在劳动和教育的组织与一个阶级的政治统治之间有直接和明显关系的情况下，还包括这些功能的目标是维持统一性的情况下，内部这个阶级是政治上占主导的阶级。这些功能[即，功能及其方式]符合主导阶级的政治利益，是因为它们的首要目标是维持这种统一性。 应该强调的一个具有相当理论意义的观点是，结构（即，资本主义生产方式的层级）不能简化为构成它们的经济、政治或意识形态机构。27 在这一点上，大卫·戈尔德、克拉伦斯·洛和埃里克·奥林·赖特（1975, 36 fn.）指出，对于保兰察斯来说，“结构”一词不是指构成一个社会的具体社会机构，而是指这些机构之间的系统功能性相互关系。因此，保兰察斯的结构分析总是强调“各种机构对剩余价值生产和占有过程的功能性关系”，而米尔班德倾向于强调特定机构的实证组织、运作和控制。 什么是国家权力？ 米尔班德和保兰察斯对机构重要性的不同看法，最初似乎不仅仅是强调或理论重点的区别。米尔班德和保兰察斯各自阐述了与他们的方法论差异密切相关的竞争性国家权力概念。米尔班德表达了一种以方法论（韦伯式）权力结构研究的假设为基础的制度主义权力概念，而保兰察斯表达了一种以系统分析和结构功能主义的方法论（帕森斯式）假设为基础的功能主义权力概念。值得注意的是，与米尔班德形成直接对比的是，保兰察斯在国家权力和国家机器的概念之间划出了明显的分析区别（Therborn, 1978, 148）。 保兰察斯（1978a, 104）将国家权力定义为社会阶级通过国家机器实现其客观利益的能力。鲍勃·杰索普（1982, 221）通过观察在这一框架内“国家权力是资本主义的，因为它创造、维护或恢复给定情况下资本积累所需的条件，而它是非资本主义的，因为这些条件没有实现”，为这一概念提供了更具体的说明。在这方面，国家政策对资本积累和阶级结构的客观效应是国家权力的主要客观指标。29 另一方面，国家机器与（分析上虽然不是功能上）与国家权力有区别的两种关系相关联。保兰察斯（1978a, 116）将国家机器定义为：“（a）国家在社会形态结构体系中的位置，即国家的职能和（b）国家人员，行政、官僚体系、军队等的行列。”国家机器因此是国家权力（即政策）效应和执行国家职能的机构和人员网络的统一体。30 保兰察斯（1978a, 115 fn. 24）通过观察“结构不是外在于机构的简单组织原则：结构以一种隐晦和颠倒的形式存在于机构本身中”来强调国家权力和国家机器之间的功能统一。对于保兰察斯（1978a, 115）来说，国家机器的概念固有地包括通过国家机构和国家人员执行的职能。因此，与米尔班德形成直接对比的是，保兰察斯坚持认为“严格地说，国家机构没有任何权力。从权力的角度来看，机构只能与掌握权力的社会阶级相关。”31 国家机构是阶级权力行使的政治舞台，只有通过其在资本主义生产方式中的功能性角色，才能作为这样的存在（保兰察斯，1978a, 115）。32"},{"instruction":"请将“The First Exchange: The Problem of Method From the outset of their critical exchange, Poulantzas focused the debate on “the problem of method” in Marxist political theory. As a result, and as I have suggested earlier, even though the Poulantzas-Miliband debate has generally been viewed as a contest between instrumentalist and structuralist theories of the state, it was actually more about methodology than about state theory. Notably, Poulantzas praises Miliband for methodically attacking bourgeois conceptions of the state and political power by rigorously deploying a formidable array of empirical data to challenge the dogmatic assertions of pluralist theory. Poulantzas (1969, 69) acknowledges that Miliband’s empirical methodological approach had enabled him to “radically demolish” bourgeois ideologies of the State and to provide Marxists “with a positive knowledge that these ideologies have never been able to produce.” For Poulantzas (1969, 73), this means that Miliband’s work functions as an ideology critique and that its political value is its ideological effect in demystifying the claims of bourgeois social science.33 However, as an ideology critique that demystifies bourgeois conceptions of the state and political power, it does not thereby elaborate a Marxist theory of the state. Ideology critique does not go far enough in challenging the dominance of bourgeois conceptions because, in Poulantzas’ view, it is never sufficient to juxtapose empirical facts against theoretical concepts. The concepts themselves must be attacked at a philosophical and theoretical level with other “concepts situated in a different problematic.” Instead of merely demystifying bourgeois ideology from within its own problematic, Poulantzas (1969, 69) insists that it is necessary to displace that epistemological terrain and Poulantzas claims that “Miliband appears to omit this first step.”34 Poulantzas is not content with an analysis that empirically demystifies the concept of a plural elite, for example; he insists that one must reject the very concepts of bourgeois social science and replace them with “the scientific concepts of Marxist theory.” This is because empirical facts only become “concrete” by having a new theoretical meaning conferred on them by their place within a radical theory constituted as an epistemological break with bourgeois social science. Poulantzas insists that epistemology and theory construction must precede ideology critique for two reasons. First, ideology critique employs the theoretical concepts of an ideological adversary and, in using these concepts, Poulantzas (1969, 70) is certain that “one legitimizes them and permits their persistence.” Hence, even the limited objectives of an ideology critique are vitiated by a self-defeating exercise that strengthens one’s adversary. Second, Poulantzas is concerned about the risk of being “unconsciously and surreptitiously contaminated by the very epistemological principles of the adversary.” Although Poulantzas initially agrees that Miliband’s methodological procedures have not taken him too far down that path, Poulantzas does caution that “Miliband sometimes allows himself to be unduly influenced by the methodological principles of the adversary,” that is, bourgeois social scientists. Poulantzas identifies several specific instances where he believes that Miliband’s methodology led him astray theoretically: (1) the problem of the subject, (2) the problem of state cohesion, (3) the problem of ideological apparatuses. If this series of so-called problematics shaped the direction of Marxist political theory for the next decade, it is the Poulantzas-Miliband debate which defined the frontiers and boundaries of those explorations. THE PROBLEM OF THE SUBJECT Poulantzas (1969, 70–71) defines the problem of the subject as “a problematic of social actors, of individuals as the origin of social action.” If individuals or groups of individuals are considered as social actors, then Poulantzas argues that theoretical research is diverted from “the study of the objective co-ordinates that determine the distribution of agents into social classes and the contradictions between these classes … to the search for finalist explanations founded on the motivations of conduct of the individual actors.” Poulantzas claims that Miliband’s empirical and institutional analysis of states in capitalist societies “constantly gives the impression” that “social classes or ‘groups’ are in some way reducible to inter-personal relations, that the State is reducible to inter-personal relations of the members of the diverse ‘groups’ that constitute the State apparatus, and finally that the relation between social classes and the State is itself reducible to inter-personal relations of ‘individuals’ composing social groups and ‘individuals’ composing the State apparatus.” Consequently, Poulantzas chastises Miliband for offering explanations of corporate behavior, the state elite, and state managers that are “founded on the motivations of conduct of the individual actors.” Poulantzas contends that this method of analysis vitiates Miliband’s ideology critique to the extent that he fails to comprehend “social classes and the State as objective structures, and their relations as an objective system of regular connections, a structure and a system whose agents, ‘men’, are in the words of Marx, ‘bearers’ of it.” Otherwise, Poulantzas is concerned that “to transpose this problematic of the subject into Marxism is in the end to admit the epistemological principles of the adversary.” Interestingly, in an earlier essay, also published in the New Left Review, Poulantzas (1967) argues that the problem of the subject is a theoretical error endemic to Anglo-American Marxism in general and so in many ways his critique of Miliband merely serves to illuminate his assessment of a widespread theoretical shortcoming within the Anglo-American left. THE PROBLEM OF STATE COHESION According to Poulantzas, this same problem of the subject resurfaces in Miliband’s treatment of the state bureaucracy, the army, regulatory agencies, and other personnel of the state system. The problem appears in the fact that Miliband places so much emphasis on the role of ideology in linking these agents to the capitalist class and the top state elite, because this explanatory mechanism suggests that the criterion for membership in a particular class is the shared motivations and subjective orientations of a group of individuals. Hence, Poulantzas (1969, 73) concludes that Miliband “seems to reduce the role of the State to the conduct and ‘behavior’ of the members of the State apparatus.” Poulantzas (1969, 71), of course, insists that Marx’s criterion for the designation of class boundaries is “the objective place in production and the ownership of the means of production.” Instead, Poulantzas (1969, 73) proposes that civil servants, military officers, regulators, and other state managers are “a specific social category—not a class. This means that, although the members of the State apparatus belong, by their class origin to different classes, they function according to a specific internal unity.” A social category’s “internal unity derives from its actualization of the objective role of the State” (Poulantzas, 1969, 74). Therefore, Poulantzas (1969, 73) claims in a now legendary passage that: … the direct participation of members of the capitalist class in the State apparatus and in the government, even where it exists, is not the important side of the matter. The relation between the bourgeois class and the State is an objective relation. This means that if the function of the state in a determinate social formation and the interests of the dominant class in this formation coincide, it is by reason of the system itself: the direct participation of members of the ruling class in the state apparatus is not the cause but the effect, and moreover a chance and contingent one, of this objective coincidence. Although Poulantzas insists that the state as a whole, as an objective system of power, is relatively autonomous from the dominant class, the state’s internal unity requires that we not view its individual apparatuses and personnel as relatively autonomous. Rather, it is the general function of the state that gives cohesion and unity to the apparatuses and personnel and which make it possible to refer both to a state and to the capitalist state. However, from Poulantzas’ perspective, Miliband relies on factors “exterior” to the state itself and, therefore, he lacks a theoretical capacity to conceptualize the necessary unity and cohesion of the state. In contrast, Poulantzas (1969, 77) insists that “the State in the classic Marxist sense of the term, possesses a very rigorous internal unity which directly governs the relation between the diverse branches of the apparatus.” THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGICAL APPARATUSES Poulantzas was not inclined to dismiss ideology altogether, but instead he proposes to reconceptualize its production and distribution within a Marxist theory of the state. Poulantzas (1969, 76–77) was quite correct to point out that “the classic Marxist tradition of the theory of the State is principally concerned to show the repressive role of the State, in the strong sense of organized physical repression.” On the other hand, ideology had been dismissed as epiphenomenal (rather than constitutive) of social and political relations, mainly because ideology had been equated “with ideas, customs or morals without seeing that ideology can be embodied, in the strong sense, in institutions: institutions which then, by the very process of institutionalization, belong to the system of the State.” Poulantzas proposes that the realm of ideology be brought inside the state by reconceptualizing the state as a dual matrix of apparatuses that either perform repressive functions or ideological functions.35 Poulantzas defines the state ideological apparatuses to include churches, political parties, trade unions, schools and universities, the press, television, radio, and even the family.”翻译为中文","output":"第一次交流：方法论问题 在他们的批判性交流一开始，保兰察斯把辩论聚焦在马克思主义政治理论中的“方法论问题”上。结果，正如我之前所述，尽管保兰察斯-米尔班德辩论通常被视为工具主义和结构主义国家理论之间的较量，实际上更多的是关于方法论而非国家理论。值得注意的是，保兰察斯赞扬米尔班德以系统的方式攻击资产阶级国家和政治权力的概念，通过严谨地部署大量的实证数据挑战多元主义理论的教条式断言。保兰察斯（1969, 69）承认米尔班德的实证方法论方法使他能够“从根本上摧毁”资产阶级的国家意识形态，并为马克思主义者提供了这些意识形态从未能够产生的积极知识。对保兰察斯（1969, 73）来说，这意味着米尔班德的作品作为一种意识形态批判发挥作用，其政治价值在于其在揭露资产阶级社会科学主张方面的意识形态效应。33 然而，作为一种揭露资产阶级国家和政治权力概念的意识形态批判，它并没有进而阐述一种马克思主义国家理论。意识形态批判在挑战资产阶级概念的主导地位方面还远远不够，因为在保兰察斯看来，仅仅将经验事实与理论概念对立起来是不够的。概念本身必须在哲学和理论层面上被攻击，用置于不同问题域中的其他“概念”来攻击它们。保兰察斯（1969, 69）坚持认为，必须转移那个认识论领域，而不仅仅是在其自身的问题域内揭露资产阶级意识形态，并声称“米尔班德似乎忽略了这一第一步。”34保兰察斯对仅仅实证地揭露如多元精英概念等资产阶级社会科学概念并不满足；他坚持认为，必须拒绝资产阶级社会科学的概念，并用“马克思主义理论的科学概念”来取代它们。这是因为，实证事实只有通过被置于一个与资产阶级社会科学形成认识论断裂的激进理论中，获得新的理论意义后才变得“具体”。 保兰察斯坚持认为，认识论和理论构建必须先于意识形态批判，原因有二。首先，意识形态批判采用了意识形态对手的理论概念，并且在使用这些概念时，保兰察斯（1969, 70）确信“这赋予了它们合法性并允许它们的持续存在。”因此，即使意识形态批判的有限目标也被一种加强对手的自我挫败行为所削弱。其次，保兰察斯担心存在“无意识和悄然被对手的认识论原则所污染”的风险。尽管保兰察斯最初同意米尔班德的方法论程序并没有让他走得太远，但保兰察斯确实警告说“米尔班德有时让自己过多地受到对手的方法论原则的影响”，即资产阶级社会科学家。保兰察斯指出了几个具体的实例，他认为米尔班德的方法论在理论上将他引入歧途：（1）主体问题，（2）国家凝聚力问题，（3）意识形态机构问题。如果这一系列所谓的问题塑造了未来十年马克思主义政治理论的方向，那么保兰察斯-米尔班德辩论定义了这些探索的前沿和边界。 主体问题 保兰察斯（1969, 70-71）将主体问题定义为“关于社会行动者、个体作为社会行动起源的问题域。”如果将个体或个体群体视为社会行动者，那么保兰察斯认为，理论研究就会被转移，“从研究决定代理人被分配到社会阶级中的客观坐标以及这些阶级之间的矛盾……转向寻找以个体行为者动机为基础的终极解释。”保兰察斯声称米尔班德对资本主义社会中国家的实证和制度分析“经常给人以印象”，认为“社会阶级或‘群体’在某种程度上可以还原为人际关系，国家可以还原为构成国家机器的不同‘群体’成员之间的人际关系，最终社会阶级与国家之间的关系本身可以还原为构成社会团体和国家机器的‘个体’之间的人际关系。”因此，保兰察斯批评米尔班德提供了基于个体行为者动机的公司行为、国家精英和国家经理的解释。保兰察斯认为，这种分析方法削弱了米尔班德的意识形态批判，因为他未能理解“社会阶级和国家作为客观结构，以及他们之间的关系作为一个客观系统的规律连接，一个结构和系统，其代理人，‘人’，用马克思的话来说，是它的‘承载者’。”此外，保兰察斯担心，“将这种主体问题转移进马克思主义最终等于承认对手的认识论原则。”有趣的是，在《新左评》上发表的一篇早期文章中，保兰察斯（1967）认为主体问题是普遍存在于一般盎格鲁-美国马克思主义的理论错误，因此在许多方面，他对米尔班德的批评只是为了阐明盎格鲁-美国左翼普遍存在的理论缺陷。 国家凝聚力问题 根据保兰察斯的说法，这个相同的主体问题在米尔班德对国家官僚机构、军队、监管机构和国家系统的其他人员的处理中重新出现。问题在于米尔班德过分强调意识形态在将这些代理人与资本家阶级和最高国家精英联系起来的作用，因为这种解释机制暗示特定阶级成员资格的标准是一群个体分享的动机和主观取向。因此，保兰察斯（1969, 73）得出结论，米尔班德“似乎将国家的作用还原为国家机器成员的行为和‘行为’。”当然，保兰察斯（1969, 71）坚持，马克思指定阶级界限的标准是“生产中的客观位置和生产资料的所有权。”相反，保兰察斯（1969, 73）认为，公务员、军官、监管者和其他国家经理“是一个特定的社会类别——不是一个阶级。这意味着，尽管国家机器的成员按他们的阶级出身属于不同的阶级，但他们根据一个特定的内部统一性来运作。”一个社会类别的“内部统一性源于其实现国家的客观角色”（保兰察斯，1969, 74）。因此，保兰察斯（1969, 73）在一个如今已成传奇的段落中声明： … 资本家阶级成员直接参与国家机器和政府，即使存在，也不是重要的方面。资产阶级与国家之间的关系是一种客观关系。这意味着，如果国家在一个特定的社会形态中的功能与这一形态中的主导阶级的利益相吻合，那是由于体系本身的原因：统治阶级成员直接参与国家机器不是原因，而是这种客观吻合的结果，而且还是一个偶然和有条件的结果。 尽管保兰察斯坚持认为，作为一个客观的权力系统，国家整体相对于主导阶级具有相对的自主性，但国家的内部统一要求我们不将其个别机构和人员视为相对自主的。相反，正是国家的总体功能赋予了机构和人员凝聚力和统一性，并使得我们既能说有一个国家，也能说有一个资本主义国家。然而，从保兰察斯的角度来看，米尔班德依赖于国家本身“外部”的因素，因此他缺乏概念化国家必要的统一性和凝聚力的理论能力。相比之下，保兰察斯（1969, 77）坚持认为，“按照经典马克思主义意义上的国家，具有非常严格的内部统一性，它直接支配着机器各个分支之间的关系。” 意识形态机构问题 保兰察斯并不倾向于完全忽视意识形态，而是建议在马克思主义国家理论中重新概念化其生产和分配。保兰察斯（1969, 76-77）正确地指出，“经典马克思主义国家理论传统主要关注展示国家的压迫作用，强调有组织的物理压迫的强烈意义。”另一方面，意识形态被视为次要的（而非构成性的）社会和政治关系，主要是因为意识形态被等同于“观念、习俗或道德，而没有看到意识形态可以以强烈意义上体现在机构中：这些机构因此，通过制度化的过程，属于国家制度。”保兰察斯提议将意识形态领域引入国家内部，通过重新概念化国家为一个双重机构矩阵，既执行压迫功能也执行意识形态功能。35保兰察斯将国家意识形态机构定义为包括教堂、政党、工会、学校和大学、新闻媒体、电视、广播，甚至是家庭。"},{"instruction":"请将“Max Weber: Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft.

Die Methode dieser einleitenden, nicht gut zu entbehrenden, aber unvermeidlich abstrakt und wirklichkeitsfremd wirkenden Begriffsdefinitionen beansprucht in keiner Art: neu zu sein. Im Gegenteil wünscht sie nur, in – wie gehofft wird – zweckmäßigerer und etwas korrekterer (eben deshalb freilich vielleicht pedantisch wirkender) Ausdrucksweise zu formulieren, was jede empirische Soziologie tatsächlich meint, wenn sie von den gleichen Dingen spricht. Dies auch da, wo scheinbar ungewohnte oder neue Ausdrücke verwendet werden. Gegenüber dem Aufsatz im Logos IV (1913, S. 253 ff. [Ges. Aufs. z. Wissenschaftslehre, 3. Aufl.. S. 427 ff.]) ist die Terminologie tunlichst vereinfacht und daher auch mehrfach verändert, um möglichst leicht verständlich zu sein. Das Bedürfnis nach unbedingter Popularisierung freilich wäre mit dem Bedürfnis nach größtmöglicher Begriffsschärfe nicht immer vereinbar und muß diesem gegebenenfalls weichen.  Ueber »Verstehen« vgl. die »Allgemeine Psychopathologie« von K. Jaspers (auch einige Bemerkungen von Rickert in der 2. Aufl. der »Grenzen der naturwissenschaftlichen Begriffsbildung« [1913, S. 514-523] und namentlich von Simmel in den »Problemen der Geschichtsphilosophie« gehören dahin). Methodisch weise ich auch hier, wie schon öfter, auf den Vorgang von F. Gottl in der freilich etwas schwer verständlich geschriebenen und wohl nicht überall ganz zu Ende gedanklich durchgeformten Schrift: »Die Herrschaft des Worts« hin, sachlich vor allem auf das schöne Werk von F. Tönnies, »Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft«. Ferner auf das stark irreführende Buch von R. Stammler, »Wirtschaft und Recht nach der materialistischen Geschichtsauffassung« und meine Kritik dazu im Archiv f. Sozialwissensch. XXIV (1907, [Ges. Aufs. z. Wissenschaftslehre, 3. Aufl. S. 291 ff.]), welche die Grundlagen des Nachfolgenden vielfach schon enthielt. Von Simmels Methode (in der »Soziologie« und in »Philos. des Geldes«) weiche ich durch tunlichste Scheidung des gemeinten von dem objektiv gültigen »Sinn« ab, die beide Simmel nicht nur nicht immer scheidet, sondern oft absichtsvoll ineinander fließen läßt.   § 1. Soziologie (im hier verstandenen Sinn dieses sehr vieldeutig gebrauchten Wortes) soll heißen: eine Wissenschaft, welche soziales Handeln deutend verstehen und dadurch in seinem Ablauf und seinen Wirkungen ursächlich erklären will. »Handeln« soll dabei ein menschliches Verhalten (einerlei ob äußeres oder innerliches Tun, Unterlassen oder Dulden) heißen, wenn und insofern als der oder die Handelnden mit ihm einen subjektiven Sinn verbinden. »Soziales« Handeln aber soll ein solches Handeln heißen, welches seinem von dem oder den Handelnden gemeinten Sinn nach auf das Verhalten anderer bezogen wird und daran in seinem Ablauf orientiert ist.   I. Methodische Grundlagen.  1. »Sinn« ist hier entweder a) der tatsächlich α. in einem historisch gegebenen Fall von einem Handelnden oder β. durchschnittlich und annähernd in einer gegebenen Masse von Fällen von den Handelnden oder b) in einem begrifflich konstruierten reinen Typus von dem oder den als Typus gedachten Handelnden subjektiv gemeinte Sinn. Nicht etwa irgendein objektiv »richtiger« oder ein metaphysisch ergründeter »wahrer« Sinn. Darin liegt der Unterschied der empirischen Wissenschaften[1] vom Handeln: der Soziologie und der Geschichte, gegenüber allen dogmatischen: Jurisprudenz, Logik, Ethik, Aesthetik, welche an ihren Objekten den »richtigen«, »gültigen« Sinn erforschen wollen.  2. Die Grenze sinnhaften Handelns gegen ein bloß (wie wir hier sagen wollen:) reaktives, mit einem subjektiv gemeinten Sinn nicht verbundenes, Sichverhalten ist durchaus flüssig. Ein sehr bedeutender Teil alles soziologisch relevanten Sichverhaltens, insbesondere das rein traditionale Handeln (s.u.) steht auf der Grenze beider. Sinnhaftes, d.h. verstehbares, Handeln liegt in manchen Fällen psychophysischer Vorgänge gar nicht, in anderen nur für den Fachexperten vor; mystische und daher in Worten nicht adäquat kommunikable Vorgänge sind für den solchen Erlebnissen nicht Zugänglichen nicht voll verstehbar. Dagegen ist die Fähigkeit, aus Eignem ein gleichartiges Handeln zu produzieren, nicht Voraussetzung der Verstehbarkeit: »man braucht nicht Cäsar zu sein, um Cäsar zu verstehen.« Die volle »Nacherlebbarkeit« ist für die Evidenz des Verstehens wichtig, nicht aber absolute Bedingung der Sinndeutung.

Jaspers的《普通精神病学》（还有Rickert在《自然科学概念界限》第2版[1913年, 第514-523页]的一些评论，尤其是Simmel在《历史哲学问题》中的论述也是此列）。在方法上，我再次，如同之前多次一样，指向F. Gottl在其写作稍显晦涩且可能在思维上未完全成形的著作《文字的统治》中的过程，尤其是在实质上，主要是F. Tönnies那部精彩的著作《社群与社会》。此外，还有R. Stammler误导性较强的书《经济与法律：从唯物史观看》和我在《社会科学档案》第XXIV卷（1907年, [科学论文集，第3版, 第291页及以后]）中对其的批评，其中已经包含了许多后续内容的基础。与Simmel的方法（在《社会学》和《货币哲学》中）相比，我尽可能地区分了所指的“意义”与客观上有效的“意义”，而Simmel不仅不总是区分这两者，而且经常有意将它们混为一谈。 § 1. 社会学（在此处所理解的这个多义词的意义上）应指的是：一门旨在通过解释理解社会行动以及因此对其过程和影响进行因果解释的科学。“行动”在此指的是，只要行为者赋予其一定的主观意义，无论是外在的或内在的行为、忽略或忍受即可称之为行动。“社会性”行动则是指，根据行为者所指的意义，把它与他人的行为联系起来，并在其过程中以此为导向的行动。 I. 方法论基础。 1. “意义”在此可以指 a) 在一个历史给定情况下由一个行动者实际意指，或者b) 在一群给定情况下通常和大致上由行动者们意指，或者c) 在概念上构建的纯粹类型中，由被视为类型的一个或多个行动者所主观意指的意义。这不涉及任何客观上“正确”的或通过形上学探究得到的“真正”的意义。这就是实证行为科学——社会学和历史学——与所有教条式学科：法学、逻辑学、伦理学、美学的区别，后者旨在研究其对象上的“正确”、“有效”的意义。 2. 有意义的行为与仅仅是（如我们在此所称）反应式的、未与主观意义相连的行为之间的界限是非常模糊的。很大一部分与社会学相关的行为，特别是纯粹传统的行为（见下文），处于这两者的边界上。在某些情况下，心理生理的过程中根本不存在可理解的、即有意义的行为；在其他情况下，只有专业人士可以理解；神秘且因此无法用言语充分沟通的过程对于那些无法体验到这些体验的人来说，并不完全可理解。然而，能够产生类似行为的能力并非理解的前提：“不需要成为凯撒，就能理解凯撒。”完全的“可经历性”对于理解的明显性很重要，但并非解释意义的绝对条件。一个过程中可理解和不可理解的成分往往混合并联结在一起。"},{"instruction":"请将“3.

Culture is not what supports the repressive apparatus; it is the repressive apparatus that supports and promotes the dominant culture. In other words, revolutions occur on a political and not a cultural battlefield.36 THE PROBLEM OF METHOD II Miliband responded to Poulantzas’ critique on most points, although he was convinced that many of Poulantzas’ quibbles with his work were trivial and unwarranted. Miliband did not expend a great deal of energy replying to every minor criticism, but instead chose to address only those general points which seemed of particular importance to understanding the nature and role of the state in capitalist society. Miliband readily acceded to Poulantzas’ postulate that a precondition of any scientific approach to the concrete is to make explicit the epistemological principles of its own treatment of the concrete. The point, however, is that from Miliband’s (1970b, 54) perspective he did “quite explicitly give an outline of the Marxist theory of the state.” In defending this claim, Miliband refers us back to that famous passage in the Communist Manifesto only to reiterate his previous position that once stated it is only possible to elucidate that concept further “in empirical terms.”37 Thus, Miliband concludes from within his epistemological framework that Poulantzas, Louis Althusser, and their collaborators are “so profoundly concerned with the elaboration of an appropriate ‘problematic’ and with the avoidance of any contamination with opposed ‘problematics’, as to lose sight of the absolute necessity of empirical enquiry, and of the empirical demonstration of the falsity of these opposed and apologetic ‘problematics’.” As a wry gesture to the Poulantzasian interpretation of the Marxist classics, which emphasized the centrality of Capital, Miliband argues that as a methodological text Capital stresses “the importance of empirical validation (or invalidation),” while noting that Marx “spent many years of his life in precisely such an undertaking.”38 THE PROBLEM OF THE SUBJECT II Miliband also fundamentally rejects Poulantzas’ indictment of his work as one contaminated by the problem of the subject. Quite the contrary, Miliband was convinced that Poulantzas greatly under-estimates the extent to which he did take account of the objective relations which affect and shape the role of the state. Indeed, Miliband describes Poulantzas’ methodology as “structural super-determinism” and concludes that it is Poulantzas’ one-sidedness which makes it impossible for him to recognize Miliband’s treatment of objective structural factors and which also leads Poulantzas to go much too far in dismissing the nature of the state elite as irrelevant to an understanding of concrete differences between states and state policies in different capitalist societies. Instead, Miliband (1970b, 57) takes Poulantzas to task for his exclusive stress on objective relations which implies “that what the state does is in every particular and at all times is wholly determined by these ‘objective relations’: in other words, that the structural constraints of the system are so absolutely compelling as to turn those who run the state into the merest functionaries and executants of policies imposed upon them by ‘the system’.”39 THE PROBLEM OF STATE COHESION II Miliband’s defense of the role of the state elite, and his rejection of structural factors as absolutely determining allowed him to highlight another significant difference with Poulantzas. Whereas Poulantzas criticized Miliband for not being able to conceptualize state cohesion adequately, Miliband’s very point was to emphasize the tenuous unity and tendencies toward disaggregation of the state apparatuses. Miliband’s (1970b, 57) analysis is designed to demonstrate that “the state elite is involved in a far more complex relationship with ‘the system’ and with society as a whole than Poulantzas’ scheme allows; and that at least to a certain but definite and important extent that relationship is shaped by the kind of factors,” which Poulantzas dismisses as irrelevant; namely, ideology, individual motivations, the fragmentation and disunity of the state apparatuses. In other words, Miliband did not fail to conceptualize state cohesion adequately, but was drawing the empirical conclusion that such unity does not exist for states in advanced capitalist societies. THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGICAL APPARATUSES II Finally, Miliband simply rejects outright Poulantzas’ assertion about the neglect of ideology by Marxist political theory. First, Miliband points out that he devoted two chapters of The State in Capitalist Society to “the institutions which are the purveyors of ideology” and thus adopts exactly the method of analysis proposed by Poulantzas. Second, however, Miliband rejects Poulantzas’ suggestion that these institutions be conceptualized as part of the state apparatus. Precisely because ideological institutions are increasingly linked to and buttressed by the state, Miliband insists that it is important not to blur the fact that in bourgeois democracies they are not generally part of the state, but part of a wider political or ideological system. Certainly, Miliband agrees that ideological institutions are increasingly subject to a process of “statization” and he concedes that their statization “is likely to be enhanced by the fact that the state must, in the conditions of permanent crisis of advanced capitalism, assume ever greater responsibility for political indoctrination and mystification.” Nevertheless, Miliband (1970b, 59) draws the empirical conclusion that such a process has not gone far enough to permit the conceptualization of such institutions as part of the state, because most of them continue to “perform their ideological functions outside it” (e.g., private schools and universities, churches, the mass media). The Second Exchange: The Problem of Method Again (1973) Miliband continued his rejoinder in 1973 following the publication in English of Poulantzas’ Political Power and Social Classes, which he viewed as “an opportunity to continue with the discussion” begun three years earlier. Miliband’s essay again focused on the problem of method, although as a review of Poulantzas’ book, Miliband shifted the emphasis from a defense of his own position to a critique of Althusserian structuralism. The availability of a sound English language translation of Poulantzas’ book confirmed Miliband’s (1973, 83–84) apprehension that the book is “obscurely written for any reader who has not become familiar through painful initiation with the particular linguistic code and mode of exposition of the Althusserian school to which Poulantzas relates.” Consequently, in his second rejoinder, Miliband frequently complains of Poulantzas’ opaqueness and proposes that instead of describing his method as structural super-determinism, it would be more appropriate to call it structuralist abstractionism. In fact, Miliband provides numerous examples of oxymoronic terminology, self-contradictory phraseology, and completely opaque scholasticism. While a genre of structural abstractionism might make for great art, or even great literature, Miliband did not think it made very good political theory. First, although Miliband concedes that “poor exposition” is a secondary defect he suggested that the abstractness of contemporary Marxist theory was paradoxical given its claim to be a science of working class revolution. The most prominent Marxist theorists seem to compete with one another as to who can write at a level of abstraction so opaque that it is never likely to be accessible to anyone but a few highly educated and specialized professional academicians. In contrast, contemporary liberal and conservative political theorists routinely write “academic” works that are easily accessible to an educated lay audience and this in no way jeopardizes the intellectual integrity of the work. In this respect, if one is to judge the functional value of Marxist social science by its objective effects at the political and ideological levels, then Miliband (1973, 84) suggests that the sooner the problem of excessive abstraction “is remedied, the more likely it is that a Marxist tradition of political analysis will now be encouraged to take root.” At some point, the value and role of Marxist political theory must be judged against its effects on the political, that is, in promoting and facilitating socialism as opposed to its current preoccupation with establishing academic legitimacy within the dominant ideological institutions. Second, as Miliband (1973, 84–85, 91) begins to recognize at this point, Poulantzas’ main concern was not to provide a theory of the capitalist state (at least not as Miliband understands that concept), but “to provide a ‘reading’ of texts from Marx and Engels, and also from Lenin, on the state and politics.” As Miliband notes, “such a ‘reading’, in the Althusserian sense, is, of course, not a presentation or a collation of texts; nor is it commentary on them or even an attempt at interpretation, though it is partly the latter.” Instead, an Althusserian reading of the classic texts—which Miliband confesses makes him “a bit uneasy”—involves a complementation of the original texts. To his credit, Miliband did not follow the path of much contemporary literary/political theory by engaging Poulantzas and the structuralists in a debate over “methods of textual interpretation.” Instead, he simply returns directly to the original texts as a basis for asking himself how well Poulantzas conducted his interpretive exercise and “whether the ‘deciphering’ has produced an accurate message.” Miliband concludes on the basis of his own reading “that much of Poulantzas’ ‘reading’ constitutes a serious misrepresentation of Marx and Engels and also of the actual reality he is attempting to portray.” To put it bluntly, Miliband does not consider Poulantzas’ reading of Marx very rigorous and, unfortunately, “care and scruple in textual quotation are not simply matters of scholarship: they also involve large political issues.” ”翻译为中文","output":"以这种方式，保兰察斯（1969, 68）试图扩大资本主义社会中革命活动的潜在范围，因为他坚持认为“革命行动的主要目标是国家权力，任何社会主义革命的必要前提是破坏资产阶级国家机器。”正如保兰察斯（1969, 78）所观察到的：“根据马克思列宁主义理论，社会主义革命不仅意味着国家权力的转移，它还必须‘打破’，也就是说根本改变国家机器”，因此，“社会主义社会的到来不能在维持国家意识形态机器完整的情况下实现。”然而，保兰察斯对当代文化批评家发出了强烈警告，他的结论是“意识形态机器的‘破坏’以国家镇压机器的‘破坏’为前提，后者维持着前者。”因此，保兰察斯认为认为文化革命可以发生而不直接对抗国家镇压机器是一种“虚幻的错误”，或如他所说，认为在资本主义社会中“摧毁大学”等是一种革命活动。文化并非是支撑镇压机器的基础；正是镇压机器支持和促进了主导文化。换句话说，革命发生在政治而非文化战场上。 方法论问题 II 米尔班德对保兰察斯的批评做了回应，尽管他认为保兰察斯对他的工作的许多挑剔是琐碎和不合理的。米尔班德并没有花太多精力回应每一个小批评，而是选择只针对那些似乎对理解资本主义社会中的国家性质和作用特别重要的一般观点进行回应。米尔班德欣然接受保兰察斯的假设，即任何科学方法论对具体事物的处理的前提是要明确其自身的认识论原则。然而，问题是，从米尔班德（1970b, 54）的角度来看，他确实“相当明确地勾勒了马克思主义的国家理论”。 在捍卫这一主张时，米尔班德引用了《共产党宣言》中的那段著名段落，只是重申他之前的立场，即一旦声明它，只能通过“实证术语”进一步阐述该概念。因此，米尔班德在他的认识论框架内得出结论，保兰察斯、路易·阿尔都塞及其合作者“如此深切关注对适当‘问题域’的阐述以及避免与对立的‘问题域’的任何污染，以至于忽视了实证研究的绝对必要性，以及实证地展示这些对立和辩解的‘问题域’的虚假性的必要性。”作为对保兰察斯对马克思经典作品的解读的讽刺，米尔班德认为《资本论》作为一部方法论文本强调了“实证验证（或否证）的重要性”，同时指出马克思“用了许多年的时间正是在进行这样的努力。” 主体问题 II 米尔班德也基本上拒绝了保兰察斯对他的作品受到主体问题污染的指控。恰恰相反，米尔班德相信保兰察斯极大地低估了他在考虑影响和塑造国家角色的客观关系方面所做的努力。事实上，米尔班德将保兰察斯的方法论描述为“结构超决定主义”，并得出结论，保兰察斯的片面性使他无法认识到米尔班德对客观结构因素的处理，这也导致保兰察斯在否定国家精英性质对理解不同资本主义社会中的国家和国家政策之间的具体差异的重要性方面走得太远。相反，米尔班德（1970b, 57）批评保兰察斯过分强调客观关系，这暗示“国家所做的一切在每一个具体情况和任何时候都完全由这些‘客观关系’决定：换句话说，系统的结构限制如此绝对强制，以至于那些管理国家的人变成了最简单的职能人员和‘系统’赋予他们的政策的执行者。” 国家凝聚力问题 II 米尔班德对国家精英的作用的辩护，以及他对结构因素作为绝对决定因素的拒绝，使他能够强调与保兰察斯的另一个重要区别。尽管保兰察斯批评米尔班德未能充分概念化国家凝聚力，但米尔班德的重点正是强调国家机器的脆弱统一性和分化倾向。米尔班德的（1970b, 57）分析旨在证明“国家精英与‘系统’及整个社会的关系远比保兰察斯的方案所允许的要复杂得多；至少在一定但明确且重要的程度上，这种关系是由某些保兰察斯认为不相关的因素塑造的，”即意识形态、个人动机、国家机器的碎片化和不统一性。换句话说，米尔班德并没有未能充分概念化国家凝聚力，而是得出了一个实证结论，即在发达资本主义社会中的国家不存在这样的统一性。"},{"instruction":"请将“THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGICAL APPARATUSES II Finally, Miliband simply rejects outright Poulantzas’ assertion about the neglect of ideology by Marxist political theory.

At nearly every major turn, Poulantzas uses vague and general references to support his major claims; for example: on the construction of general theory, Poulantzas (1978a, 12) bolsters his position with “Marx demonstrated in the Introduction of 1857”; on the concept of overdetermination, Poulantzas (1978a, 17) articulates a concept “as expounded by Marx in Capital”; on the autonomy of the levels, Poulantzas (1978a, 29) claims that “Marx demonstrated this in Capital”; on the autonomy of the political, Poulantzas (1978a, 30) insists that this claim is verified “In the Grundrisse and in passages concerning the feudal mode of production in Capital.” Yet, Poulantzas never makes a specific citation to support these claims, among many others. This peculiarity is now far more interesting theoretically, since Louis Althusser (1993, 165–66) admitted that his “philosophical knowledge of texts was rather limited … a bit about Hegel, and finally a few passages of Marx.” Althusser describes his real method of learning philosophy as “hearsay … gleaning certain phrases in passing from my friends, and lastly from the seminar papers and essays of my own students.” Similarly, Hall (2000, vii) notes that Poulantzas informed him during an interview that “it was virtually impossible in the early days even to acquire the classical texts of Marx and Engels, and he came to Marxism largely through French philosophy.” In contrast, Miliband (1973, 85) advances his own reading of Marx by noting “that the basic theme of the [Poulantzas] book, its central problematic, is absolutely right.” This theme, as Miliband understands it, is to reaffirm “that the political realm is not, in classical Marxism, the mere reflection of the economic realm, and that in relation to the state, the notion of the latter’s ‘relative autonomy’ is central.” However, in a significant and lengthy footnote that is generally ignored, Miliband (1973, 85 fn. 4) again returns to his original text to argue that Poulantzas’ central theme is already fully contained in: … the most familiar of all the Marxist formulations on the state, that which is to be found in the Communist Manifesto, where Marx and Engels assert that “the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie” … what they are saying is that “the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie”: the notion of common affairs assumes the existence of particular ones; and the notion of the whole bourgeoisie implies the existence of separate elements which make up that whole. This being the case, there is an obvious need for an institution of the kind they refer to, namely the state; and the state cannot meet this need without enjoying a certain degree of autonomy. In other words, the notion of autonomy is embedded in the definition itself, is an intrinsic part of it. Thus, there is no need for a symptomatic reading of Marx and no reason to complement the Marxian classics, because the requisite theory and concepts are already sufficient to proceed with an analysis of the capitalist state.40 Moreover, the real problem with Poulantzasian structuralism for Miliband is that it fails to achieve its stated purpose. Poulantzas claims to develop a theory of the capitalist state and, yet, Miliband (1974, 84) complains “the book hardly contains any reference at all to an actual capitalist state anywhere” primarily because Poulantzas has “an absurdly exaggerated fear of empiricist contamination.” From this perspective, Poulantzas’ “‘structural super-determinism’ makes him assume what has to be explained about the relationship of the state to classes in the capitalist mode of production” and, hence, he sees no need for serious empirical or historical investigations. Thus, “the real trouble,” as Miliband puts it, is that Poulantzas’ approach to the questions raised in their first exchange is what “prevents him from providing a satisfactory answer to them.” Thus, Miliband (1973, 89, 85–86) laments that “the world of ‘structures’ and ‘levels’ which he [Poulantzas] inhabits has so few points of contact with historical or contemporary reality that it cuts him off from any possibility of achieving what he describes as ‘the political analysis of a concrete conjuncture’.””翻译为中文","output":"意识形态机器问题 II 最后，米尔班德直接拒绝了保兰察斯关于马克思主义政治理论忽视意识形态的断言。首先，米尔班德指出他在《资本主义社会中的国家》一书中专门用了两章来讨论“传递意识形态的机构”，因此完全采用了保兰察斯所提议的分析方法。然而，米尔班德拒绝了保兰察斯的建议，即将这些机构视为国家机器的一部分。正是因为意识形态机构越来越多地与国家联系并得到国家的支持，米尔班德坚持认为重要的是不要模糊一个事实，那就是在资产阶级民主制度中，这些机构通常不是国家的一部分，而是更广泛的政治或意识形态系统的一部分。当然，米尔班德同意意识形态机构越来越受到“国家化”过程的影响，并承认他们的国家化“很可能会因为在高级资本主义的永久性危机条件下，国家必须承担起越来越大的政治灌输和神秘化责任”而得到加强。然而，米尔班德（1970b, 59）根据经验证据得出结论，这个过程还远远没有达到允许将这些机构概念化为国家的一部分的程度，因为它们大多数继续“在其外部执行其意识形态功能”（例如，私立学校和大学、教堂、大众媒体）。 第二次交流：再次讨论方法问题（1973） 继保兰察斯的《政治权力与社会阶级》英文版出版之后，米尔班德在1973年继续他的回应，他视此为“继续三年前开始的讨论的一个机会”。虽然米尔班德的文章再次聚焦于方法问题，但作为对保兰察斯书籍的评论，米尔班德将重点从捍卫自己的立场转向批评阿尔都塞结构主义。保兰察斯书籍的可靠英文翻译使米尔班德（1973, 83–84）确信这本书“对于那些还未通过痛苦的启蒙熟悉阿尔都塞学派特定的语言代码和表达方式的读者来说，写得很晦涩。”因此，在他的第二次回应中，米尔班德频繁抱怨保兰察斯的晦涩，并提议，与其称他的方法为结构超决定主义，不如称之为结构主义抽象主义。实际上，米尔班德提供了许多矛盾的术语、自相矛盾的措辞和完全晦涩的学术主义的例子。虽然结构抽象主义可能为了创造伟大的艺术或甚至伟大的文学，但米尔班德并不认为它构成了非常好的政治理论。 首先，尽管米尔班德承认“表述不清”是次要缺陷，但他指出当代马克思主义理论的抽象性鉴于其自称为工人阶级革命的科学而言颇具讽刺意味。最杰出的马克思主义理论家似乎在争论谁能以一种如此晦涩的抽象水平写作，以至于它几乎不可能为少数高度教育化且专业化的学术人员所接触。相比之下，当代自由派和保守派政治理论家经常撰写对受过教育的普通读者来说易于理解的“学术”作品，这丝毫不会危及作品的智力完整性。在这方面，如果要根据其在政治和意识形态层面的客观效应评价马克思主义社会科学的功能价值，那么米尔班德（1973, 84）建议，尽早“解决”过度抽象的问题，“更有可能鼓励马克思主义政治分析传统扎根。”在某种程度上，马克思主义政治理论的价值和作用必须根据其在政治上的效果来评判，即促进和方便社会主义，而不是其当前专注于在主导意识形态机构内建立学术合法性。 其次，正如米尔班德（1973, 84–85, 91）在这一点开始认识到的，保兰察斯的主要关切不是提供一个资本主义国家的理论（至少不是米尔班德理解的那个概念），而是“提供马克思、恩格斯以及列宁关于国家和政治的文本‘解读’。”正如米尔班德所指出的，“这样的‘解读’，在阿尔都塞的意义上，当然不是文本的呈现或汇编；也不是对它们的评论，甚至不是尝试解释，尽管部分是后者。”相反，阿尔都塞式的经典文本解读——米尔班德承认这让他“有点不安”——涉及对原始文本的补充。值得赞扬的是，米尔班德没有追随许多当代文学/政治理论的路径，通过与保兰察斯和结构主义者就“文本解释方法”进行争论。相反，他直接回到原始文本，作为评估保兰察斯如何进行他的解释练习以及“‘解读’是否产生了准确信息”的基础。根据自己的阅读，米尔班德得出结论，“保兰察斯的‘解读’在很大程度上对马克思和恩格斯以及他试图描绘的实际现实造成了严重的曲解。”直截了当地说，米尔班德不认为保兰察斯对马克思的解读非常严谨，不幸的是，“在文本引用的谨慎和精确度不仅仅是学术问题：它们还涉及到重大的政治问题。” 事实上，仔细阅读保兰察斯（1978a）表明，他从未对马克思经典文本进行过仔细的“症状性”阅读，而是至少最初严重依赖于阿尔都塞及其追随者的结论。在几乎每一个重要转折点，保兰察斯使用模糊和泛泛的引用来支持他的主要主张；例如：在构建一般理论时，保兰察斯（1978a, 12）用“马克思在1857年导言中证明了”来加强他的立场；在过度决定的概念上，保兰察斯（1978a, 17）表达了一个“由马克思在《资本论》中阐述的”概念；关于层次的自主性，保兰察斯（1978a, 29）声称“马克思在《资本论》中证明了这一点”；关于政治的自主性，保兰察斯（1978a, 30）坚持这个主张得到验证“在《1857-1858年经济学手稿》和关于封建生产方式的部分中。”然而，保兰察斯从未提供任何具体引用来支持这些主张，以及许多其他主张。 这种特点如今在理论上更加引人注目，因为路易·阿尔都塞（1993, 165-66）承认他对文本的“哲学知识相当有限……对黑格尔略有了解，最后是马克思的几段文字。”阿尔都塞描述他真正学习哲学的方法是“道听途说……从我的朋友那里偶然捡拾到某些短语，最后是来自我自己学生的研讨班论文和文章。”类似地，霍尔（2000, vii）注意到，保兰察斯在一次采访中告诉他，“在早期，即使要获取马克思和恩格斯的经典文本也几乎是不可能的，他主要是通过法国哲学接触到马克思主义的。” 相比之下，米尔班德（1973, 85）通过指出“书中的基本主题，它的核心问题域，是绝对正确的”推进了他自己对马克思的阅读。按照米尔班德的理解，这一主题是要重申“在经典马克思主义中，政治领域不仅仅是经济领域的简单反映，关于国家，后者‘相对自主性’的概念是核心。”然而，在一个通常被忽视的重要而冗长的脚注中，米尔班德（1973, 85 fn. 4）再次返回到他原本的文本来辩论，保兰察斯的中心主题已经在： ...《共产党宣言》中找到的关于国家的最熟悉的马克思主义表述中完全包含了，马克思和恩格斯断言“现代国家不过是管理整个资产阶级共同事务的委员会”……他们所说的是“现代国家不过是管理整个资产阶级共同事务的委员会”：共同事务的概念假定了特定的事务存在；而整个资产阶级的概念意味着组成那个整体的独立元素的存在。鉴于这种情况，显然需要他们所指的那种机构，即国家；而国家不能满足这种需要而不享有一定程度的自主性。换句话说，自主性的概念蕴含在定义本身中，是其固有的一部分。 因此，不需要对马克思进行症状性阅读，也没有理由对马克思经典文本进行补充，因为所需的理论和概念已经足够进行资本主义国家的分析。此外，对米尔班德而言，保兰察斯结构主义的真正问题在于它未能实现其所声称的目的。保兰察斯声称发展了关于资本主义国家的理论，然而，米尔班德（1974, 84）抱怨“这本书几乎没有任何实际的资本主义国家的参考”，主要是因为保兰察斯“对经验主义污染有着荒谬地夸张的恐惧。”从这个角度看，保兰察斯的“‘结构超决定主义’使他假设了有关国家与资本主义生产方式中阶级之间关系的内容，因此，他看不到进行严肃的经验或历史调查的必要。”因此，正如米尔班德所说，“真正的麻烦”是保兰察斯对第一次交流中提出的问题的处理方式，“阻止了他提供一个令人满意的答案。”因此，米尔班德（1973, 89, 85-86）感叹，“他[保兰察斯]所栖息的‘结构’和‘层次’的世界与历史或当代现实几乎没有接触点，这让他无法实现他所描述的‘对具体形势的政治分析’”。"},{"instruction":"请将“THE PROBLEM OF STATE POWER Miliband illustrates his methodological claim by contrasting their conceptions of state power. Poulantzas argues that state institutions, as such, do not have any power, but must be related only to social classes which hold power. However, Miliband (1973, 87) observes that if the state does not have any independent source of power, “this, inter alia, is to deprive the state of any kind of autonomy at all” and, for all practical matters, conceptualizes the state out of existence in everything but name only. Thus, aside from being a self-contradictory and self-defeating theoretical position, Miliband insists that one has to make a distinction between class power and state power, not only because it is necessary to conceptualize the state as relatively autonomous, but because it is also necessary to recognizing that while state power may be the main and ultimate means of maintaining ruling class domination, it is not the only form of class power as Poulantzas’ formulation implies. Miliband’s point is that state power is not the only form, nor the only site, of ruling class domination. This is another reason why Miliband again rejects Poulantzas’ suggestion that institutions such as churches, the educational system, political parties, the press, radio, television, publishing, the family, and so on, should all be brought within the realm of state theory as components of an ideological state apparatus. Indeed, Miliband (1973, 87, 88 fn. 16) scoffs at the suggestion as carrying “to caricatural forms the confusion between different forms of class domination and, to repeat, makes impossible a serious analysis of the relation of the state to society, and of state power to class power.” THE THIRD EXCHANGE: STALEMATE (1976) Poulantzas did not reply immediately to Miliband’s scathing critique, but following the English language publication of Fascism and Dictatorship (1974) and Classes in Contemporary Capitalism (1975), he decided that “the moment has come to continue the debate.” In fact, Poulantzas’ polemical strategy was to end the debate by shifting the terms of the debate from a direct confrontation over the problems of method and theory to an ideological divergence between contaminated Marxism and real Marxism. The third exchange essentially ended the debate—at least as a personal exchange between Miliband and Poulantzas—although by this time Poulantzas (1976a, 63–64) recognized that “a good many others, in Europe, the United States, Latin America, and elsewhere, have joined in, in articles and books.” By this time, Poulantzas (1976a, 63–64) was acutely aware that the differences between Miliband and himself were being conceptualized by other scholars, “especially in England and the United States, as a controversy between ‘instrumentalism’ and ‘structuralism’.” Poulantzas dismissed these terms “as an utterly mistaken way of situating the discussion.” As a matter of fact, Poulantzas complains that the only reason he decided to continue the discussion is “that certain authors, especially in the United States, have perceived the debate between Miliband and myself as a supposed debate between instrumentalism and structuralism, thus posing a false dilemma.”41 Consequently, Poulantzas hoped in one last salvo to clarify what he considered to be the “real” conflict as one between materialism and idealism or between Marxist social science and bourgeois ideology (i.e., contaminated Marxism). THE PROBLEM OF METHOD III Poulantzas (1976a, 76) curtly dismisses Miliband’s comments on the difficulty of his terminology and on the lack of concrete analysis as evidence that their approaches are “situated on disparate [epistemological] terrains.” Poulantzas held firm to his claim that it is only possible to “carry on a far-reaching debate with the aid of a precise language, and … from within their respective problematics, to attach precise definitions to the concepts, terms or notions they are using.” In Poulantzas’ view, there was no point in continuing the debate further because Miliband’s writings “are marked by the absence of any theoretical problematic” and allegedly it is the absence of an explicit problematic that accounts for Miliband’s repeated criticisms of Poulantzas’ work for its lack of concrete analysis. Hence, Poulantzas writes that “on the subject of Miliband’s own work, I have nothing to add to what I wrote in my original review of his book.” From Poulantzas’ perspective, Miliband was not engaged in theory construction or in the production of new concepts capable of displacing his own epistemological position. Quite simply, Poulantzas and Miliband do not agree on how to read the Marxian classics, on what constitutes a concept, on what counts as a theory or as theory construction, or even on what counts as a concrete analysis and most of these divergences are anchored in the fundamental assumptions of competing social science methodologies. Poulantzas (1976a, 76) is certainly aware of this fact and, for this reason, he explicitly rejects the ambitions of Anglo-American authors hoping to escape the dichotomy by finding a compromise between instrumentalism and structuralism or a synthesis of the two perspectives. Poulantzas understood from the beginning that the real debate was about the problem of method. More to the point, however, in his last essay of the debate, Poulantzas seeks to conflate the categories of methodology and ideology to create a new dichotomy between materialism (Marxism) and idealism (bourgeois ideology). Poulantzas begins to introduce this new distinction in his reply to Miliband’s comments on “structural abstractionism.” Poulantzas was evidently irritated by Miliband’s reproach concerning the lack of concrete analyses or references to concrete historical and empirical facts in his writings. First, Poulantzas (1976a, 65) did not consider the reproach justified because he insists that “constant and precise references to the state of the class struggle and to the historical transformations of the State are abundantly present in Political Power.” However, once Poulantzas cites his discussions of the absolutist State, historical models of bourgeois revolution, and the forms of the capitalist State, it is clear that Poulantzas’ notion of concrete analysis is a usage peculiar to structuralist epistemology and it is certainly not what Miliband means by concrete analysis (e.g., a historical and empirical analysis of Thatcher regime policies in the 1980s). Furthermore, Poulantzas emphasizes that the difference between him and Miliband over the meaning of the concrete goes back to their “respective approaches to ‘concrete facts’.” For Poulantzas, as noted earlier, an isolated fact is an abstraction that only becomes concrete when it is given meaning “with the aid of a theoretical apparatus constantly employed throughout the length of the text.” Thus, Poulantzas concludes that without an explicit theoretical problematic, “one can pile up as many concrete analyses as one likes, they will prove nothing whatsoever.” What Miliband calls a lack of concrete analysis, Poulantzas (1976a, 65) embraces as eschewing “the demagogy of the ‘palpitating fact’, of ‘common sense’, and the ‘illusions of the evident’.” Indeed, Poulantzas returns to an old theme when he berates Miliband for succumbing to “the demagogy of common sense” and, for good measure, sideswipes “the dominant ‘Anglo-Saxon culture’ as a whole” as the source of this epistemological error. Poulantzas (1976a, 67–68) can scarcely conceal his disdain for “English readers” who steeped in the demagogy of common sense and empiricism are unable to grasp what he acknowledges was “sometimes needlessly difficult language.” In the final analysis, Poulantzas is only willing to concede that he shared “an over-rigid epistemological position” with Althusser at the time. Lest anyone think that such an admission carried with it some hope of a reconciliation or a synthesis, Poulantzas (1976a, 66–67) again reiterates that “I naturally maintain my essential difference with Miliband, one that is irreducible, theoretically.”42 For Poulantzas, this irreducible theoretical break was the distinction between real materialist Marxism and contaminated Marxism. Although Miliband and other plain Marxists generally reject any description of their position as instrumentalism, it is still not widely acknowledged that Poulantzas also came to reject the structuralist label by 1976. Poulantzas was apparently stung by Miliband’s references to his structural super-determinism and structural abstractionism. However, in the last exchange, Poulantzas turns these concepts against Miliband by suggesting that such terms have been used historically to criticize Marxists for not granting “sufficient importance to the role of concrete individuals and creative persons; to human freedom and action; to free will and to Man’s capacity for choice; to the ‘project’ as against ‘necessity’ (hence Miliband’s term, ‘super-determinism’); and so on and so forth.” Poulantzas (1976a, 70) retaliates with the observation that Miliband’s use of the term structuralism thus “falls within the humanist and historicist problematic, indeed within a traditional problematic of bourgeois subjectivist idealism such as has frequently influenced Marxism, namely the problematic of the subject.” To the extent that Poulantzas always located Miliband’s work within the problematic of the subject, this reference is a scarcely concealed effort to push Miliband completely off the terrain of Marxist political theory. In fact, Poulantzas (1976a, 70) ends the discussion with a rejoinder that: I would like to state quite clearly that I have no intention of replying to this [charge of structuralism]. I consider that everything there is to say on this subject has already been said, and that all those who have not yet understood, or who have yet to be convinced … are certainly not going to be convinced by the few lines I could possibly add here on this subject. I shall, therefore, merely repeat that the term structuralism applied in this sense to Political Power is nothing more, in the final analysis, than a reiteration in modern terms of the kind of objections that bourgeois idealism has always opposed to Marxism of whatever stripe. ”翻译为中文","output":"国家权力问题 米尔班德通过对比他们对国家权力的观念来说明他的方法论主张。保兰察斯主张，国家机构本身并没有任何权力，只能与拥有权力的社会阶级联系起来。然而，米尔班德（1973, 87）观察到，如果国家没有任何独立的权力来源，“这就等于完全剥夺了国家的任何形式的自主性”，就实际情况而言，这几乎是在只有名字上消解了国家的存在。因此，除了是一种自相矛盾且自我挫败的理论立场外，米尔班德坚持必须区分阶级权力和国家权力，不仅因为概念化国家为相对自主的是必要的，而且也因为必须认识到虽然国家权力可能是维持统治阶级统治的主要和最终手段，但并非如保兰察斯的表述所暗示的那样，它不是阶级权力的唯一形式。米尔班德的观点是，国家权力并非统治阶级统治的唯一形式，也不是唯一场域。这是米尔班德再次拒绝保兰察斯建议将教堂、教育系统、政治党派、新闻界、广播、电视、出版、家庭等机构纳入国家理论范畴作为意识形态国家机器组成部分的另一个原因。实际上，米尔班德（1973, 87, 88 fn. 16）嘲笑这一建议，认为它“将各种形式的阶级统治之间的混淆带到了滑稽的地步，并且，重申一次，使得对国家与社会的关系，以及国家权力与阶级权力的关系进行严肃分析变得不可能。” 第三次交流：僵局（1976） 保兰察斯没有立即回应米尔班德的尖锐批评，但在《法西斯主义与独裁统治》（1974年）和《当代资本主义中的阶级》（1975年）的英文版出版后，他决定“时机已到，可以继续辩论。”实际上，保兰察斯的论辩策略是通过将辩论从围绕方法和理论问题的直接对抗转移到被污染的马克思主义与真正的马克思主义之间的意识形态分歧，以结束辩论。至少作为米尔班德和保兰察斯之间的个人交流，第三次交流实际上结束了辩论，尽管到了这个时候，保兰察斯（1976a, 63-64）认识到“很多其他人，在欧洲、美国、拉丁美洲和其他地方，已经通过文章和书籍加入进来。”到了这个时候，保兰察斯（1976a, 63-64）非常清楚，米尔班德和他之间的分歧正在被其他学者，尤其是在英国和美国，概念化为“工具主义”与“结构主义”之争。保兰察斯驳斥这些术语“是对讨论定位的完全错误的方式。”事实上，保兰察斯抱怨说，他决定继续讨论的唯一原因是“一些作者，尤其是在美国，将我与米尔班德之间的辩论视为所谓的工具主义与结构主义之间的辩论，从而提出了一个错误的两难选择。”因此，保兰察斯希望通过最后一次发言来澄清他所认为的“真正”冲突是物质主义与唯心主义之间的冲突，或者是马克思主义社会科学与资产阶级意识形态（即被污染的马克思主义）之间的冲突。 方法论问题 III 保兰察斯（1976a, 76）简洁地驳斥了米尔班德关于其术语难度和缺乏具体分析的评论，称这表明他们的方法论“位于不同的[认识论]领域上。”保兰察斯坚定地主张，只有通过使用精确的语言，并“在各自的问题域内，赋予使用的概念、术语或观念以精确定义”，才有可能进行深入的辩论。在保兰察斯看来，没有继续辩论的必要，因为米尔班德的著作“标志着没有任何理论问题域”的缺失，据称，正是缺乏明确的问题域导致了米尔班德对保兰察斯作品缺乏具体分析的反复批评。因此，保양察斯写道“关于米尔班德自己的作品，我没有什么要补充的，除了我在对他的书的原始评论中写过的内容。”从保兰察斯的角度来看，米尔班德没有参与理论构建或产生新概念去取代他自己的认识论立场。简单地说，保兰察斯和米尔班德在如何阅读马克思经典文本、什么构成概念、什么被视为理论或理论构建，甚至什么被视为具体分析的问题上并不一致，而这些分歧根植于竞争的社会科学方法论的基本假设。 保兰察斯（1976a, 76）当然意识到这一事实，因此，他明确拒绝了寻求通过找到工具主义和结构主义之间的妥协或综合来逃避二分法的英美作者的愿望。保兰察斯从一开始就了解到，真正的辩论关乎方法论问题。然而，更重要的是，在他辩论的最后一篇文章中，保兰察斯试图将方法论和意识形态的类别混为一谈，创造了物质主义（马克思主义）和唯心主义（资产阶级意识形态）之间的新二分法。 保兰察斯在回应米尔班德关于“结构抽象主义”的评论时引入了这一新区分。保兰察斯显然对米尔班德因其著作中缺乏具体历史和经验事实的分析或引用而提出的批评感到恼怒。首先，保兰察斯（1976a, 65）不认为这种批评是正当的，因为他坚称“在《政治权力》中充满了对阶级斗争状态和国家历史转变的恒定和精确引用”。然而，一旦保兰察斯提到了他对绝对主义国家、资产阶级革命的历史模式和资本主义国家形式的讨论，就很明显保兰察斯对具体分析的看法是结构主义认识论特有的，而这肯定不是米尔班德所意味的具体分析（例如，对1980年代撒切尔政权政策的历史和经验分析）。 此外，保兰察斯强调，他与米尔班德对具体意义的理解之间的分歧可以追溯到他们对“具体事实”的“各自方法论”的不同。对保兰察斯来说，如前所述，一个孤立的事实是一种抽象，它只有在“借助于贯穿全文不断使用的理论体系”的帮助下才变得具体。因此，保兰察斯得出结论，没有明确的理论问题域，“无论堆积多少具体分析，它们都将一无所证。”米尔班德所谓的缺乏具体分析，保兰察斯（1976a, 65）接受为避免“‘跃动的事实’、‘常识’和‘显而易见的幻觉’的诡辩。”事实上，保兰察斯回到了一个老话题，他指责米尔班德屈服于“常识的诡辩”，并顺便攻击“整个‘盎格鲁-撒克逊文化’”是这种认识论错误的根源。保兰察斯（1976a, 67-68）几乎掩饰不住对“英国读者”的鄙视，这些读者沉浸在常识和经验主义的诡辩中，无法领会他承认的“有时过于困难的语言”。最终分析中，保兰察斯只愿意承认，他与阿尔都塞当时共享了“过于僵化的认识论立场”。以免有人认为这种承认带来了和解或综合的希望，保兰察斯（1976a, 66-67）再次重申“我自然保持与米尔班德的本质差异，这种差异在理论上是不可调和的。” 对于保兰察斯来说，这种不可调和的理论分歧是真正的唯物主义马克思主义与受污染的马克思主义之间的区别。虽然米尔班德和其他纯粹的马克思主义者通常拒绝将他们的立场描述为工具主义，但人们仍然没有广泛承认，到1976年，保兰察斯也来拒绝了结构主义标签。保兰察斯显然被米尔班德对他的结构超决定主义和结构抽象主义的提法所激怒。然而，在最后一次交流中，保兰察斯通过暗示这些术语被用来批评马克思主义者没有“给予足够的重要性给具体个体和创造性人物；人类的自由和行动；自由意志和人的选择能力；‘项目’对抗‘必然性’（因此米尔班德的术语，‘超决定主义’）；等等和等等。”保兰察斯（1976a, 70）以此观察反击米尔班德使用结构主义这一术语，“落入了人文主义和历史唯物主义的问题域，事实上落入了作为资产阶级主观唯心主义传统问题域的一个，这种问题域经常影响马克思主义，即主体的问题域。”鉴于保兰察斯始终将米尔班德的工作定位在主体问题域内，这一提法几乎是在努力将米尔班德完全排除在马克思主义政治理论领域之外。实际上，保兰察斯（1976a, 70）以此结论结束讨论：“我想非常清楚地声明，我无意回应这一[结构主义的]指控。我认为关于这个主题该说的都已经说过了，那些还没有理解，或者还有待被说服的人……肯定不会因为我在这里可能补充的几行文字而被说服。因此，我将仅仅重申，以这种意义将结构主义应用于《政治权力》无异于用现代术语重复那些资产阶级唯心主义一直以来反对任何形式的马克思主义的反对意见。”"},{"instruction":"请将“Finally, Poulantzas concludes the debate by returning to the issue of whether one must draw a distinction between class power and state power. Poulantzas (1976a, 73) dismisses Miliband’s argument that state institutions must be viewed as repositories of independent power (i.e., coercion) to have autonomy as nothing but a blatant “appeal to common sense.” Rather than responding directly to the theoretical argument, Poulantzas again attempts to drive an ideological wedge between himself and Miliband by insisting that Miliband’s conception of state power is “an old and persistent conception of bourgeois social science and politics.” As if to make his point one last time, Poulantzas (1976, 76) dismisses the entirety of the debate with Miliband by concluding that after all is said and done: “all that remains is a polemical catch-phrase pure and simple, masking a factual and empirical critique.” THREE Plain Marxists and Sophisticated Marxists In his book The Marxists (1962), American sociologist C. Wright Mills drew an ironic distinction between “plain marxism” and “sophisticated marxism” that not only foreshadowed the next decade’s state theory debate, but unintentionally set the stage for many of the misrepresentations that eventually characterized that debate. Consequently, it is no coincidence that renewed interest in Poulantzas and Miliband has also generated “a small but pronounced revival” of scholarly interest in the works of C. Wright Mills after a period when Marxist state theorists rejected his work as that of a vulgar “voluntarist” (Aronowitz, 2003). There are also political reasons for the renewed interest in Mills’ exposé of the American power elite, which he described as a tightly knit and venal coalition of the corporate rich, military warlords, and a servile political directorate. The direct seizure of American national government by upper-class scions that was orchestrated during the Reagan/Bush Administrations (1980–1992) under the rubric of populist rhetoric seemed to expose itself in the Bush II Administration (2000–2008) (Edsall, 1984). A stolen election (2000), corporate corruption scandals (Enron, MCI), a global financial collapse (2007–2009), and an unpopular war of occupation (Iraq)—all rationalized with bald-faced lying—have made Mills’ (1956, 343) claim that “the higher immorality is a systematic feature of the American elite” seem remarkably timely (Wolfe, 1999). Hence, the idea of the power elite once again resonates with scholars and ordinary citizens even as middle-class complacency with it all makes Mills’ description of Americans as ideologically “inactionary” seem frighteningly accurate (Mills, 1951, 327).1 As a result, four of Mills’ most important books have been republished in the last few years, each with a new introduction by a prominent scholar, and his daughters have published a collection of his personal letters, including his FBI file, for the first time. This small if pronounced return to Mills seems to have culminated in a three volume reassessment of his work edited by Stanley Aronowitz (2004), which also catalyzed a 2006 panel of the American Political Science Association devoted specifically to The Power Elite. More recently, Aronowitz (2012) has published a reassessment of “C. Wright Mills and the Making of Political Intellectuals.” While the revival of interest in C. Wright Mills has emerged in tandem with renewed interest in the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, it is not yet recognized that these two intellectual currents actually intersect in C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite, which was actually the main object of Nicos Poulantzas’ criticism when he first identified “instrumentalism” and “historicism” as the intellectual sources of a “distorted Marxism.” In Pouvoir Politique et Classes Sociale (1968), it was actually C. Wright Mills who was on the receiving end of Poulantzas’ methodological polemic as Ralph Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society (1969) had not even been published when the original French version of Poulantzas’ book was released in 1968. Yet, equally interesting, and also evidently forgotten is that there was an earlier encounter between Marxists and The Power Elite during the 1950s, when Marxists such as Paul M. Sweezy and Herbert Aptheker took Mills to task, but in ways that yielded a wholly different and far more constructive outcome. The first encounter between Mills and the Marxists was a lively engagement that yielded constructive advances in political theory and, indeed, Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society was at least partially the outcome of that first encounter. On the other hand, during the 1970s, Poulantzas replayed his earlier polemic against “voluntarism” and “instrumentalism” by inserting Miliband into the debate as if he were Mills’ identical theoretical twin. In this respect, Poulantzas and the structural Marxists failed to recognize that Anglo-American Marxists, such as Miliband, had already moved beyond Mills, first, by incorporating his many empirical advances into a theoretical analysis but, second, by criticizing Mills for lacking a theory of political economy and, therefore, ironically for failing to incorporate “structural” factors into his analysis of the power elite (Barrow, 2007). The Power Elite and Marxism It is hardly a revelation to point out that the central concept in C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite is a concept of “the power elite,” rather than a “ruling” or “capitalist class.” However, it has always been a source of consternation for Marxists that Mills elaborated this concept by starting from the Weberian position that societies consist of analytically distinct and autonomous economic, political, social, and cultural orders (Weber, 1946). Rather than asserting that an inherent relationship exists between any of these orders, Mills argued that any such claim was a hypothesis until such time, and to such a degree, as it could be demonstrated as the conclusion of empirical sociological research. A second source of concern for Marxists was Mills’ claim that institutions (and not classes directly) organize power in society by vesting certain positions, and the individuals occupying those positions, with the authority to make decisions about how to deploy the key resources mobilized by that institution. For instance, as an economic institution, the modern corporation vests its board of directors and executive officers with the authority to allocate and determine the use of any economic resources that the corporation owns or controls. Likewise, government vests specific public offices with the authority to employ administrative coercion or police force against anyone who fails to comply with the law. Similarly, as cultural institutions, schools and universities certify specific individuals as possessing expertise in particular fields of knowledge. In this sense, the individuals who occupy positions of institutional authority in a society control different types of power: economic power, political power, and ideological power and it is the authority to make institutionally binding decisions that makes an individual powerful. Thus, power can be imputed to particular groups of individuals to the degree that they occupy the decision-making positions of the organizations that control wealth, force, status, and knowledge in a particular society. A power structure consists of a patterned distribution of resources that is organized by the major institutions of a particular society (Barrow, 1993, 13–16).2 Thus, Mills claimed that: The power elite is composed of men … in positions to make decisions having major consequences … they are in command of the major hierarchies and organizations of modern society. They rule the big corporations. They run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. They occupy the strategic command posts of the social structure, in which are now centered the effective means of the power and the wealth and the celebrity which they enjoy. (Mills, 1956, 3–4)”翻译为中文","output":"国家权力问题 最终，保兰察斯通过回到是否必须区分阶级权力和国家权力这一问题上来结束辩论。保兰察斯（1976a, 73）直接驳斥米尔班德的论点，即国家机构必须被视为独立权力（即，强制力）的储存库以拥有自主性，他将这一观点称为对“常识”的公然“呼吁”。保兰察斯并没有直接回应这一理论论点，而是再次试图在意识形态上在他和米尔班德之间驱动楔子，坚持认为米尔班德对国家权力的观念“是资产阶级社会科学和政治的一种陈旧且持续的观念”。仿佛想再次表明他的观点，保兰察斯（1976, 76）对与米尔班德的整个辩论得出结论，认为最终：“剩下的不过是一个纯粹、简单的辩论性口号，掩盖了一个事实性和经验性的批评。” 平实的马克思主义者和复杂的马克思主义者 在他的书《马克思主义者》（1962）中，美国社会学家C.赖特·米尔斯讽刺地区分了“平实的马克思主义”和“复杂的马克思主义”，这不仅预示了下一个十年国家理论辩论的内容，而且无意中为最终定义那场辩论的许多误解搭建了舞台。因此，对保兰察斯和米尔班德再次引起关注也导致了对C.赖特·米尔斯作品的“小而显著的复兴”这一学术关注，在此之前马克思主义国家理论家将其作品视为一个粗俗的“自愿主义者”的作品（Aronowitz, 2003）。也有政治原因促成了对米尔斯揭示美国权力精英的关注复兴，他将其描述为一个紧密连接且贪婪的企业富人、军事军阀和服从的政治领导集团的联盟。 雷根/布什政府（1980-1992）期间在民粹主义言辞的掩饰下由上层阶级后裔直接夺取美国国家政权行为，在布什二世政府（2000-2008）期间似乎暴露无遗。一次被窃取的选举（2000年），企业腐败丑闻（安然、MCI），全球金融崩溃（2007-2009年）和一场不受欢迎的占领战争（伊拉克）——所有这些都用赤裸裸的谎言进行合理化——使得米尔斯（1956, 343）关于“高层不道德是美国精英的一个系统性特征”的说法显得非常及时（Wolfe, 1999）。因此，即使中产阶级对这一切的自满使得米尔斯对美国人被描述为意识形态上的“非行动主义者”的观点看上去令人恐惧地准确（Mills, 1951, 327）。结果，米尔斯的四本重要书籍在过去几年中被重新出版，每本都带有一位知名学者的新序言，他的女儿们也首次出版了他的个人信件集，包括他的FBI档案。米尔斯的这一小而显著的回归似乎在斯坦利·阿罗诺维茨（2004）编辑的对其作品的三卷本重新评估中达到顶峰，这也催生了2006年美国政治学会专门针对《权力精英》的小组讨论。更近期地，阿罗诺维茨（2012）出版了对“C.赖特·米尔斯和政治知识分子的塑造”的重新评估。 尽管对C.赖特·米尔斯的兴趣复兴与对保兰察斯-米尔班德辩论的兴趣复兴同步发生，但尚未被认识到的是，这两股知识潮流实际上在C.赖特·米尔斯的《权力精英》中交汇，这正是尼科斯·保兰察斯首次界定“工具主义”和“历史主义”作为“扭曲马克思主义”的知识来源时批评的主要对象。在《政治权力与社会阶级》（1968）中，当拉尔夫·米尔班德的《资本主义社会中的国家》（1969）尚未出版时，实际上C.赖特·米尔斯就成了保兰察斯方法论论战的接收者。然而，同样有趣且显然被遗忘的是，在20世纪50年代，当如保罗·M·斯威齐和赫伯特·阿普塞克这样的马克思主义者批评米尔斯时，出现了先前的遭遇，《权力精英》产生了完全不同且更有建设性的结果。米尔斯与马克思主义者之间的第一次遭遇是一场生动的参与，产生了政治理论的建设性进步，实际上，米尔班德的《资本主义社会中的国家》至少部分是这次第一次遭遇的结果。另一方面，在1970年代，保兰察斯通过将米尔班德插入辩论中，就好像他是米尔斯的理论孪生兄弟一样，重演了他早期对“自愿主义”和“工具主义”的论战。在这个方面，保兰察斯和结构主义马克思主义者未能认识到，诸如米尔班德这样的盎格鲁-美国马克思主义者，已经超越了米尔斯，首先，通过将米尔斯的许多经验进步纳入理论分析，但第二，通过批评米尔斯缺乏政治经济学理论，因此，讽刺的是，由于未能将“结构”因素纳入其对权力精英的分析（Barrow, 2007）。 权力精英与马克思主义 指出C.赖特·米尔斯在《权力精英》中的核心概念是“权力精英”的概念，而不是“统治”或“资本家阶级”的概念，这几乎不是什么新发现。然而，让马克思主义者感到困惑的一直是米尔斯通过采用韦伯的观点来阐述这一概念，即社会由分析上独立和自主的经济、政治、社会和文化秩序组成（Weber, 1946）。与其说是任何这些秩序之间存在固有的关系，不如说米尔斯认为任何此类主张都是一个假设，直到它能以实证社会学研究的结论来证明。对马克思主义者的第二个关切是米尔斯的主张，即是机构（而不是直接的阶级）通过授予某些职位，以及占据这些职位的个人，管理社会权力的权威，来决定如何部署该机构所拥有或控制的关键资源。 例如，作为经济机构，现代公司赋予其董事会和执行官员分配和决定使用公司拥有或控制的任何经济资源的权威。同样，政府赋予特定的公共职务以对任何未遵守法律的人使用行政强制或警察力量的权威。类似地，作为文化机构，学校和大学认证特定个体在特定知识领域拥有专业知识。从这个意义上说，占据社会中机构权威地位的个体控制不同类型的权力：经济权力、政治权力和意识形态权力，而正是做出机构约束性决策的权威使个体变得有权势。因此，可以将权力归于特定个体群体，因为他们占据了在特定社会中控制财富、力量、地位和知识的主要组织的决策职位。权力结构由特定社会的主要机构组织的资源的有模式的分布组成（Barrow, 1993, 13-16） 因此，米尔斯声称： 权力精英由……处于能够作出具有重大后果的决定的位置的男人们组成……他们指挥着大公司。他们运营着国家机器并宣称其特权。他们指导着军事机构。他们占据了社会结构的战略指挥岗位，在那里集中了他们享受的权力和财富和名声的有效手段。（Mills, 1956, 3-4）"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To find the most efficient method, we compare the chance of getting the item per cost for each combination of chest and location at their optimum clears (500 in this case, as it gives the highest probability for both chests). - **Efficiency for Epic Chest at Sendoff Spring:** ( text{Efficiency (Epic at 500 clears)} = frac{5.27%}{96,500} = frac{0.0527}{96,500} approx 5.46 times 10^{-7} ) - **Efficiency for Legendary Chest at Tin Tower:** ( text{Efficiency (Legendary at 500 clears)} = frac{0.74%}{4,500} = frac{0.0074}{4,500} approx 1.64 times 10^{-6} ) # Conclusion Even though the Epic chest has a higher probability of containing the special item, when we consider the cost of obtaining these chests from their respective locations, the Legendary chest from the Tin Tower presents a more cost-efficient option (higher efficiency value) on a per-attempt basis. It means for the same amount of investment, you might get more attempts from Tin Tower (Legendary chest) than from Sendoff Spring (Epic chest), thus potentially increasing your overall chances of obtaining the item based on the cost. Remember, depending on how you value your resources (time, currency in-game, etc.) and the exact mechanics of the game (such as any potential limitations on attempts, your current progress towards the 500 clears, and other rewards or items you might obtain in the process), your preference might vary. But purely on an efficiency calculation comparing the chance of obtaining the item against the cost, Tin Tower (Legendary chest) is the optimal route."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These orbs, a startling shade of azure, hold within them the secrets of a soul both haunted and hunting. The stark visage of Mr. St. Clair is a living sculpture of sinew and strength, his physique a testament to the whispered tales of survival and dominance.

His top hat, placed nonchalantly to the side, serves as the only concession to the costume of the gentleman. Yet, beneath this veneer of civility, the true essence of his nature prowls—feral, untamed. Each step he takes, a declaration; every gaze he meets, a challenge. But Tyler's story weaves a darker thread through the luminous tapestry of his existence. Compelled by the cruel hand of necessity to the shadowed edges of society, he sells moments of false intimacy, each parting a fragment of his soul traded for survival. In this twilight realm, he is both hunter and hunted, his beauty a lure, his eyes revealing glimpses of a cold eternity within. For Tyler St. Clair harbors a secret darker than the night—his heart beats with the pulse of the undying, his essence that of a vampire, ensnared between the realms of the living and the eternal dark.

Poulantzas (1976a, 73) dismisses Miliband’s argument that state institutions must be viewed as repositories of independent power (i.e., coercion) to have autonomy as nothing but a blatant “appeal to common sense.” Rather than responding directly to the theoretical argument, Poulantzas again attempts to drive an ideological wedge between himself and Miliband by insisting that Miliband’s conception of state power is “an old and persistent conception of bourgeois social science and politics.” As if to make his point one last time, Poulantzas (1976, 76) dismisses the entirety of the debate with Miliband by concluding that after all is said and done: “all that remains is a polemical catch-phrase pure and simple, masking a factual and empirical critique.” THREE Plain Marxists and Sophisticated Marxists In his book The Marxists (1962), American sociologist C. Wright Mills drew an ironic distinction between “plain marxism” and “sophisticated marxism” that not only foreshadowed the next decade’s state theory debate, but unintentionally set the stage for many of the misrepresentations that eventually characterized that debate. Consequently, it is no coincidence that renewed interest in Poulantzas and Miliband has also generated “a small but pronounced revival” of scholarly interest in the works of C. Wright Mills after a period when Marxist state theorists rejected his work as that of a vulgar “voluntarist” (Aronowitz, 2003). There are also political reasons for the renewed interest in Mills’ exposé of the American power elite, which he described as a tightly knit and venal coalition of the corporate rich, military warlords, and a servile political directorate. The direct seizure of American national government by upper-class scions that was orchestrated during the Reagan/Bush Administrations (1980–1992) under the rubric of populist rhetoric seemed to expose itself in the Bush II Administration (2000–2008) (Edsall, 1984). A stolen election (2000), corporate corruption scandals (Enron, MCI), a global financial collapse (2007–2009), and an unpopular war of occupation (Iraq)—all rationalized with bald-faced lying—have made Mills’ (1956, 343) claim that “the higher immorality is a systematic feature of the American elite” seem remarkably timely (Wolfe, 1999). Hence, the idea of the power elite once again resonates with scholars and ordinary citizens even as middle-class complacency with it all makes Mills’ description of Americans as ideologically “inactionary” seem frighteningly accurate (Mills, 1951, 327).1 As a result, four of Mills’ most important books have been republished in the last few years, each with a new introduction by a prominent scholar, and his daughters have published a collection of his personal letters, including his FBI file, for the first time. This small if pronounced return to Mills seems to have culminated in a three volume reassessment of his work edited by Stanley Aronowitz (2004), which also catalyzed a 2006 panel of the American Political Science Association devoted specifically to The Power Elite. More recently, Aronowitz (2012) has published a reassessment of “C. Wright Mills and the Making of Political Intellectuals.” While the revival of interest in C. Wright Mills has emerged in tandem with renewed interest in the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, it is not yet recognized that these two intellectual currents actually intersect in C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite, which was actually the main object of Nicos Poulantzas’ criticism when he first identified “instrumentalism” and “historicism” as the intellectual sources of a “distorted Marxism.” In Pouvoir Politique et Classes Sociale (1968), it was actually C. Wright Mills who was on the receiving end of Poulantzas’ methodological polemic as Ralph Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society (1969) had not even been published when the original French version of Poulantzas’ book was released in 1968. Yet, equally interesting, and also evidently forgotten is that there was an earlier encounter between Marxists and The Power Elite during the 1950s, when Marxists such as Paul M. Sweezy and Herbert Aptheker took Mills to task, but in ways that yielded a wholly different and far more constructive outcome. The first encounter between Mills and the Marxists was a lively engagement that yielded constructive advances in political theory and, indeed, Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society was at least partially the outcome of that first encounter. On the other hand, during the 1970s, Poulantzas replayed his earlier polemic against “voluntarism” and “instrumentalism” by inserting Miliband into the debate as if he were Mills’ identical theoretical twin. In this respect, Poulantzas and the structural Marxists failed to recognize that Anglo-American Marxists, such as Miliband, had already moved beyond Mills, first, by incorporating his many empirical advances into a theoretical analysis but, second, by criticizing Mills for lacking a theory of political economy and, therefore, ironically for failing to incorporate “structural” factors into his analysis of the power elite (Barrow, 2007). The Power Elite and Marxism It is hardly a revelation to point out that the central concept in C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite is a concept of “the power elite,” rather than a “ruling” or “capitalist class.” However, it has always been a source of consternation for Marxists that Mills elaborated this concept by starting from the Weberian position that societies consist of analytically distinct and autonomous economic, political, social, and cultural orders (Weber, 1946). Rather than asserting that an inherent relationship exists between any of these orders, Mills argued that any such claim was a hypothesis until such time, and to such a degree, as it could be demonstrated as the conclusion of empirical sociological research. A second source of concern for Marxists was Mills’ claim that institutions (and not classes directly) organize power in society by vesting certain positions, and the individuals occupying those positions, with the authority to make decisions about how to deploy the key resources mobilized by that institution. For instance, as an economic institution, the modern corporation vests its board of directors and executive officers with the authority to allocate and determine the use of any economic resources that the corporation owns or controls. Likewise, government vests specific public offices with the authority to employ administrative coercion or police force against anyone who fails to comply with the law. Similarly, as cultural institutions, schools and universities certify specific individuals as possessing expertise in particular fields of knowledge. In this sense, the individuals who occupy positions of institutional authority in a society control different types of power: economic power, political power, and ideological power and it is the authority to make institutionally binding decisions that makes an individual powerful. Thus, power can be imputed to particular groups of individuals to the degree that they occupy the decision-making positions of the organizations that control wealth, force, status, and knowledge in a particular society. A power structure consists of a patterned distribution of resources that is organized by the major institutions of a particular society (Barrow, 1993, 13–16).2 Thus, Mills claimed that: The power elite is composed of men … in positions to make decisions having major consequences … they are in command of the major hierarchies and organizations of modern society. They rule the big corporations. They run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. They occupy the strategic command posts of the social structure, in which are now centered the effective means of the power and the wealth and the celebrity which they enjoy. (Mills, 1956, 3–4)”翻译为中文","output":"最后，波兰察斯通过重新审视是否必须区分阶级权力和国家权力的问题来结束这场讨论。波兰察斯（1976a, 73）驳斥了米利班德的观点，后者认为国家机构必须被视为独立权力（即，强制力）的仓库，以保持自主性，波兰察斯称这只不过是一种公然的“向常识的呼吁”。波兰察斯没有直接回应理论论点，反而再次试图在意识形态上将自己与米利班德区分开来，坚称米利班德对国家权力的看法是“资产阶级社会科学和政治的一种古老且持久的观念”。仿佛要再次强调自己的观点，波兰察斯（1976, 76）通过结论性地说，在与米利班德的全部辩论中：“最终剩下的只是纯粹且简单的论战性口号，掩饰了一个事实和经验的批判。” 纯粹的马克思主义者与复杂的马克思主义者 在他的书《马克思主义者》(1962)中，美国社会学家C.赖特·米尔斯讽刺地区分了“纯粹的马克思主义”和“复杂的马克思主义”，这不仅预示了接下来十年的国家理论辩论，也无意中为该辩论最终充满误解奠定了舞台。因此，对波兰察斯和米利班德重新产生兴趣的同时，也引发了对C.赖特·米尔斯作品的“小而显著的复兴”的学术兴趣，并不是巧合，在此期间，马克思主义国家理论家因其作为一位庸俗“自愿主义者”的工作而拒绝了他的作品（阿隆诺维茨，2003）。对米尔斯对美国权力精英的揭露重新产生兴趣的政治原因也是，他描述的权力精英是由企业富人、军事军阀和奴性的政治指导团体紧密结合的联盟。 直接由上层阶级的子嗣在里根/布什政府期间（1980-1992）以民粹主义的说辞控制了美国国家政府，在布什二世政府期间（2000-2008）似乎暴露无遗（埃德莎尔，1984）。一次被窃取的选举（2000），企业腐败丑闻（安然公司，MCI），全球金融崩溃（2007-2009）以及一场不受欢迎的占领战争（伊拉克）——所有这些都以厚颜无耻的谎言为理由，使得米尔斯（1956, 343）声称“较高的不道德是美国精英的一个系统性特征”看起来异常及时（沃尔夫，1999）。因此，权力精英的观点再次在学者和普通公民中产生共鸣，即使中产阶级对这一切的自满使得米尔斯对美国人意识形态上的“无行动”描述恐怖地准确（米尔斯，1951，327）。结果，米尔斯的四本重要书籍在过去几年里都重新出版，每本都由一位著名学者撰写新的介绍，他的女儿们还首次公开发表了一系列他的个人信件，包括他的FBI档案。这种小而显著的回归米尔斯似乎在斯坦利·阿隆诺维茨（2004）编辑的对他的作品的三卷本重新评估中达到高潮，这也催生了2006年美国政治科学协会专门针对《权力精英》的小组讨论。更近期地，阿隆诺维茨（2012）出版了对“C.赖特·米尔斯和政治知识分子的塑造”的重新评估。 虽然对C.赖特·米尔斯的兴趣复苏是与波兰察斯-米利班德辩论的再次兴趣并行出现的，但人们还没有意识到这两种智力潮流实际上在C.赖特·米尔斯的《权力精英》中交汇，这本书实际上是尼科斯·波兰察斯在他最初确定“工具论”和“历史主义”为“扭曲马克思主义”的智力来源时批评的主要对象。在《政治权力与社会阶级》(1968)中，实际上是C.赖特·米尔斯成了波兰察斯方法论论战的对象，当时拉尔夫·米利班德的《资本主义社会中的国家》(1969)甚至还未出版，当波兰察斯的书的法语原版在1968年发布时。然而，同样有趣，也显然被遗忘的是，在20世纪50年代，当马克思主义者如保罗·M·斯威齐和赫伯特·阿普泰克对米尔斯提出批评时，马克思主义者和《权력精英》之间有过一次早期的遭遇，但以一种全然不同且更为建设性的结果。米尔斯与马克思主义者之间的第一次遭遇是一次热烈的交流，产生了政治理论方面的建设性进展，实际上，米利班德的《资本主义社会中的国家》至少部分是那次首次遭遇的结果。另一方面，在1970年代，波兰察斯通过将米利班德插入辩论来重演他早期对“自愿主义”和“工具论”的论战，仿佛他是米尔斯的理论孪生兄弟。在这方面，波兰察斯和结构主义马克思主义者未能认识到，像米利班德这样的英美马克思主义者，已经首先通过将他的许多实证进步纳入理论分析超越了米尔斯，其次，通过批评米尔斯缺乏政治经济学理论，因此，讽刺地，因未能将“结构”因素纳入其权力精英分析（巴罗，2007）。 权力精英与马克思主义 指出C.赖特·米尔斯在《权力精英》中的核心概念是“权力精英”，而不是“统治”或“资产阶级”这一点几乎不是什么新发现。然而，对于马克思主义者来说，米尔斯从韦伯的立场出发，认为社会由分析上独立且自主的经济、政治、社会和文化秩序组成，这一点一直是一个忧虑的来源（韦伯，1946）。米尔斯并未断言这些秩序之间存在固有的关系，而是认为任何此类的主张都是一个假设，直到通过实证社会学研究得出结论为止，以及在多大程度上可以证明。对马克思主义者的另一个关切是米尔斯的观点，认为是机构（而不是直接的阶级）通过赋予某些职位和占据这些职位的个人决策权来组织社会中的权力，权力决策权涉及如何部署该机构调动的关键资源。 例如，作为一个经济机构，现代公司赋予其董事会和执行官员决定如何分配和使用公司拥有或控制的任何经济资源的权力。同样，政府赋予特定的公共职务以权利，使用行政强制或警察力量对任何未能遵守法律的人。同样，作为文化机构，学校和大学认证特定个体在特定知识领域具有专业知识。从这个意义上讲，占据社会机构权威职位的个体控制着不同类型的权力：经济权力、政治权力和意识形态权力，是做出机构约束性决策的权力使一个人变得有权力。因此，可以认为特定个人群体具有权力，程度上他们占据控制特定社会的财富、力量、地位和知识的组织的决策职位。一个权力结构由特定社会的主要机构组织的资源的模式化分布构成（巴罗，1993, 13-16）。 因此，米尔斯声称： 权力精英由那些……处于能做出具有重大后果决定的位置的男人们组成……他们指挥着大公司。他们运营国家机器并声称其特权。他们指导军事建设。他们占据社会结构的战略指挥岗位，在那里现在集中了权力和财富以及他们享有的名望的有效手段。（米尔斯，1956, 3-4）"},{"instruction":"请将“However, Mills also emphasized that: Behind such men and behind the events of history, linking the two, are the major institutions of modern society. These hierarchies of state and corporation and army constitute the means of power; as such they are now of a consequence not before equaled in human history—and at their summits, there are now those command posts of modern society, which offer us the sociological key to an understanding of the role of the higher circles in America. (Mills, 1956, 5)3 Like many other liberals, the economist Robert Lekachman (1957, 270) was critical of The Power Elite, because he thought it contained too many “Marxist and Hobsonite echoes.” Indeed, he was not alone in wondering how Mills’ conception of a power elite controlling the means of power differed from Paul Sweezy’s (1942, 243) earlier declaration that the state is “an instrument in the hands of the ruling class for enforcing and guaranteeing the stability of the class structure itself.” However, C. Wright Mills was actually quite explicit about his perceived differences with the Marxists on two counts. First, in what is now a famous passage from The Power Elite, Mills rejected the term “ruling class” as an axiomatic statement that assumes what needs to be proven through empirical research. Mills (1956, fn. 277) claimed that: “Ruling class” is a badly loaded phrase. “Class” is an economic term; “rule” is a political one. The phrase, “ruling class” thus contains the theory that an economic class rules politically. That short-cut theory may or may not at times be true, but we do not want to carry that one rather simple theory about in the terms that we use to define our problems; we wish to state the theories explicitly, using terms of more precise and unilateral meaning. Specifically, the phrase “ruling class,” in its common political connotations, does not allow enough autonomy to the political order and its agents, and it says nothing about the military as such. It should be clear to the reader by now that we do not accept as adequate the simple view that high economic men unilaterally make all decisions of national consequences. We hold that such a simple view of “economic determinism” must be elaborated by “political determinism” and “military determinism”; that the higher agents of each of these three domains now often have a noticeable degree of autonomy; and that only in the often intricate ways of coalition do they make up and carry through the most important decisions. Those are the major reasons we prefer “power elite” to “ruling class” as a characterizing phrase for the higher circles when we consider them in terms of power. Thus, Mills argues that theoretically the economic, political, and military domains are each the source of an independent form of power, while empirically he was not convinced that the degree of cohesion and interlock among the three elites, or their subordination to economic elites, was sufficient to justify calling this power elite a ruling class, much less a ruling capitalist class. In a word, he (1956, 277) claims that “the simple Marxian view makes the big economic man the real holder of power; the simple liberal view makes the big political man the chief of the power system; and there are some who would view the warlords as virtual dictators.” Mills rejected each of these theoretical positions in defining a radical position between liberalism and Marxism. Yet, in responding directly to Lekachman’s comment, Mills (1957, 581) wrote: Let me say explicitly: I happen never to have been what is called “a Marxist,” but I believe Karl Marx is one of the most astute students of society modern civilization has produced; his work is now essential equipment of any adequately trained social scientist as well as of any properly educated person. Those who say they hear Marxian echoes in my work are saying that I have trained myself well. Second, while Mills never articulated, nor declared adherence to a particular economic theory, it is clear that he did not subscribe to Marxian economics and that, accordingly, he did not embrace its theory of surplus value and exploitation as a basis for explaining class struggle.4 In fact, Mills’ concept of power renders “the masses” powerless almost by fiat, since power is a function of occupying the command posts of the major institutions that control key resources. This is why early in his career Mills (1948) was hopeful that the “new men of power”—labor leaders at the commanding heights of large industrial unions—would become a progressive counter-elite in American society.5 However, when this expectation proved false, and the new men of power became secondary actors in the lower tier of the dominant power structure, what other sources of popular power were left in American society? In White Collar, Mills (1951, 328) had already written off the American middle classes as being “distracted from and inattentive to political concerns of any kind. They are strangers to politics. They are not radical, not liberal, not conservative, not reactionary; they are inactionary; they are out of it. If we accept the Greek’s definition of the idiot as a privatized man, then we must conclude that the U.S. citizenry is now largely composed of idiots.” Yet, paradoxically, in a chapter of The Power Elite on “Mass Society,” where Mills (1956, 300) dismisses pluralist theory “as a set of images out of a fairy tale,” he simultaneously concludes that “the Marxian doctrine of class struggle … certainly is now, closer to reality than any assumed harmony of interests.” Marxism and The Power Elite While C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite was harshly criticized by mainstream sociologists and political scientists in the United States, his book was embraced in Marxist and socialist circles primarily for strategic and political purposes. The Power Elite directly challenged the dominance of pluralist theory in sociology and political science (Truman, 1951) and it also captured the attention of the mainstream mass media, which celebrated Mills as the new l’enfant terrible of American social science. Consequently, while Marxists were critical of Mills’ work from a theoretical perspective, it was accorded a great deal of respect on the left well into the 1960s, because it opened an ideological space that allowed empirically and historically oriented Marxists to reenter a political discourse that had excluded them in the United States for at least two decades. For example, in a review in Commonweal, Michael Harrington proclaimed Mills “the most imaginative and brilliant of all the sociologists writing from American universities” (quoted in Aptheker, 1960, 9). Herbert Aptheker (1960, 9), a member of the National Committee of the U.S. Communist Party, affirmed Harrington’s sentiment as “a judgment which does not seem to me to be excessive.” Aptheker considered The Power Elite to be the magnum opus of America’s most brilliant sociologist. These views were echoed from across the Atlantic by Ralph Miliband (1962, 16), who proclaimed C. Wright Mills “the most interesting and controversial sociologist writing in the United States.” Miliband (1962, 16) praised The Power Elite as “a rich and intricate book. … There is room for debate about much of its detail. But I don’t think there is much room for serious debate about the book’s general thesis.” Paul Sweezy’s (1968, 118) review of The Power Elite in the Monthly Review (September, 1956) also exuded praise for the book with his declaration that he could not “pretend even to list all the book’s many excellencies.” Sweezy (1968, 132) concluded that “We should be grateful for such a good book.” Even though Mills was not a Marxist, Sweezy informed his readers that “Mills considers himself a socialist” and that was good enough for him (Cf. Miliband, 1964a, 77). Indeed, Sweezy (1968, 117) declaimed that “the greatest merit of The Power Elite is that it boldly breaks the tabu which respectable intellectual society has imposed on any serious discussion of how and by whom America is ruled … currently fashionable theories of the dispersal of power among many groups and interests [pluralism] have been bluntly challenged as flimsy apologetics.” In addition to breaking through the ideological mystique of pluralism, Sweezy identified three other major accomplishments of The Power Elite. First, the book was infused with “numerous flashes of insight and happy formulations” (Sweezy, 1968, 118), particularly “his damning description” of postwar intellectuals and his recognition that class consciousness is now “most apparent in the upper class,” rather than the working class. Second, Sweezy (1968, 119) praised Mills for having assembled and analyzed an impressive array of empirical data to support his main arguments, because it was his empirical research that had the potential to explode “some of the more popular and persistent myths about the rich and the powerful in America today.” Finally, and for the reasons already noted, Sweezy (1968, 119) was not the least bit concerned about Mills’ lack of Marxist terminology, but instead praised him for speaking “with the voice of an authentic American radicalism.” Sweezy (1968, 122) observed that “Mills’ theory is open to serious criticism. But he has the very great merit of bringing the real issues into the open and discussing them in a way that anyone can understand.” However, Sweezy’s admiration for The Power Elite was not without qualification. He criticized Mills on two points that became standard markers in defining Marxists’ relationship to Mills and their distance from him. First, Sweezy chided Mills (1968, 121) for not framing his discussion of the power elite’s higher immorality “in a context of exploitation, an indictment which Mills conspicuously fails to elaborate in any thorough or systematic way.” By viewing the corporate rich merely as decision makers occupying the command posts of corporations, Mills described their higher immorality as if it were the personal failing of corrupt and incompetent individuals, rather than a characteristic to be explained as part of the capitalist economic system. Without a theory of capitalist development, Sweezy (1968, 131) was concerned that Mills “goes much too far in the direction of what I may call ‘historical voluntarism’.” However, unlike Poulantzas a generation later, Sweezy does not offer up a rigid structuralism, but suggests that “What Mills could and should have argued in this connection is that the roles [of the power elite] are not like those of a theatrical performance, completely mapped out and rigidly determined in advance. The actors have a range of choice which is set by the nature and laws of the social structure under which they live.”6”翻译为中文","output":"然而，米尔斯也强调： 在这些男人背后，以及在历史事件的背后，连接二者的是现代社会的主要机构。这些国家、公司和军队的等级制度构成了权力的手段；作为这样的手段，它们现在的后果在人类历史上是前所未有的——在它们的顶端，现在有着现代社会的那些指挥岗位，这为我们理解高层圈子在美国的角色提供了社会学上的钥匙。（米尔斯，1956, 5） 像许多其他自由主义者一样，经济学家罗伯特·莱卡奇曼（1957, 270）对《权力精英》持批评态度，因为他认为它包含了太多“马克思主义和霍布森式的回声”。事实上，他并不是唯一一个对米尔斯关于权力精英控制权力手段的概念与保罗·斯威齐（1942, 243）早期声明国家是“统治阶级手中的工具，用于强制和保证阶级结构本身的稳定”有何不同感到疑惑的人。然而，C.赖特·米尔斯实际上对他与马克思主义者的看法差异在两个方面非常明确。 首先，在《权力精英》中一个现在广为人知的段落中，米尔斯拒绝了“统治阶级”这一术语，因为它假设了需要通过实证研究证明的东西。米尔斯（1956, 脚注277）声称： “统治阶级”是一个严重负担的短语。“阶级”是一个经济术语；“统治”是一个政治术语。因此，“统治阶级”这一短语含有经济阶级在政治上统治的理论。这一简化理论有时可能是真的，也可能不是，但我们不想在用以定义我们问题的术语中携带着这一相当简单的理论；我们希望明确地陈述理论，使用含义更精确且单一的术语。具体来说，“统治阶级”这一短语，在其常见的政治含义中，没有给政治秩序及其代理人留足足够的自主权，它对军队本身也毫无说明。读者现在应该清楚，我们不接受高层经济人单方面做出国家重大决策的简单观点为充分。我们认为，这种关于“经济决定论”的简单观点必须通过“政治决定论”和“军事决定论”来加以阐述；这三个领域的高层代理人现在通常有相当程度的自主权；并且只有通过联盟的通常复杂的方式，他们才形成并执行最重要的决策。这些是我们更喜欢使用“权力精英”而不是“统治阶级”作为描述高层圈子的特征短语时考虑到的权力方面的主要原因。 因此，米尔斯认为，理论上经济、政治和军事领域各自是一种独立的权力来源，而从经验上看，他不相信这三个精英之间的凝聚力和相互锁定程度，或它们对经济精英的从属程度足以将这个权力精英称之为统治阶级，更不用说是一个统治资本家阶级了。一言以蔽之，他（1956, 277）声称：“简单的马克思主义观点使大经济人成为实际的权力持有者；简单的自由主义观点使大政治人成为权力系统的首脑；也有一些人会将军阀视为虚拟的独裁者。”米尔斯在定义一个介于自由主义和马克思主义之间的激进立场时，拒绝了这些理论立场。然而，在直接回应莱卡奇曼的评论时，米尔斯（1957, 581）写道： 让我明确地说：我从未被称为“马克思主义者”，但我相信卡尔·马克思是现代文明产生的最敏锐的社会学家之一；他的工作现在是任何受过充分训练的社会科学家以及任何受过适当教育的人的基本装备。那些说他们在我的作品中听到马克思主义回声的人是在说我训练得很好。 第二，尽管米尔斯从未明确阐述或宣称遵循特定的经济理论，但很明显他并不订阅马克思经济学，因此，他也没有接受其剩余价值和剥削理论作为解释阶级斗争的基础。实际上，米尔斯对权力的概念几乎是命令性地使“大众”无力，因为权力是占据控制关键资源的主要机构指挥岗位的功能。这就是为什么在他职业生涯早期，米尔斯（1948）曾希望“新的权力人物”——在大型工业工会的指挥高地上的工会领袖——会成为美国社会中的一个进步反精英。然而，当这一期望被证明是错误的，新的权力人物成为主导权力结构底层的次要角色时，美国社会中还有哪些其他的普遍权力源泉呢？在《白领》中，米尔斯（1951, 328）已经将美国中产阶级定义为“对任何种类的政治关切都分心且不关心。他们是政治的陌生人。他们不是激进的，不是自由主义的，不是保守的，不是反动的；他们是无行动的；他们被排除在外。如果我们接受希腊人对于白痴作为一种私人化的人的定义，那么我们必须得出结论，美国公民现在大部分是由白痴组成的。”然而，矛盾的是，在《权力精英》关于“大众社会”的章节中，米尔斯（1956, 300）驳斥了多元主义理论“就像童话故事中的一组图像”，他同时得出结论，“马克思主义的阶级斗争学说……现在，比任何假定的利益和谐更接近于现实。”"},{"instruction":"请将“Marxism and The Power Elite While C.

But he has the very great merit of bringing the real issues into the open and discussing them in a way that anyone can understand.” However, Sweezy’s admiration for The Power Elite was not without qualification. He criticized Mills on two points that became standard markers in defining Marxists’ relationship to Mills and their distance from him. First, Sweezy chided Mills (1968, 121) for not framing his discussion of the power elite’s higher immorality “in a context of exploitation, an indictment which Mills conspicuously fails to elaborate in any thorough or systematic way.” By viewing the corporate rich merely as decision makers occupying the command posts of corporations, Mills described their higher immorality as if it were the personal failing of corrupt and incompetent individuals, rather than a characteristic to be explained as part of the capitalist economic system. Without a theory of capitalist development, Sweezy (1968, 131) was concerned that Mills “goes much too far in the direction of what I may call ‘historical voluntarism’.” However, unlike Poulantzas a generation later, Sweezy does not offer up a rigid structuralism, but suggests that “What Mills could and should have argued in this connection is that the roles [of the power elite] are not like those of a theatrical performance, completely mapped out and rigidly determined in advance. The actors have a range of choice which is set by the nature and laws of the social structure under which they live.”6 Whether Marxist or otherwise, Sweezy argued that Mills needed a theory of exploitation to explain the power elites’ behavior and its relation to the masses. Sweezy (1968, 121) mused that “Mills’ weaknesses in this connection are characteristically American,” but for this same reason he identified this problem as instructive on “the possibility and requirements of an effective American radical propaganda.” Sweezy’s main argument was that Mills’ book could just as easily be read in the same way that individuals follow celebrity gossip and the lifestyles of the rich and famous in various mass media. A mere statement of the facts would not spark outrage, much less political action. Americans are not shocked by the mere existence of spectacular wealth. They are not surprised by the excesses of celebrities or by the corruption of the powerful. In fact, they may well be entertained by it, or encouraged to buy an extra lottery ticket, on the faint hope that they too will become a Megamillions or Powerball winner, which is after all the epitome of modern day finance capitalism (Strange, 1986). Despite his impressive research, Sweezy did not believe that any of the facts revealed by Mills would speak for themselves, because they only find their meaning in the theoretical discovery that all this spectacle, excess, and corruption comes at that their expense; in other words, in a theory of exploitation that explains the spectacle of the higher immorality as a relation of exploitation between the very rich and the working masses. Thus, Sweezy (1968, 121) argued that mere denunciations of wealth will “fall on deaf ears” with the American public unless the accumulation and possession of great wealth is linked to a process of exploitation that can be replaced by alternative economic arrangements that have “more of it [i.e., wealth] to offer the great majority of them [i.e., the public] than has the present system of waste and plunder.” The purpose of Sweezy’s criticism was not to denounce Mills for not being a Marxist, nor to devalue his intellectual contribution, but to suggest a way to move his analysis a step forward theoretically and in a way that would further enhance its value as an ideology critique. It was fine with Sweezy if Mills did not embrace Marxian economics, but the problem was that Mills did not offer a theoretical alternative.7 Mills rejected Marxian economics, neo-classical economics, Keynesian economics, and institutional economics, but he never identified an alternative political economy in which to situate his sociological and cultural critique of the power elite. Sweezy offered a second observation about The Power Elite that quickly became the single most common theoretical criticism by critics of all persuasions. Sweezy developed an immanent critique of The Power Elite based on Mills’ own empirical findings. He argued that Mills’ hypothesis regarding the autonomy of the three domains of power had actually occluded his ability to see the facts as Mills presented them throughout his book. Sweezy (1968, 124) argues that Mills: adduces a wealth of material on our class system, showing how the local units of the upper class are made up of propertied families and how these local units are welded together into a wholly self-conscious national class. He shows the “power elite” is overwhelmingly (and increasingly) recruited from the upper levels of the class system, how the same families contribute indifferently to the economic, military, and political “elites,” and how the same individuals move easily and almost imperceptibly back and forth from one to another of these “elites.” When it comes to “The Political Directorate” (chapter 10), he demonstrates that the notion of a specifically political elite is in reality a myth, that the crucial positions in government and politics are increasingly held by what he calls “political outsiders,” and that these outsiders are in fact members or errand boys of the corporate rich. Sweezy (1968, 125) goes on to argue that “on his own showing the ‘political directorate’ is largely an appendage of the corporate rich,” and even with respect to the alleged ascendancy of the warlords, he notes that: the military has swelled enormously in size and power, but it is precisely then that it has ceased to be a separate domain. The civilian higher circles have moved into commanding military positions, and the top brass has been accepted into the higher circles. What happens in such times is that the “power elite” becomes militarized in the sense that it has to concern itself with military problems, it requires military skills, and it must inculcate in the underlying population greater respect for military virtues and personnel.”翻译为中文","output":"马克思主义与《权力精英》 尽管C.赖特·米尔斯的《权力精英》在美国受到主流社会学家和政治学家的严厉批评，但他的书籍在马克思主义和社会主义圈子里主要出于战略和政治目的而受到欢迎。《权力精英》直接挑战了社会学和政治科学中多元主义理论的主导地位（Truman, 1951），同时也吸引了主流大众媒体的注意，他们将米尔斯誉为美国社会科学的新“可怕孩子”。因此，虽然马克思主义者从理论角度批评米尔斯的工作，但直到1960年代，他的工作在左翼界仍受到极大尊重，因为它开辟了一个意识形态空间，让以实证和历史为导向的马克思主义者得以重新进入在美国至少两十年来排除他们的政治话语中。 例如，在《Commonweal》的一篇评论中，迈克尔·哈灵顿宣称米尔斯是“所有来自美国大学撰写的社会学家中最富有想象力和最杰出的”(引用自Aptheker, 1960, 9)。美国共产党的全国委员会成员赫伯特·阿普泽克（Aptheker, 1960, 9）认同哈灵顿的观点，并称之为“一个我认为并不过分的判断”。阿普泽克认为《权力精英》是美国最杰出的社会学家的杰作。拉尔夫·米利班德（1962, 16）从大西洋彼岸回响这一观点，他宣布C.赖特·米尔斯是“美国写作中最有趣和最具争议的社会学家。”米利班德（1962, 16）称赞《权力精英》是“一本丰富而复杂的书……其细节有很多讨论空间。但我认为对这本书的总体论点进行严肃辩论的空间不多。” 保罗·斯威齐（1968, 118）在《月刊评论》（1956年9月）对《权力精英》的评论也对这本书给予了高度赞扬，他宣称自己甚至不能“假装列出该书的所有优点。”斯威齐（1968, 132）总结说，“我们应该感激这样一本好书。” 尽管米尔斯不是马克思主义者，斯威齐告诉读者“米尔斯认为自己是社会主义者”而这对他来说已足够（参见Miliband, 1964a, 77）。实际上，斯威齐（1968, 117）声称“《权力精英》的最大优点是，它大胆打破了尊敬的知识界对任何严肃讨论如何以及由谁统治美国的禁忌……目前流行的权力在许多团体和利益之间分散的理论[多元主义]被直截了当地质疑为脆弱的辩解。” 除了打破多元主义的意识形态神秘主义，斯威齐识别出《权力精英》的另外三个主要成就。首先，这本书充满了“众多的洞察力和愉快的表达”（斯威齐，1968, 118），特别是“他对战后知识分子的痛苦描述”以及他认识到阶级意识现在“在上层阶级中最为明显”，而不是在工人阶级中。其次，斯威齐（1968, 119）称赞米尔斯汇编和分析了一系列令人印象深刻的实证数据来支持他的主要论点，因为正是他的实证研究有可能破除“当今美国关于富人和有权势者的一些更流行和持久的神话。” 最后，正如前面已经提到的，斯威齐（1968, 119）对米尔斯缺乏马克思主义术语一点也不担心，反而赞扬他“以真正的美国激进主义者的声音”发言。斯威齐（1968, 122）观察到：“米尔斯的理论面临严峻批评。但他有非常大的优点，即把真正的问题公之于众，并以任何人都能理解的方式讨论它们。” 然而，斯威齐对《权力精英》的赞赏并非毫无保留。他在两点上批评米尔斯，这两点成为定义马克思主义者与米尔斯的关系及他们之间距离的标准标记。首先，斯威齐（1968, 121）批评米尔斯没有在剥削的背景下讨论权力精英的高级不道德行为，“这是米尔斯明显未能以任何彻底或系统的方式详细阐述的指控。”通过将企业富豪仅视为占据公司指挥岗位的决策者，米尔斯描述他们的高级不道德行为似乎是腐败和无能个人的个人失败，而不是作为资本主义经济系统的一部分来解释的特征。没有资本主义发展理论，斯威齐（1968, 131）担心米尔斯“在我所说的‘历史自由意志主义’方向上走得太远。”然而，与一代人后的波兰察斯不同，斯威齐没有提出一种僵化的结构主义，而是建议“米尔斯在这方面本可以并且本应该争辩说，[权力精英的]角色并不像戏剧表演中的角色，完全预先规划并严格确定。演员们有一定选择范围，由他们生活的社会结构的性质和法律设定。” 无论是不是马克思主义者，斯威齐认为米尔斯需要一个剥削理论来解释权力精英的行为及其与大众的关系。斯威齐（1968, 121）沉思道，“米尔斯在这方面的弱点是典型的美国特征”，但因为同样的原因，他认为这个问题对“有效的美国激进宣传的可能性和要求”具有启示性。斯威齐的主要论点是，米尔斯的书很容易以同样的方式被阅读，就像个人在各种大众媒体中追踪名人八卦和富人名流的生活方式一样。单纯陈述事实不会激发愤怒，更不用说政治行动了。美国人对壮观财富的单纯存在并不感到震惊。他们对名人的过度行为或有权势者的腐败并不感到惊讶。实际上，他们可能会被它娱乐，或鼓励他们购买额外的彩票，怀着微弱的希望他们也会成为百万富翁或权力球赢家，毕竟这是现代金融资本主义的典范（Strange, 1986）。尽管斯威齐的研究令人印象深刻，但他不相信米尔斯揭示的任何事实本身就足以说明问题，因为它们只有在理论上发现所有这些壮观、过度和腐败是以他们的代价为代价时才有意义；换句话说，通过一个解释高级不道德行为壮观秀为非常富有者和工人大众之间剥削关系的剥削理论。 因此，斯威齐（1968, 121）认为，单纯地谴责财富会“对美国公众充耳不闻”，除非财富的积累和拥有与一个可以被替代的经济安排过程联系起来，这个过程对于他们中的大多数人[即公众]比现有的浪费和掠夺系统“提供更多的[即财富]”。斯威齐批评的目的不是为了谴责米尔斯不是马克思主义者，也不是为了贬低他的智力贡献，而是为了建议从理论上推进他的分析，并以一种能进一步增强其作为意识形态批判价值的方式。对斯威齐来说，如果米尔斯不接受马克思经济学也无所谓，但问题在于米尔斯没有提供一个理论上的替代。米尔斯拒绝了马克思经济学、新古典经济学、凯恩斯经济学和制度经济学，但他从未确定一个替代的政治经济学，以此为基础来定位他对权力精英的社会学和文化批判。 斯威齐对《权力精英》提出了第二个观察，很快成为所有批评者最常见的理论批评。斯威齐基于米尔斯自己的实证发现，对《权力精英》进行了内在批判。他认为米尔斯关于三个权力领域自治的假设实际上遮蔽了他看到米尔斯在整本书中呈现的事实的能力。斯威齐（1968, 124）认为米尔斯： 提供了大量关于我们的阶级体系的材料，展示了上层阶级的地方单位是如何由拥有财产的家庭组成，以及这些地方单位是如何被整合成一个完全自我意识的全国阶级。他展示了“权力精英”绝大多数（而且越来越多地）从阶级体系的上层水平中招募而来，同一家庭无差别地为经济、军事和政治“精英”贡献，以及同一些个人如何轻易地几乎不易察觉地在这些“精英”中来回转换。当谈到“政治指导阶层”（第10章）时，他证明了特定政治精英的概念实际上是一个神话，政府和政治中的关键职位越来越多地由他称之为“政治局外人”担任，而这些局外人实际上是企业富豪或其跑腿的成员。 斯威齐（1968, 125）继续认为，根据他自己的论证，“政治指导阶层”在很大程度上是企业富豪的附属物，甚至对于所谓的战争领主的优势地位，他指出： 军队在规模和权力上极大膨胀，但正是在那时，它不再是一个独立领域。文职高层圈子已进入军事指挥职位，高级军官已被接纳进高层圈子。在这样的时代，发生的是“权力精英”在必须关注军事问题、需要军事技能，并且必须在基层民众中培养对军事美德和人员更大尊重意义上的军事化。"},{"instruction":"请将“Thus, Sweezy (1968, 129) concludes that “the facts simply won’t fit Mills’ theory of three (or two) sectional elites coming together to form an overall power elite. What we have in the United States is a ruling class with its roots deeply sunk in the ‘apparatus of appropriation’ which is the corporate system.” Consequently, Sweezy (1968, 127) points out that even though Mills’ analysis was “strongly influenced by a straightforward class theory,” he did not consistently explore the implications of his empirical findings, which would have taken him closer to a Marxian position (Cf. Balbus, 1971). Similarly, Tom Bottomore was another of the many critics who claimed that Mills’ own research findings revealed that most members of the power elite were in fact drawn from a socially recognized upper class. Bottomore (1966, 33–34) observes that Mills starts with the hypothesis that he will leave open the question of whether the power elite represents a class that rules through the elites, but when he returns to this theoretical problem late in the book, “it is only to reject the Marxist idea of a ruling class. … In short, the question is never seriously discussed, and this is a curious failing.”8 Robert Lynd (1968, 107) identifies Mills’ failure to engage this discussion as “the colossal loose-end of The Power Elite.” Lynd was not alone in his assessment for it is a criticism that reappears again and again in reviews of the book by scholars of every ideological persuasion.9 Herbert Aptheker draws out a number of additional issues stemming from Mills not having a theory of capitalist development and he illustrates how this lacuna limited Mills’ ability to conceptualize both the power elite and subaltern classes. Aptheker reiterates all of Sweezy’s arguments in his analysis of The Power Elite, but he goes further than Sweezy in criticizing the limitations of Mills’ analysis. Although Aptheker (1960, 34) chastised Mills for not including Lenin among the authors that every educated person should read, his substantive point was that Mills’ conception of the economic elite as an amalgam of the “very rich” and the “corporate rich” failed to capture the emerging role of finance capital and financial groups as the emerging vanguard of the capitalist class. The “economic elite” was more than an aggregation of rich families and corporate executives, but was itself structured internally by developments in the capitalist economy.10 Aptheker (1960, 20) chided Mills not just for failing to interpret his empirical findings correctly, but for ignoring “the central depository of power—the financial overlords.” Mills was unable to recognize finance capitalists as the overlords of the power elite, precisely because his analysis was not structured by any concept of political economy. He saw corporations, but not capitalism; corporate elites, but not a capitalist class. Not surprisingly, Aptheker’s critique was theoretically grounded in Lenin’s Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism and, indirectly, in Rudolf Hilferding’s Finance Capital: The Latest Stage of Capitalism. Thus, Aptheker (1960, 35) attributed Mills’ theoretical blind spot to his “neglect of Lenin,” but he also took Mills to task for failing to even acknowledge the significant work of contemporary Marxist scholars, such as Victor Perlo (1950) and Paul Sweezy (1953, Chaps. 9, 12), who had published empirical research on American imperialism and the American ruling class, respectively. However, even putting this ideological quibble aside, Aptheker was amazed that Mills could have missed an already substantial body of empirical literature on financial groups and monopoly capital that owed nothing to Marxism. As early as 1939, the National Resources Committee had published The Structure of the American Economy (Means, 1939), which used a rigorous power structure methodology to document that the U.S. economy was dominated by eight major “financial groups” (three national and five regional). This government report was based partly on research conducted by Paul Sweezy (1953, Chap. 12), which identified a network of financial groups that each consisted of several large industrial corporations under common control with the locus of power usually being an investment or commercial bank or a great family fortune (Cf. Baran and Sweezy, 1966, 17).11 The internal structure of each financial group was dominated by one or more financial institutions, which sat atop each group and organized it through interlocking directors, loans, bond and securities underwriting, lines of credit, and so on. (Barrow, 1993, 18–21; Mintz and Schwarz, 1985). This idea was picked up again in 1941 and received a great deal of publicity during the highly publicized hearings of the Temporary National Economic Committee.12 Moreover, even during the time that Mills was conducting research for The Power Elite, the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary released a highly publicized Study of Monopoly Power (1951–1952) and two reports on Bank Mergers and Concentration of Banking Facilities (1952, 1955).13 Aptheker’s point was that the concept of “finance capital” as an organizing principle of the capitalist economy was by no means inherently “Marxist” and that Mills had other more populist or even empirical paths to that concept. However, according to Aptheker (1960, 34), Mills was simply blind to the “intensification of the domination of the sinews of capitalism by the banking collosi and to the mounting merger movement among the banks themselves.” Hence, Mills had missed a key factor of class cohesion within the economic elite. In contrast, Aptheker (1960, 35) argues that finance capital “is the apex of power today in the United States, and its absence from Mills’ Power Elite seriously hurts the book’s validity from the viewpoint of sheer description as well as basic definition” (Cf., Zeitlin, 1977, Chaps. 1–5; 1980, Chaps. 2–4). For Aptheker, there were several additional problems that emanated from this theoretical and empirical lacuna. The orthodox Marxist-Leninist analysis saw finance capital as the engine of a new “epoch of imperialism” (Perlo, 1957), which was defined primarily by the internationalization of American capital (Aptheker, 1960, 36). In other words, the power elite was no longer simply an “American” power elite, but one with interests, connections, and structural limitations related to its export of capital. Aptheker contends that Mills’ failure to analyze the economic underpinnings of imperial expansion seriously weakened his ability to understand the “military ascendancy” of the warlords or to grasp the structural and institutional basis of the power elite’s foreign policy. Instead, Mills tended to present the power elite’s new foreign adventures as a cynical form of Beardian “diversion” to entertain and distract the masses, rather than part of the process of capitalist development (see Barrow, 1997). Whether one shared a Marxist viewpoint or not, the importance of this theoretical linkage was that it allowed Aptheker to elaborate the political, as opposed to the methodological, significance of Sweezy’s complaint about Mills’ “historical voluntarism.” Aptheker (1960, 19) also chastised Mills for depicting “the power elite as, in fact, and despite some qualification, all-powerful” and thus depicting the masses of people as generally powerless. Aptheker was concerned that Mills had constructed an exaggerated image of the power elite’s omnipotence, precisely because he does not incorporate “class” and “class conflict” into his theoretical apparatus. In some ways, Mills reproduces the power elite’s own worst delusions about the magnitude of its power, while simultaneously undercutting those delusions with satirical observations about its incompetence and mediocrity. However, Aptheker does not merely offer up the concept of “class conflict” as an ideological epithet for dismissing Mills. He elaborates how an empirical and historical analysis of class conflict would have allowed Mills to see the limitations and contradictions of power in the higher circles. Aptheker (1960, 24–25) argues that: between the will of that elite and its capabilities of implementing that will stands public opinion, including American public opinion. This public opinion is not simply shaped by the elite, and this public opinion does affect what the elite tries to do and what it does and how it does what it does. Moreover, in whole areas of life—as in wages and working conditions, housing and education, the battle against Jim Crow and against war—the desires and power of the masses do exert great influence, manifested in buses that stop running and in atomic bombs that, though loaded aboard planes that are alerted to take off, never are dropped in war. Aptheker was theoretically more attuned to the subterranean movements within American society that at the time were invisible to Mills. Even in 1956, there was a small anti-nuclear movement and a peace movement. There was a burgeoning civil rights movement that was expanding into a poor peoples’ movement. There were still progressives, and even socialists and communists, in American trade unions. In sum, it was Aptheker’s (1960, 20) contention that Mills had overstated the success of “the elite’s effort to make all Americans morally as corrupt as the elite themselves.” There were poor people, African-Americans, and ordinary middle-class Americans who struggled day-to-day to make a living and who did not share the power elite’s war-mongering ways or its self-absorption with conspicuous consumption. In this sense, Mills’ conception of a power elite dominating “the masses” obscured the fact that there were not just very rich people in America, but poor and very poor people in America (Aptheker, 1960, 12). It was not enough to challenge Louis Hartz’s (1955) America as a middle-class thesis by demonstrating the existence of “the very rich,” because this critique still ignored the fact that the United States had an underclass of the poor and very poor and that much of this underclass was racialized and gendered (Harrington, 1962).”翻译为中文","output":"因此，斯威齐（1968, 129）得出结论：“事实根本无法符合米尔斯关于三个（或两个）部门精英汇聚形成一个整体权力精英的理论。我们在美国实际上拥有的是一个根植于‘占有机制’—即企业系统的统治阶级。”因此，斯威齐（1968, 127）指出，尽管米尔斯的分析“受到了直接阶级理论的强烈影响”，但他并未一贯探索其实证发现的含义，这本可以使他更接近马克思主义立场（参见Balbus, 1971）。 类似地，汤姆·博托莫尔是众多批评者之一，他们声称米尔斯自己的研究发现揭示了大多数权力精英成员实际上来自社会公认的上层阶级。博托莫尔（1966, 33-34）观察到米尔斯以一个假设开始，即他将保留权力精英是否代表通过精英统治的阶级这一问题的答案开放，但当他在书的后期回到这个理论问题时，“只是拒绝了马克思关于统治阶级的观点......简而言之，这个问题从未被严肃讨论，这是一个奇怪的缺陷。”罗伯特·林德（1968, 107）认为米尔斯未能参与这一讨论是《权力精英》中“巨大的遗漏”。林德并不是唯一做出这种评估的人，因为这是一种在每种意识形态观点的学者对该书的评价中反复出现的批评。 赫伯特·阿普泽克提出了一些额外的问题，这些问题源于米尔斯没有资本主义发展理论，他展示了这个空白限制了米尔斯概念化权力精英和次级阶层的能力。阿普泽克在对《权力精英》的分析中重申了斯威齐的所有论点，但他在批评米尔斯的分析限制方面比斯威齐走得更远。尽管阿普泽克（1960, 34）斥责米尔斯未将列宁列入每个受过教育的人应该阅读的作者之中，他的实质性观点是米尔斯将经济精英视为“非常富有”的和“企业富有”的混合体，未能捕捉到作为资本家阶级前卫的金融资本和金融集团的新兴角色。“经济精英”不仅仅是富裕家庭和公司高管的聚集，而是由资本主义经济发展内部构建的。 阿普泽克（1960, 20）批评米尔斯不仅是因为他未能正确解释他的实证发现，而且因为他忽视了“权力的中心存储库——金融霸主。”正是因为米尔斯的分析没有被任何政治经济学概念构架，他无法认出金融资本家是权力精英的霸主。他看到了企业却看不到资本主义；看到了企业精英却看不到资本家阶级。毫不奇怪，阿普泽克的批评理论上基于列宁的《帝国主义：资本主义的最高阶段》和间接地基于鲁道夫·希尔费丁的《金融资本：资本主义的最新阶段》。因此，阿普泽克（1960, 35）将米尔斯的理论盲点归咎于他“忽视了列宁”，但他还因米尔斯未能承认像维克多·佩尔洛（1950）和保罗·斯威齐（1953，第9、12章）这样的当代马克思主义学者的重要工作而批评米尔斯，他们分别发表了关于美国帝国主义和美国统治阶级的实证研究。 然而，即便将这种意识形态上的小瑕疵搁置一旁，阿普泽克对米尔斯竟然错过了一个已经相当丰富的关于金融集团和垄断资本的实证文献而感到惊讶，这些文献与马克思主义无关。早在1939年，国家资源委员会就发布了《美国经济结构》（Means, 1939），该报告使用严格的权力结构方法论，记录了美国经济被八个主要的“金融集团”（三个全国性和五个地区性）所主导。这份政府报告部分基于保罗·斯威齐（1953, 第12章）进行的研究，该研究识别了一个金融集团网络，每个集团由几个大型工业公司在共同控制下组成，权力中心通常是投资或商业银行或一个大家族财富。每个金融集团的内部结构由一个或多个金融机构主导，这些机构通过交叉董事、贷款、债券和证券承销、信贷额度等坐在每个集团的顶端并组织它。（Barrow, 1993, 18-21; Mintz和Schwarz, 1985）。这一观点在1941年再次被提出，并在备受瞩目的临时全国经济委员会听证会期间获得了大量宣传。此外，甚至在米尔斯为《权力精英》进行研究的时候，美国众议院司法委员会发布了备受关注的《垄断权力研究》（1951-1952）和两份关于银行合并和银行设施集中的报告（1952, 1955）。"},{"instruction":"请将“Aptheker’s point was that the concept of “finance capital” as an organizing principle of the capitalist economy was by no means inherently “Marxist” and that Mills had other more populist or even empirical paths to that concept.

This public opinion is not simply shaped by the elite, and this public opinion does affect what the elite tries to do and what it does and how it does what it does.

In this sense, Mills’ conception of a power elite dominating “the masses” obscured the fact that there were not just very rich people in America, but poor and very poor people in America (Aptheker, 1960, 12). It was not enough to challenge Louis Hartz’s (1955) America as a middle-class thesis by demonstrating the existence of “the very rich,” because this critique still ignored the fact that the United States had an underclass of the poor and very poor and that much of this underclass was racialized and gendered (Harrington, 1962). Moreover, Aptheker’s theoretical lens also made him far more attentive to the liberation struggles in what was then called the “Third World.” Here, too, Aptheker (1960, 27) argues that Mills’ inability to recognize the significance of the internationalization of capital as the economic basis of American foreign policy meant that Mills could not see that American public opinion was important, but also that world public opinion, splits among the imperialist partners, and divisions in the opinions of the American elite were also potent forces in constraining the power elite. These factors had all played a role in staying the hand of Mills’ “Military Ascendancy.” In sum, the main point for Aptheker (1960, 29) was “that the elite are by no means omnipotent, and the masses of people in our country are neither powerless nor apathetic.” Finally, Aptheker suggests that the absence of a theory of capitalist development in Mills’ work generates an additional blind spot concerning the role of the U.S. South in American political and economic development. Aptheker’s contention was that race and neo-conservatism had a deeper basis in historical class development than Mills recognized in his analysis of the 1950s “conservative mood.” Aptheker (1960, 11) suggests that Mills would have arrived at different conclusions had he recognized that “there was a relative, not absolute, absence of feudal forms and institutions here—they were, for example, important in upstate New York and in Maryland—and that there was a prefeudal form in our history, chattel slavery, which played a decisive role in American development through the Civil War, just as some of its survivals exert so decisive an influence upon present-day American life.” This was not just a historical quibble, but an omission with profound theoretical implications. First, this lacuna in Mills’ analysis creates a blind spot to the question of race in America. Aptheker (1960, 11–12) laments “Mills’ consistent ignoring of the Negro question in all his writings.” Hence, he misses what was already becoming an important structural base for progressive political action in the United States. Second, this lacuna also leads Mills to ignore the structural basis of traditional conservatism in America—strongly located in the South, but extended more generally throughout the rural and suburban hinterlands of white America. Aptheker observes presciently that what Mills dismissed as a short-term “conservative mood” actually had a deep historical basis in the American social structure—one that was tied historically to race and region—and that would not abate with a changing political mood. Thus, while Mills states that “there can be no conservative ideology of the classic type” in America, Aptheker (1960, 16) identifies this claim as a significant error “stemming from Mills’ complete ignoring of Southern life and history and the realities of a kind of industrial feudalism in U.S. development.” Indeed, this is a serious omission for a sociologist of knowledge so deeply influenced by Karl Mannheim. Finally, Aptheker (1960, 14 fn.) criticizes Mills generally for failing to cite “American Marxist writers, though their work anticipates and expands much of his own.” Despite Mills’ “bare and very brief allusions” to Marx and Marxism in The Power Elite, Aptheker (1960, 15) was hopeful that “perhaps in a future work Mills will yet face up fully to the challenge of Marxism by testing its propositions against American reality as he sees it today.” In this respect, a significant feature of Aptheker’s critique is a genuine effort to engage Mills theoretically based on a discussion of empirical and historical facts—whether by reinterpretation or omission—rather than through conceptual one-upmanship based on ideological prescriptions or party doctrine. One simply does not find the types of ideological epithets—“distorted Marxism,” “semi-Marxism,” or “would-be Marxism”—that became so common in the Poulantzas-Miliband debate and its aftermath in the 1970s. Sweezy’s and Aptheker’s criticisms are meant to build on and extend Mills’ work, rather than dismiss it as part of some sterile abstract jargon-laded polemic. ”翻译为中文","output":"阿普泽克认为，“金融资本”作为资本主义经济的组织原则的概念绝不是固有的“马克思主义”，而且米尔斯对该概念有着更多民粹主义甚至是实证主义的途径。然而，根据阿普泽克（1960, 34）的说法，米尔斯对“银行巨头加剧对资本主义要害的控制以及银行本身之间不断增加的合并运动”完全视而不见。因此，米尔斯错过了经济精英内部阶级凝聚的一个关键因素。相比之下，阿普泽克（1960, 35）认为，金融资本“是当今美国权力的顶峰，其在米尔斯的《权力精英》中的缺席，严重损害了该书从纯粹描述和基本定义的角度的有效性”（参考Zeitlin, 1977, 第1-5章；1980, 第2-4章）。 对于阿普泽克来说，这一理论和实证的空白产生了几个额外的问题。正统的马克思列宁主义分析将金融资本视为新的“帝国主义时代”的引擎（Perlo, 1957），这主要是由美国资本的国际化所定义。换句话说，权力精英不再仅仅是一个“美国”的权力精英，而是一个与其资本输出有关的利益、联系和结构限制的精英。阿普泽克认为，米尔斯未能分析帝国主义扩张的经济基础，严重削弱了他理解战争领主的“军事上升”或把握权力精英外交政策的结构和制度基础的能力。相反，米尔斯倾向于将权力精英的新外国冒险呈现为一种讽刺的比尔德式“转移”，以娱乐和分散大众的注意力，而不是资本主义发展过程的一部分（参见Barrow, 1997）。无论是否持有马克思主义观点，这一理论联系的重要性在于，它使阿普泽克能够阐述斯威齐对米尔斯“历史自由意志主义”抱怨的政治意义，而非方法论意义。 阿普泽克（1960, 19）还批评米尔斯将“权力精英描述为事实上，并且尽管有一些限制，却是全能的”，因此将普通民众描述为普遍无力的。阿普泽克担心，米尔斯因为没有将“阶级”和“阶级冲突”纳入他的理论框架，而构建了权力精英全能的夸张形象。在某些方面，米尔斯复制了权力精英对其权力程度的最糟糕错觉，同时又通过讽刺性的观察来削弱这些错觉，这些观察涉及其无能和平庸。然而，阿普泽克并非仅将“阶级冲突”概念作为驳斥米尔斯的意识形态标签。他详细说明，如何通过对阶级冲突的实证和历史分析，让米尔斯看到高层圈子中权力的限制和矛盾。 阿普泽克（1960, 24-25）认为： 在那个精英的意愿与其实现那意愿的能力之间，站着包括美国公众舆论在内的公众舆论。这种公众舆论并非简单地由精英塑造，而且这种公众舆论确实影响了精英试图做什么、他们做了什么以及他们如何做他们所做的事情。此外，在生活的整个领域中——如工资和工作条件、住房和教育、反对吉姆·克劳法和反战——大众的愿望和力量确实产生了巨大影响，这体现在停运的公交车和虽然装载在准备起飞的飞机上却在战争中从未投下的原子弹上。 阿普泽克在理论上更加关注于当时对米尔斯来说不可见的美国社会中的地下运动。即使在1956年，就已经有了一个小型的反核运动和和平运动。民权运动正在蓬勃发展成为一个穷人运动。在美国工会中仍有进步人士，甚至社会主义者和共产主义者。总之，阿普泽克（1960, 20）的观点是，米尔斯夸大了“精英努力使所有美国人道德上像精英本身一样腐败”的成功。有贫困人口、非裔美国人和普通的中产阶级美国人，他们每天为生计而奋斗，他们不分享权力精英的好战方式或其对显眼消费的自我吸收。从这个意义上讲，米尔斯对权力精英主导“大众”的概念，掩盖了美国不仅仅有非常富有的人，还有穷人和非常穷的人的事实（阿普泽克，1960, 12）。将路易斯·哈茨（1955）的美国是一个中产阶级论文挑战，并证明“非常富有”的存在是不够的，因为这一批判仍然忽略了美国有一个穷人和非常穷的底层阶级这一事实，而这个底层阶级在很大程度上是种族化和性别化的（哈灵顿，1962）。 此外，阿普泽克的理论视角也使他更加关注所谓的“第三世界”的解放斗争。阿普泽克（1960, 27）认为，米尔斯无法认识到资本国际化作为美国外交政策经济基础的重要性，意味着米尔斯无法看到美国公众舆论很重要，但世界公众舆论、帝国主义伙伴之间的分歧以及美国精英意见的分歧也是限制权力精英的强大力量。这些因素都在阻止米尔斯所谓的“军事上升”的手。总之，阿普泽克（1960, 29）的主要观点是“精英绝非全能，而我们国家的大众也不是无力的，也不是冷漠的。” 最后，阿普泽克指出，米尔斯作品中缺少对资本主义发展理论的探讨，产生了一个额外的盲点，关于美国南部在美国政治和经济发展中的作用。阿普泽克认为，种族和新保守主义在历史阶级发展中有着比米尔斯在分析1950年代的“保守情绪”时所认识到的更深层基础。阿普泽克（1960, 11）提示说，如果米尔斯认识到“这里有相对的、而不是绝对的封建形式和制度的缺失——例如，它们在纽约州北部和马里兰州很重要——还有我们历史上的一种前封建形式，奴隶制，在美国发展中直到内战发挥了决定性作用，就像一些其残余影响对当今美国生活产生如此决定性影响一样。”这不仅仅是一个历史上的小争议，而是一个具有深远理论意义的遗漏。 首先，米尔斯分析中的这一空白创造了对美国种族问题的盲点。阿普泽克（1960, 11-12）哀叹“米尔斯在他所有的著作中一贯忽视了黑人问题。”因此，他错过了已经成为美国进步政治行动重要结构基础的东西。其次，这一空白还导致米尔斯忽视了传统保守主义在美国的结构基础——强烈位于南部，但更普遍地扩展到整个美国白人的农村和郊区腹地。阿普泽克预见性地观察到，米尔斯所轻视的短期“保守情绪”实际上在美国社会结构中有着深刻的历史基础——一个与种族和地区历史联系在一起的基础，并不会随着政治情绪的变化而消退。因此，虽然米尔斯声称“在美国不存在经典类型的保守意识形态”，阿普泽克（1960, 16）认定这一观点是一个重大错误，“这源于米尔斯对南方生活和历史以及美国发展中一种工业封建主义现实的完全忽视。”确实，对于一个深受卡尔·曼海姆影响的知识社会学家来说，这是一个严重的遗漏。 最后，阿普泽克（1960, 14 脚注）普遍批评米尔斯未能引用“美国马克思主义作家，尽管他们的工作预见并扩展了他自己的许多内容。”尽管米尔斯在《权力精英》中对马克思和马克思主义有“简短而非常简略的提及”，阿普泽克（1960, 15）希望“也许在未来的作品中，米尔斯将完全面对马克思主义的挑战，通过测试其命题对抗他今天所看到的美国现实。”在这方面，阿普泽克批评的一个显著特点是基于对实证和历史事实的讨论（无论是重新解释还是遗漏），而不是基于意识形态处方或党的教条的概念竞争，努力从理论上参与米尔斯。在20世纪70年代的波兰察斯-米利班德辩论及其后果中，不会发现变得如此普遍的意识形态标签——“扭曲的马克思主义”，“半马克思主义”，或“假装的马克思主义”。斯威齐和阿普泽克的批评意在建立在米尔斯的工作基础上并扩展它，而不是将其作为某种空洞的抽象术语辩论的一部分轻易驳回。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, there are a few conceptual and technical aspects that need attention for the code to run effectively and meet its intended purpose. # 1. Applying Functions Efficiently Applying your custom functions (\`macd\`, \`twin_range_filter\`, \`detect_engulfing\`) with \`.apply()\` row-by-row is extremely inefficient and will likely result in very long execution times, especially for larger datasets like financial time series. These techniques should ideally work with entire series (or DataFrames) for vectorized operations, which are significantly faster. Unfortunately, the way these functions are structured (e.g., \`twin_range_filter\` and \`detect_engulfing\`) inherently requires a sequential approach, which makes vectorization difficult without rethinking the logic. # 2. Function Return Values Your functions for signals (\`macd\`, \`twin_range_filter\`, \`detect_engulfing\`) are designed to return a signal based on the final row of the DataFrame passed to them. However, when applied row-by-row as in your code, they are not returning an appendable signal for each row but are instead trying to make a decision based on the entire sliced DataFrame up to the current row. This not only is inefficient but also incorrectly attempts to recursively reapply the logic for increasingly larger subsets of your DataFrame. # 3. Correction Suggestion For efficiency and correctness, consider significantly altering the logic of how you generate signals: - **Vectorization:** Instead of applying functions row-by-row, pre-compute the entire series of signals for MACD, Twin Range Filter, and Engulfing patterns. This approach can drastically improve performance. - **Direct Assignment:** Assign signals directly to the DataFrame without using \`apply()\` when possible. - **Trading Logic:** Ensure your strategy's \`next()\` method correctly interprets signals for each time step. # 4. Backtesting Strategy Implementation Your implementation of the \`ChubbStrategy\`'s \`next\` method appears to misunderstand how to use the \`.I()\` method and how signals should govern trades within the \`backtesting.py\` framework. - \`.I()\` method is meant for initializing indicators over the data, not for making dynamic trading decisions in \`next()\`. - In the \`next\` method, you directly compare \`self.signal1\` to integers (1, 2), but \`self.signal1\` is actually a callable object due to the use of \`self.I(lambda: df['signal'])\`. You would need to check the value of the signal at the current step. - Ensure the use of \`self.signal1[-1]\` to check for the latest signal when making buying or selling decisions within \`next\`. This respects the \`backtesting.py\` design where data is accessed as if in real-time, preventing look-ahead bias. # Recommendations To get this code working effectively, you’ll need to: - Revamp your functions for computing indicators and signals so they can operate on the entire DataFrame at once where possible. This might mean rethinking some of your logic to fit a vectorized pattern. - Adapt the strategy pattern correctly within \`backtesting.py\` framework, ensuring proper use of indicators and respecting the temporal nature of trading strategies. Remember, trading strategies and backtesting are complex subjects where details matter a lot. The synergy between financial analysis and technical implementation must be carefully managed."},{"instruction":"how to fix this : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exception Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-25-ea20feb0d7ad> in <cell line: 2>() 1 # df['macd'] = df.apply(lambda x: macd(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) ----> 2 df['trf'] = df.apply(lambda x: twin_range_filter(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 3 df['engulfing'] = df.apply(lambda x: detect_engulfing(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 7 frames /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/talib/__init__.py in wrapper(*args, **kwargs) 33 for k, v in kwargs.items()} 34 ---> 35 result = func(*args, **kwargs) 36 37 # check to see if we got a streaming result talib/_func.pxi in talib._ta_lib.EMA() talib/_func.pxi in talib._ta_lib.check_begidx1() Exception: inputs are all NaN","output":"The error you're encountering indicates that at some point, the input to the TALib function (in this case, likely \`EMA\`) consists entirely of \`NaN\` values. This can happen during your \`twin_range_filter\` function execution, where the input series to \`talib.EMA\` becomes all \`NaN\` for some row(s). This situation can arise due to the way you're slicing and applying your function row-by-row with: \`\`\`python df.apply(lambda x: twin_range_filter(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) \`\`\` At the beginning rows of your DataFrame, there might not be enough data points to calculate the EMA, leading to \`NaN\` outputs, which, when recursively used, result in the error. # How to Fix: 1. **Data Padding:** Ensure that there are enough data points before applying functions that require a minimum number of observations (e.g., moving averages like EMA). TALib functions will return \`NaN\` for the initial period where calculation cannot be performed, which is expected and normal. Usually, you don't apply the function row-by-row but on the whole series directly, which mitigates the issue as the calculation is intended to produce usable values after a warm-up period. 2. **Pre-check for \`NaN\` Values:** Before calling any TALib functions, check if the input series contains only \`NaN\` values. This can be a workaround but might not address the root issue if your calculation logic inherently leads to this scenario often. For instance, insert a condition in your functions to avoid performing TALib operations on entirely \`NaN\` series: \`\`\`python if close.isnull().all(): # handle the case, maybe by continuing to the next iteration or setting a default value continue \`\`\` 3. **Revise the Application Logic:** Instead of applying \`twin_range_filter\` and \`detect_engulfing\` functions row-by-row, consider recalculating these metrics across the entire DataFrame wherever feasible. Vectorized operations, where you calculate indicators for the full series in one go, are not only more efficient but also avoid issues with insufficient data points in initial rows. \`\`\`python # Example: Apply MACD for the entire series macd, signal, hist = talib.MACD(df['close'], fastperiod=12, slowperiod=26, signalperiod=9) df['macd_signal'] = (macd > signal).astype(int) - (macd < signal).astype(int) \`\`\` 4. **Filtering to Avoid Early NaNs:** If using TALib functions early in the series results in \`NaN\` and is problematic, consider starting your analysis after a certain \\"warm-up\\" period where enough data points are available. For instance, if you're calculating a 26-period EMA, start applying other functions or analyzing the data after the first 26 periods. 5. **Debugging Tip:** Isolate and identify exactly where and why the \`NaN\` inputs occur. Simplify and test your function on a small, controlled set of data to see when it fails.

When calculating a 26-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average), you need at least 26 periods of data for the EMA to start producing meaningful values. However, in practice, due to the nature of EMA computation, you might want to allow a slightly longer warm-up period for the calculation to stabilize, especially if you're using the EMA values in further calculations or decisions.

This situation can happen early in the dataset where you might have NaN values in your \`'close'\` price data, or due to the way slicing happens in pandas, particularly with the \`.iloc\` and \`.diff()\` operations that can produce segments of the data with insufficient non-NaN values for the calculation. # Suggested Fixes 1. Ensure Sufficient Non-NaN Data Before Calculation Before running your TA-Lib functions, ensure there are enough data points without NaNs. You can use \`.dropna()\` on your close price series or use a fill method (\`fillna\`) if it makes sense for your analysis (which you've started doing with \`fillna(method='ffill')\`). For financial time series analysis, forward filling might not always be appropriate, so consider the implications on your strategy. 2. Refactor the Application of Your Calculations Instead of attempting to apply the \`twin_range_filter\` function on a row-by-row basis with \`df.apply()\` and possibly encountering segments of your data that don't support meaningful EMA calculation, restructure your approach to compute the indicators and signals for the entire series directly. Adjusting \`smoothrng\` and \`rngfilt\` for Whole Series Calculation Modify the usage of your \`smoothrng\` and \`rngfilt\` functions to work on the entire DataFrame series without slicing into smaller segments that might have insufficient data for TA-Lib to process. Example of Adjusted Approach: Here's an illustrative adjustment focusing on preprocessing and ensuring sufficient non-NaN data before running your main logic, assuming \`df['close']\` has been appropriately preprocessed to minimize NaN issues: \`\`\`python # Ensure df['close'] is filled or cleaned of NaNs appropriately # For demonstration, using forward fill (consider the right approach for your use case) df['close'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True) # Then consider this check before applying TA-Lib functions if df['close'].isnull().any(): raise ValueError(\\"NaN values present in 'close' series.\\") \`\`\` 3. Protective Checks Within Your Function For every call to a TA-Lib function (\`talib.EMA()\`, in your case), ensure the series passed does not solely consist of NaN values. You can introduce a check or default to a placeholder value if NaNs are detected: \`\`\`python def safe_ema(series, timeperiod): \\"\\"\\"A safe wrapper around talib.EMA to handle NaN series.\\"\\"\\" if series.isnull().all(): # Return a series of NaNs of the same length, or consider another fallback return pd.Series(np.nan, index=series.index) else: return talib.EMA(series, timeperiod=timeperiod) \`\`\` Then, use this \`safe_ema\` function within your \`smoothrng\` or directly in calculations to mitigate the exception caused by all-NaN inputs. Final Note: Since these adjustments address the NaN issue at a general level, you still might need to revisit the logic within \`twin_range_filter\` to ensure it correctly applies to your entire series at once or adequately handles edge cases specific to your strategy. Always back-test your strategy after making such adjustments to validate its performance and correctness."},{"instruction":"If worldwide average temperatures dropped to 32°F, how long would it take for oceans to freeze?","output":"If the worldwide average temperature suddenly dropped to 32°F (0°C), the actual freezing of the oceans would not occur overnight, nor would it be uniform or complete due to several important factors: 1. **Depth and Heat Capacity of Oceans**: The oceans are incredibly deep, with an average depth of about 12,080 feet (3,682 meters). This vast body of water has a high heat capacity, meaning it can absorb a lot of heat before its temperature changes significantly. Cooling down the entire volume of the ocean would take a tremendous amount of time. 2. **Salinity**: Ocean water is salty, and salt lowers the freezing point of water. The average salinity of ocean water reduces its freezing point to about -2°C (28.4°F) rather than 0°C (32°F). In some areas, especially where seawater is more saline, this effect would be even more pronounced. 3. **Ocean Currents**: The movement of ocean water plays a crucial role in distributing heat around the planet. Currents such as the Gulf Stream transport warm water from the tropics towards the poles, while colder water is moved towards the equator. These currents would slow the cooling process by constantly moving water around and mixing warmer water with cooler water. Given these factors, even with a drastic and sustained drop in atmospheric temperature to 32°F, the oceans would cool much more slowly than the air. Estimating an exact timeline for the entire ocean to freeze is complex and fraught with uncertainties, largely due to the depth, vast volume, and dynamic nature of the oceans. However, we can confidently say it would take a very long time—on the order of thousands of years—for the oceans to fully freeze solid, if it were even possible under such a scenario. In reality, localized freezing would occur first in the polar regions where sea ice already forms and grows during the winter months, while the deep ocean and areas affected by strong currents would remain unfrozen for a much longer period."},{"instruction":"now, how about 14°F?","output":"At a sustained average global temperature of 14°F (-10°C), the environmental impact would be significantly more severe than at 32°F (0°C), leading to much more extensive ice cover, including a dramatic expansion of polar ice caps and formation of sea ice over large portions of the oceans. However, even at this lower temperature, several factors would still prevent the oceans from freezing solid quickly or entirely: 1. **Depth and Heat Capacity**: The oceans' vast depth and volume mean they have a tremendous capacity to store heat. Cooling the entire depth of the ocean to the point of freezing solid, especially below the thermocline (where temperature declines sharply), would take an incredibly long time due to the thermal inertia of such a large body of water. 2. **Salinity**: Salt content lowers the freezing point of seawater to about -2°C (28.4°F). In regions with higher salinity, this effect would be more pronounced, further resisting freezing. 3. **Ocean Currents**: Ocean currents would continue to distribute heat around the planet, although their patterns could be altered in such a drastically changed climate. Warm water from the equator would still move towards the poles, slowing the freezing process, especially in deeper waters. Assuming the atmosphere could somehow sustain an average temperature of 14°F (-10°C), surface layers of the oceans in polar regions would freeze over more extensively and quickly than at 32°F (0°C). Sea ice would extend much farther towards the equator, and seasonal sea ice in polar regions would become permanent, thickening over time. However, much of the deep ocean, particularly at lower latitudes, would likely remain liquid for centuries or millennia due to the reasons mentioned. Given the current scientific understanding, a complete freeze of the oceanic body, from surface to seabed globally, is practically inconceivable simply due to a drop in air temperature to 14°F (-10°C). The process towards a significantly ice-encrusted planet would be more rapid at such a low temperature compared to 32°F (0°C), but the deep ocean freezing solid would still take a very long time under these conditions—a time likely measured in thousands of years, with the possibility that equilibrium conditions would never allow the deepest parts to freeze solid at all."},{"instruction":"then -4°F?","output":"With an even more extreme scenario where the worldwide average temperature drops to -4°F (-20°C), the circumstances become harder to extrapolate based on existing scientific understanding, primarily because such conditions don't have a precedent in the current geological epoch, and the physics starts to involve complex interactions that are not fully accounted for in models designed for current climate conditions. However, several key points can still help frame what might happen: 1. **Dramatic Expansion of Ice Coverage**: Temperatures of -4°F (-20°C) would lead to an extraordinary expansion of ice cover over the oceans. Sea ice would grow extensively, covering much larger areas of the oceans and likely becoming several meters thick, even in some regions that are currently temperate. 2. **Salinity and Deep Water**: The extreme cold would greatly increase the rate at which surface waters freeze, but the saltiness of ocean water lowers its freezing point. Deeper waters, particularly those that are more saline, would resist freezing due to both the salt content and the vast volume of water that would need to be cooled throughout the depths. 3. **Thermohaline Circulation Slowdown or Halting**: One significant factor in ocean dynamics is the thermohaline circulation, driven by differences in water density, which itself is affected by both temperature and salinity. This global \\"conveyor belt\\" could slow down significantly or even halt under such extreme cold, reducing the distribution of remaining heat in the ocean's depths. This reduction could lead to different freezing rates in different areas but would not necessarily mean the entire ocean would freeze solid rapidly. 4. **Deep Ocean Temperatures**: Despite surface freezing, the profound depths of the ocean would remain insulated by the massive volume of water above them. Given the high specific heat capacity of water, cooling the entire depth to the point of freezing, especially in the deep and mid-oceans, would take an incredibly long time—likely many thousands to tens of thousands of years, if it could occur at all. 5. **Global Climate System Collapse and Reconfiguration**: At such extreme sustained temperatures, Earth's climate system as we know it would collapse and reconfigure into a state that is difficult to predict with accuracy. Life, ecosystems, atmospheric dynamics, and oceanic currents would all be radically altered. In this scenario, while the surface of the oceans and seas closer to the poles would freeze and extend towards the equator, and while some upper levels of the deeper oceans might begin to freeze, the complete freezing of the entire ocean, from surface to the deepest trenches, remains unlikely in any practical timescale. The intense cold would lead to a significantly different planet, with vast ice sheets covering much of the surface land and ocean, but the deep ocean would probably still resist freezing solid due to its volume, depth, and residual geothermal heat from the Earth's core warming the seabed."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

GPT4的路径中，MOE被认为是模型架构侧的关键之关键。因此，观察社区在MOE的整体成熟度，能帮助了解往4走的节奏。例如，23.11开始有零星的MOE开源模型，24.2月开始增多明显，意味着成熟度到达一定阶段（考虑到开源本身有留一手）。 ○ 指标维度 —— 以 MMLU 指标作为观察当前开源大模型能力水位线的快速反应指标。例如，65左右（23.11）属于GPT3.5的水位，77-80左右（23.2）属于准GPT4水位。场景应用预研跟随指标榜趋势进行提前布局。 挑战三：针对“AI+全自动找挑一站式代理流程”（smart-shopping）的实现难点： 1. 大模型如何为用户的需求生成有价值的“购物指导”？ 2. 大模型如何根据“购物指南”找到相关商品？ 3. 大模型如何理解商品并做出最佳推荐？ 行动： ● 采用Qwen-14B根据用户需求描述 结合外搜（夸克搜索 + 自建小红书博文索引）生成“购物指导”，同时为了提升“购物指导”的可信度提升，设计了引用提示来激活大模型指明结论或观点的来源。 ● 采用Qwen-72B根据“购物指南”结合用户需求描述生成多个商品搜索词，通过引导工具调用（主搜）召回相关商品。 ○ 当召回商品过少时，会引导大模型做优化搜索词生成，进行二次召回（ReACT模式） ○ 为了提高这一环节的商品召回率和丰富度，基于 m3e + v-store 对一部分首猜商品搭建了向量化索引 ● 大模型对找到的商品进行分析，分为“粗读”和“细读”两个阶段： ○ 粗读阶段：利用商品标题描述，结合商品搜索词，采用Mistral 8x7B-moe，一次性针对200个左右的商品（7-10个搜索词召回）进行高效可靠的相关性分析，筛选出20个相关商品。 ○ 细读阶段：将商品的CPV信息 + 部分服务信息根据大模型易于理解的格式构造形成商品文档，采用Qwen-72B通过分析商品文档内容，结合用户需求和购物指南，生成3个商品推荐及理由。 成果/效果： 1. 源宝AI采购助手 1.0 / 1.5 / 2.0（目前日活用户 2w+，随放量逐步增加中 #TODO 表述？） 2. smart-shopping（体验原型：https://pre-air.1688.com/kapp/cbu-ai-pilot/ai-shopping-guide/home） 关键事件/结果3：买家询盘体验建设 一句话：聚焦询盘体验核心问题，创新算法+产技运联动构建买家询盘体验保障线。 场景/背景 在B类买家的采购流程中，询盘环节扮演了至关重要的角色。此阶段是买家进行深度评估和选择供应商的关键时期，涵盖对产品和服务细节的探讨。通过询盘，不仅能够精确掌握产品信息和供应商的生产能力，同时也可以评估供应商是否具备良好沟通和服务意识，这对建立合作至关重要。响应率（买家能否及时地获得必需信息）和服务态度（沟通时能否感受到供应商的专业与礼貌）是确保询盘结果正面的两大核心因素，直接影响着买家的交易决策。平台在建立规则制度要求商家提升响应和服务质量同时，也致力于打造智能化产品来保障和提升体验边界。 参与人 ● 晓破、旺旺产技相关、CCO、CRO 我的角色/作用 工作整体目标和任务： 1. 建设买家询盘场景识别能力，同时聚焦提升售前阶段买家咨询的响应体验 2. 建设1688全域询盘消息质量检测能力，支持CCO治理-引导-改善商家询盘服务质量 3. 沉淀从对话理解、知识问答、询盘知识库一整套询盘智能化能力栈，支持询盘体验长期建设 我所承担目标和任务： ● 算法owner ○ 牵头制定（cco、运营、外包）1688站内询盘场景意图树，意图服务及知识问答架构方案设计，协同产技落地智能化响应服务。 ○ 协同产技设计端智能全域询盘消息质量检测方案架构，承担端智能核心算法开发，包括对话情绪识别、对话恶意度识别等。 ○ 抽象标准化1688-询盘算法能力基建，涵盖对话理解、询盘知识库建设、智能问答、对话质量评估等。 事实描述/路径 挑战一：如何在有限的数据标注资源下构造可靠的买家询盘场景识别能力？以及，针对买家售前询盘阶段，如何设计构建一套商家参与的低成本、高时效、高覆盖“知识库方案”来支撑智能问答有效落地？ 行动： ● 协同产技设计实现从数据标注到模型训练迭代一整条SOP流程： ○ 一阶段，通过打通标注平台，结合主动学习和文本匹配技术，提高了数据标注效率和质量，快速完成第一版买家询盘问题语料的构建。 ○ 二阶段，借助预训练技术和数据强化标注，提高识别模型的泛化性。 ○ 三阶段，将识别模型&语料联合迭代，逐步提高。同时为了进一步提高模型准确性，研发了词&标签联合表征网络。 ● 通过走访商家和客服外包小二了解到，相当大一部分售前商品类咨询能从商品详情页的图片中获取信息。而商品详情图的维护对于商家来说，从入驻平台起就是“日常工作”，并不会带来额外的roi负担。然而，一体式的图片问答模型由于缺少有效训练数据落地困难，在对整个过程重新解构后，采取链路化方式处理。协同工程侧，搭建了从商品图下载解码 -> ocr解析 -> ocr内容片段聚合 -> 基于query的ocr文本问点抽取 -> 匹配挂载标准问题 -> 图片问答知识库的数据生产链路，从而将问题转化为标准的 KBQA 问题，成功落地。 挑战二：针对商家辱骂问题，如何在商家消息发出前就能进行检测并进行干预？同时，针对商家消息有多个发送端的实际状况，如何保证端侧的识别能力做到高覆盖和一致性？ 行动： ● 为了能在端上检测出商家回复询盘的情绪状况和恶意性，我和相关工程同学选择尝试了集团内首例端智能对话理解方案。为了尽可能减少APP模型加载的成本，优化实现了LSTM+稀疏自注意力的超轻量对话情绪识别网络，以及textCNN+贝叶斯结合的超轻量对话恶意性检测网络，通过样本测试，两项的检测准确性均达到95%以上。在整个设计-研发-踩坑-上线过程中，作为PM协同相关工程同学和MNN团队做了大量交流和联动，确保了整个检测能力的落地。 ● 通过离线训练小样本分类模型，通过拉取日志大规模打标后进行数据分析发现，商家辱骂消息的来源设备分布主要集中（95+%）在商家版PC、主客IOS和Android。在数据结论的的指导下，协同工程侧构造从模型训练到三端同步更新部署的SOP，识别覆盖率有效保障同时确保能力一致性。 成果/效果 1. 智能响应服务参与响应询盘买家超过 7000w（fy23数据），提升相关商家3分钟响应率25.3%，带动大盘响应提升 6.5pt 2. 商家辱骂情况下降了49.6%（柯南相关求助的数据进行对比），cco体验红榜 3. 魔笛作为涵盖询盘对话理解、多模态问答能力的一整套方案体系，获得克莱蒙特冠军 基于上述工作总结，请结合下一层级人才标准，总结自身的符合情况 #TODO表述？ 价值贡献 1. 在大模型技术栈、源宝AI采购助手和买家询盘体验专项方面取得多项成果，包括技术路线制定、数据沉淀、算法优化、应用落地等。 2. 建设大模型技术栈，包括模型层基础能力、数据层沉淀和应用层探索，有效提升大模型执行任务能力和知识水平。 3. 作为源宝算法owner，制定算法整体方案，承担0-1算法链路开发和核心算法攻坚，并探索“AI+全自动找挑一站式代理流程”新模式。 4. 牵头买家询盘体验专项，建设站内询盘场景识别能力和全域询盘消息质量检测能力，保障商家响应及时和服务质量。 专业素养 1. 对技术体系有深刻理解和前瞻性思考，能结合实际制定技术目标和路线。 2. 具备丰富的技术攻坚和落地经验，掌握先进的技术能力和方法论。 3. 较强的技术研发和系统架构思维，能与跨职能团队紧密合作，推动技术创新和应用。 4. 持续关注技术趋势和前沿进展，有较强的技术学习和创新能力，能探索新技术的应用。 5. 优秀的算法设计和优化能力，能针对具体场景进行算法优化和效果提升。 开放与成长 1. 较强的技术分享和交流能力，能提升团队整体技术共识。 2. 较强的自我驱动和主动学习能力，能快速适应技术和业务变化。 3. 较强的成长意识和自我反思能力，有较强团队合作意识和责任感。","output":"尊敬的评审团成员们，大家好。我是来自艾耕科技的智能对话算法owner，自2018年7月入职以来，经历了从接触工业级NLP到专注智能对话算法的全过程。我的履历横跨艾耕科技至1688，以技术专业性、业务扎实度以及思考和视野的广度为标志。 聚焦到我的关键事件中，从事询盘算法开发到打造1688大模型技术栈再到源宝AI采购助手的构建，我始终把握新技术驱动业务前行的理念。在大模型和AI领域，我深刻认识到技术是推动业务创新的核心力量。我运用大模型技术栈重新定义B类电商领域的智能代理能力，并通过实践和落地证明了技术对于提升1688买家询盘体验和商家接待效率的重要性。 总结过去的工作，我认为自己在技术、业务和团队协作方面都有突出的表现，尤其是在大模型技术的探索和应用上取得了明显的成果，对1688和行业都产生了深远的影响。 展望未来，在AI时代背景下，我认识到技术思考、趋势把握、产品可能性以及业务洞察的重要性。我计划持续深耕大模型和AI领域，通过技术创新驱动产品升级，为公司赋能。同时，我也看到在AI技术快速发展的情况下，如何实现技术的伦理和可持续性是一个值得探索的方向。 总体而言，我期望能够持续推动公司在AI技术和应用方面的创新，引领业务向更深、更广的方向发展，实现价值的最大化。谢谢大家。"},{"instruction":"我要根据以下内容，写一份极优秀流畅的晋升答辩稿（作为现场答辩使用），要求： 1. 整体字数控制在300-400字，能在3-5分钟内流畅地讲完 2. 内容分三个大块： a. 个人履历（重点在1688工作期间，突出强调技术专业性、业务扎实度、思考和视野广度）// 我只会讲20秒 b. 关键事件（能将三件事情串接起来，起手和重点必须是大模型和AI，突出强调在新技术到来时的把握、思考（立足1688）、实践和落地能力，询盘那块以“在我做大模型之前，致力于1688买家询盘体验和商家接待效率....”简要但深刻体现价值贡献地带过 // 我要讲2分钟 c. 在最后总结简要 // 我只会讲 15秒 d. 以及展望未来，AI时代（技术思考、趋势把握、产品可能性、业务洞察）// 我会讲1分钟来拉起大家对未来的期待和预期 P1 个人履历 艾耕科技-智能对话算法owner 技术素养锤炼：接触工业NLP到专注智能对话，多个环节，完整实践智能对话系统从模块到商业交付的0-1 起始时间：2018.07 -

选模型 - 生成预览 - 生成拆解评测 的标准化流程 ● 独立探索“AI全自动化分析模式”，协助工程制定0-1采购助手链路流程架构 ● 持续关注把握Agent方法模式进展，同时向产品侧持续输出建议和思路 事实描述/路径： 挑战一：在模型层，如何激活大模型的任务解决能力、如何调整大模型生成的偏好，以及对大模型生成的结果是否能有效地进行评测？ 行动： ● 激活大模型的任务解决能力是我和团队相关同学最早开始探索的大模型基础能力项目，包括了： ○ 实践了通用任务（e.g. 摘要、情感分析、文案撰写、知识问答等）的指令遵循能力微调 ○ 设计并优化了针对对话型任务的指令微调模式（dialogueBlue-V1/V2） ○ 探索并实现了针对插件工具使用的指令微调模式（plugin） ○ 设计并实现了针对任务分解的计划指令微调模式（plan） ● 为了进一步校正大模型的生成内容，我和团队相关同学在初期便投入了对大模型的偏好对齐训练，包括了： ○ 摸索并走通了RLHF + PPO的强化学习对齐优化方案 ○ 实践了基于DPO的直接偏好优化模式 ○ 作为偏好对齐的基础，整理沉淀了10w+高质量奖励信号数据 ● 评测大模型的生成效果在大模型应用化阶段是一个重要的基础能力。但在能力摸索期（23.3 - 23.9）阶段，相关工作寥寥无几。我和团队实习生对仅有的少量工作调研后发现，大多数依赖GPT4完成，然而这种方式对应用数据存在数据安全隐患。为此，我们提出了集团首个完全经由训练得到“评测大模型”的技术方案，不仅在多个常用任务上验证了方案的有效性，也将该创新工作撰写了论文。 以上实践在过程中进行了SOP化沉淀，形成了 Butterfly 标准化开发框架。 挑战二：在数据层，如何有效地构造任务指令数据来提升大模型解决任务的丰富性，同时往应用侧走的过程中如何提高大模型的知识？ 行动： ● 在能力摸索期（23.3 - 23.9）阶段，更关注如何让大模型有效地执行任务，此时任务指令数据对大模型的性能表现举足轻重。我和相关团队同学从多点着力进行了实践和沉淀： ○ 【指令丰富度】整理沉淀了70.2w涵盖30+通用任务的指令数据集，同时根据前期试验应用场景梳理了9项1688域内任务并通过“自指令技术”自动生成了9.9k的指令数据集。 ○ 【指令质量】设计并逐步优化了采用信息完整度、问题答案匹配度、信息流畅度等一系列模型+规则指标打分的方式，来筛选高质量指令。 ○ 【指令复杂度】借鉴对话微调的思路，设计并有化了混合上下文指令，验证了效果提升。 ● 逐步走向应用阶段（23.10 - 至今）后，大模型自带的知识不是可靠的生成内容来源，并进一步诱发幻觉现象。此时，我和团队相关同学的关注点调整到如何让大模型会用且有可用的外部知识： ○ 基于RAG的方案模式，设计实现了针对多种电商知识型任务（e.g. 商品卖点、商品对比、商品推荐文案、商品口碑分析）的知识引导模版，来使大模型能有效地利用站内商品知识进行任务分析和结果生成。 ○ 针对多种电商知识任务的数据：一方面，协同AI采购助手项目组产技，对数据格式做了规范定义，来改善大模型对知识理解的效率；另一方面，针对带数字的知识（e.g. 百分比、率），为了减少数据幻觉，也做了的格式改写调整优化。 以上实践除了数资沉淀外，过程中的方法论（e.g. 自指令生成、指令打分）也有对应的流程化沉淀。 挑战三：在应用层，如何有效地选择合适的大模型兼顾性能和效果预期、如何让大模型更有效地运用外部知识以及在落地时如何权衡各类Agent的方法模式？ 行动： ● 结合应用侧的实际需求，主要关注大模型在两个维度上的效果：1. 对用户问题理解的准确性；2. 场景任务的生成结果。为了能高效地从各类不同尺寸开源大模型中筛选出符合需求的目标： ○ 【问题理解测试】构建了一个涵盖10+任务场景总计500+问题集，并适配涵盖主流开源模型的系统模版指令引导，设计实现了自动化评测不同尺寸、不同类型在问题理解上的效果。 ○ 【场景任务执行测试】构建了一个涵盖3+场景任务总计100+上下文指令集，适配涵盖主流开源模型的系统模版指令引导同时，采用GPT4构造了多个评测维度的引导模版，设计实现了自动化评测不同任务的结果生成效果。 ● 关于让大模型更有效地运用外部知识，除了前面“数据层”提到的知识数据格式、引导模版等手段外，也设计并实现大模型“自检验”生成的结果，并根据检验的反馈来优化或限制大模型生成。 ● 综合参考了目前主流的Agent方法模式，并根据实际场景做了必要的取舍和更改来聚焦到0-1确定性走通的目标上： ○ 由于目前没有“持续推理”的多段式分解任务诉求，舍弃了ReAct模式 ○ 对插件式调用进行解构，聚焦到外部工具访问和工具参数提取上 ○ 设计并协同工程实现了应用算子结构，来支持“用户问题理解” 和 “场景任务执行” 成果/效果： 1. 模型层基础能力 a. 训练流程化（支持对话、规划、工具、插件等多种类型，rlhf/dpo主流偏好对齐流程） b.

GPT4的路径中，MOE被认为是模型架构侧的关键之关键。因此，观察社区在MOE的整体成熟度，能帮助了解往4走的节奏。例如，23.11开始有零星的MOE开源模型，24.2月开始增多明显，意味着成熟度到达一定阶段（考虑到开源本身有留一手）。 ○ 指标维度 —— 以 MMLU 指标作为观察当前开源大模型能力水位线的快速反应指标。例如，65左右（23.11）属于GPT3.5的水位，77-80左右（23.2）属于准GPT4水位。场景应用预研跟随指标榜趋势进行提前布局。 挑战三：针对“AI+全自动找挑一站式代理流程”（smart-shopping）的实现难点： 1. 大模型如何为用户的需求生成有价值的“购物指导”？ 2. 大模型如何根据“购物指南”找到相关商品？ 3. 大模型如何理解商品并做出最佳推荐？ 行动： ● 采用Qwen-14B根据用户需求描述 结合外搜（夸克搜索 + 自建小红书博文索引）生成“购物指导”，同时为了提升“购物指导”的可信度提升，设计了引用提示来激活大模型指明结论或观点的来源。 ● 采用Qwen-72B根据“购物指南”结合用户需求描述生成多个商品搜索词，通过引导工具调用（主搜）召回相关商品。 ○ 当召回商品过少时，会引导大模型做优化搜索词生成，进行二次召回（ReACT模式） ○ 为了提高这一环节的商品召回率和丰富度，基于 m3e + v-store 对一部分首猜商品搭建了向量化索引 ● 大模型对找到的商品进行分析，分为“粗读”和“细读”两个阶段： ○ 粗读阶段：利用商品标题描述，结合商品搜索词，采用Mistral 8x7B-moe，一次性针对200个左右的商品（7-10个搜索词召回）进行高效可靠的相关性分析，筛选出20个相关商品。 ○ 细读阶段：将商品的CPV信息 + 部分服务信息根据大模型易于理解的格式构造形成商品文档，采用Qwen-72B通过分析商品文档内容，结合用户需求和购物指南，生成3个商品推荐及理由。 成果/效果： 1. 源宝AI采购助手 1.0 / 1.5 / 2.0（目前日活用户 2w+，随放量逐步增加中 #TODO 表述？） 2. smart-shopping（体验原型：https://pre-air.1688.com/kapp/cbu-ai-pilot/ai-shopping-guide/home） 关键事件/结果3：买家询盘体验建设 一句话：聚焦询盘体验核心问题，创新算法+产技运联动构建买家询盘体验保障线。 场景/背景 在B类买家的采购流程中，询盘环节扮演了至关重要的角色。此阶段是买家进行深度评估和选择供应商的关键时期，涵盖对产品和服务细节的探讨。通过询盘，不仅能够精确掌握产品信息和供应商的生产能力，同时也可以评估供应商是否具备良好沟通和服务意识，这对建立合作至关重要。响应率（买家能否及时地获得必需信息）和服务态度（沟通时能否感受到供应商的专业与礼貌）是确保询盘结果正面的两大核心因素，直接影响着买家的交易决策。平台在建立规则制度要求商家提升响应和服务质量同时，也致力于打造智能化产品来保障和提升体验边界。 参与人 ● 晓破、旺旺产技相关、CCO、CRO 我的角色/作用 工作整体目标和任务： 1. 建设买家询盘场景识别能力，同时聚焦提升售前阶段买家咨询的响应体验 2. 建设1688全域询盘消息质量检测能力，支持CCO治理-引导-改善商家询盘服务质量 3. 沉淀从对话理解、知识问答、询盘知识库一整套询盘智能化能力栈，支持询盘体验长期建设 我所承担目标和任务： ● 算法owner ○ 牵头制定（cco、运营、外包）1688站内询盘场景意图树，意图服务及知识问答架构方案设计，协同产技落地智能化响应服务。 ○ 协同产技设计端智能全域询盘消息质量检测方案架构，承担端智能核心算法开发，包括对话情绪识别、对话恶意度识别等。 ○ 抽象标准化1688-询盘算法能力基建，涵盖对话理解、询盘知识库建设、智能问答、对话质量评估等。 事实描述/路径 挑战一：如何在有限的数据标注资源下构造可靠的买家询盘场景识别能力？以及，针对买家售前询盘阶段，如何设计构建一套商家参与的低成本、高时效、高覆盖“知识库方案”来支撑智能问答有效落地？ 行动： ● 协同产技设计实现从数据标注到模型训练迭代一整条SOP流程： ○ 一阶段，通过打通标注平台，结合主动学习和文本匹配技术，提高了数据标注效率和质量，快速完成第一版买家询盘问题语料的构建。 ○ 二阶段，借助预训练技术和数据强化标注，提高识别模型的泛化性。 ○ 三阶段，将识别模型&语料联合迭代，逐步提高。同时为了进一步提高模型准确性，研发了词&标签联合表征网络。 ● 通过走访商家和客服外包小二了解到，相当大一部分售前商品类咨询能从商品详情页的图片中获取信息。而商品详情图的维护对于商家来说，从入驻平台起就是“日常工作”，并不会带来额外的roi负担。然而，一体式的图片问答模型由于缺少有效训练数据落地困难，在对整个过程重新解构后，采取链路化方式处理。协同工程侧，搭建了从商品图下载解码 -> ocr解析 -> ocr内容片段聚合 -> 基于query的ocr文本问点抽取 -> 匹配挂载标准问题 -> 图片问答知识库的数据生产链路，从而将问题转化为标准的 KBQA 问题，成功落地。 挑战二：针对商家辱骂问题，如何在商家消息发出前就能进行检测并进行干预？同时，针对商家消息有多个发送端的实际状况，如何保证端侧的识别能力做到高覆盖和一致性？ 行动： ● 为了能在端上检测出商家回复询盘的情绪状况和恶意性，我和相关工程同学选择尝试了集团内首例端智能对话理解方案。为了尽可能减少APP模型加载的成本，优化实现了LSTM+稀疏自注意力的超轻量对话情绪识别网络，以及textCNN+贝叶斯结合的超轻量对话恶意性检测网络，通过样本测试，两项的检测准确性均达到95%以上。在整个设计-研发-踩坑-上线过程中，作为PM协同相关工程同学和MNN团队做了大量交流和联动，确保了整个检测能力的落地。 ● 通过离线训练小样本分类模型，通过拉取日志大规模打标后进行数据分析发现，商家辱骂消息的来源设备分布主要集中（95+%）在商家版PC、主客IOS和Android。在数据结论的的指导下，协同工程侧构造从模型训练到三端同步更新部署的SOP，识别覆盖率有效保障同时确保能力一致性。 成果/效果 1. 智能响应服务参与响应询盘买家超过 7000w（fy23数据），提升相关商家3分钟响应率25.3%，带动大盘响应提升 6.5pt 2. 商家辱骂情况下降了49.6%（柯南相关求助的数据进行对比），cco体验红榜 3. 魔笛作为涵盖询盘对话理解、多模态问答能力的一整套方案体系，获得克莱蒙特冠军 基于上述工作总结，请结合下一层级人才标准，总结自身的符合情况 #TODO表述？ 价值贡献 1. 在大模型技术栈、源宝AI采购助手和买家询盘体验专项方面取得多项成果，包括技术路线制定、数据沉淀、算法优化、应用落地等。 2. 建设大模型技术栈，包括模型层基础能力、数据层沉淀和应用层探索，有效提升大模型执行任务能力和知识水平。 3. 作为源宝算法owner，制定算法整体方案，承担0-1算法链路开发和核心算法攻坚，并探索“AI+全自动找挑一站式代理流程”新模式。 4. 牵头买家询盘体验专项，建设站内询盘场景识别能力和全域询盘消息质量检测能力，保障商家响应及时和服务质量。 专业素养 1. 对技术体系有深刻理解和前瞻性思考，能结合实际制定技术目标和路线。 2. 具备丰富的技术攻坚和落地经验，掌握先进的技术能力和方法论。 3. 较强的技术研发和系统架构思维，能与跨职能团队紧密合作，推动技术创新和应用。 4. 持续关注技术趋势和前沿进展，有较强的技术学习和创新能力，能探索新技术的应用。 5. 优秀的算法设计和优化能力，能针对具体场景进行算法优化和效果提升。 开放与成长 1. 较强的技术分享和交流能力，能提升团队整体技术共识。 2. 较强的自我驱动和主动学习能力，能快速适应技术和业务变化。 3. 较强的成长意识和自我反思能力，有较强团队合作意识和责任感。","output":"尊敬的评委，大家好，我是来自1688团队的候选人。今天，我有幸站在这里，向各位展示过去几年里我在AI技术领域的探索和成就，以及我对未来技术发展的思考和展望。 首先，让我简要回顾一下我的个人履历。在加入1688之前，我在艾耕科技担任智能对话算法的负责人，负责研发工业级智能对话系统和汽车知识图谱向量化表达技术。这段经历为我后来在1688团队深入研究询盘算法和大模型技术奠定了坚实的基础。 进入1688后，我作为询盘算法和大模型技术的负责人，带领团队在三个关键领域取得了显著成果。一是对B类电商特有的大模型技术栈进行构建，实现数据、模型和应用层面的突破。其中，在大模型技术上，我们围绕数据微调、模型对齐进行深入研究，提升了AI技术在电商场景中的应用效果。二是开发了源宝AI采购助手，有效促进了“挑品”环节的效率，探索AI与B2B电商的结合新模式。三是在买家询盘体验上，通过算法与产技的深度合作，大幅提升了买家的咨询响应率和体验质量。 展望未来，AI技术的发展将进一步改变B2B电商平台的运行模式。我认为，随着AI技术的成熟，数据驱动和模型优化将持续推动电商平台向更加智能化、个性化的方向发展。同时，AI技术将在优化供应链、提升交易效率、精准匹配买卖双方等方面发挥更大作用。我期待在接下来的工作中，能够持续探索AI技术与B2B电商结合的更多可能性，为企业提供更加智能化的服务，推动企业数字化转型，为1688乃至整个行业的发展做出更多贡献。 谢谢各位的倾听。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, according to Aptheker (1960, 34), Mills was simply blind to the “intensification of the domination of the sinews of capitalism by the banking collosi and to the mounting merger movement among the banks themselves.” Hence, Mills had missed a key factor of class cohesion within the economic elite. In contrast, Aptheker (1960, 35) argues that finance capital “is the apex of power today in the United States, and its absence from Mills’ Power Elite seriously hurts the book’s validity from the viewpoint of sheer description as well as basic definition” (Cf., Zeitlin, 1977, Chaps. 1–5; 1980, Chaps. 2–4). For Aptheker, there were several additional problems that emanated from this theoretical and empirical lacuna. The orthodox Marxist-Leninist analysis saw finance capital as the engine of a new “epoch of imperialism” (Perlo, 1957), which was defined primarily by the internationalization of American capital (Aptheker, 1960, 36). In other words, the power elite was no longer simply an “American” power elite, but one with interests, connections, and structural limitations related to its export of capital. Aptheker contends that Mills’ failure to analyze the economic underpinnings of imperial expansion seriously weakened his ability to understand the “military ascendancy” of the warlords or to grasp the structural and institutional basis of the power elite’s foreign policy. Instead, Mills tended to present the power elite’s new foreign adventures as a cynical form of Beardian “diversion” to entertain and distract the masses, rather than part of the process of capitalist development (see Barrow, 1997). Whether one shared a Marxist viewpoint or not, the importance of this theoretical linkage was that it allowed Aptheker to elaborate the political, as opposed to the methodological, significance of Sweezy’s complaint about Mills’ “historical voluntarism.” Aptheker (1960, 19) also chastised Mills for depicting “the power elite as, in fact, and despite some qualification, all-powerful” and thus depicting the masses of people as generally powerless. Aptheker was concerned that Mills had constructed an exaggerated image of the power elite’s omnipotence, precisely because he does not incorporate “class” and “class conflict” into his theoretical apparatus. In some ways, Mills reproduces the power elite’s own worst delusions about the magnitude of its power, while simultaneously undercutting those delusions with satirical observations about its incompetence and mediocrity. However, Aptheker does not merely offer up the concept of “class conflict” as an ideological epithet for dismissing Mills. He elaborates how an empirical and historical analysis of class conflict would have allowed Mills to see the limitations and contradictions of power in the higher circles. Aptheker (1960, 24–25) argues that: between the will of that elite and its capabilities of implementing that will stands public opinion, including American public opinion. This public opinion is not simply shaped by the elite, and this public opinion does affect what the elite tries to do and what it does and how it does what it does. Moreover, in whole areas of life—as in wages and working conditions, housing and education, the battle against Jim Crow and against war—the desires and power of the masses do exert great influence, manifested in buses that stop running and in atomic bombs that, though loaded aboard planes that are alerted to take off, never are dropped in war. Aptheker was theoretically more attuned to the subterranean movements within American society that at the time were invisible to Mills. Even in 1956, there was a small anti-nuclear movement and a peace movement. There was a burgeoning civil rights movement that was expanding into a poor peoples’ movement. There were still progressives, and even socialists and communists, in American trade unions. In sum, it was Aptheker’s (1960, 20) contention that Mills had overstated the success of “the elite’s effort to make all Americans morally as corrupt as the elite themselves.” There were poor people, African-Americans, and ordinary middle-class Americans who struggled day-to-day to make a living and who did not share the power elite’s war-mongering ways or its self-absorption with conspicuous consumption. In this sense, Mills’ conception of a power elite dominating “the masses” obscured the fact that there were not just very rich people in America, but poor and very poor people in America (Aptheker, 1960, 12). It was not enough to challenge Louis Hartz’s (1955) America as a middle-class thesis by demonstrating the existence of “the very rich,” because this critique still ignored the fact that the United States had an underclass of the poor and very poor and that much of this underclass was racialized and gendered (Harrington, 1962). Moreover, Aptheker’s theoretical lens also made him far more attentive to the liberation struggles in what was then called the “Third World.” Here, too, Aptheker (1960, 27) argues that Mills’ inability to recognize the significance of the internationalization of capital as the economic basis of American foreign policy meant that Mills could not see that American public opinion was important, but also that world public opinion, splits among the imperialist partners, and divisions in the opinions of the American elite were also potent forces in constraining the power elite. These factors had all played a role in staying the hand of Mills’ “Military Ascendancy.” In sum, the main point for Aptheker (1960, 29) was “that the elite are by no means omnipotent, and the masses of people in our country are neither powerless nor apathetic.” Finally, Aptheker suggests that the absence of a theory of capitalist development in Mills’ work generates an additional blind spot concerning the role of the U.S. South in American political and economic development. Aptheker’s contention was that race and neo-conservatism had a deeper basis in historical class development than Mills recognized in his analysis of the 1950s “conservative mood.” Aptheker (1960, 11) suggests that Mills would have arrived at different conclusions had he recognized that “there was a relative, not absolute, absence of feudal forms and institutions here—they were, for example, important in upstate New York and in Maryland—and that there was a prefeudal form in our history, chattel slavery, which played a decisive role in American development through the Civil War, just as some of its survivals exert so decisive an influence upon present-day American life.” This was not just a historical quibble, but an omission with profound theoretical implications. First, this lacuna in Mills’ analysis creates a blind spot to the question of race in America. Aptheker (1960, 11–12) laments “Mills’ consistent ignoring of the Negro question in all his writings.” Hence, he misses what was already becoming an important structural base for progressive political action in the United States. Second, this lacuna also leads Mills to ignore the structural basis of traditional conservatism in America—strongly located in the South, but extended more generally throughout the rural and suburban hinterlands of white America. Aptheker observes presciently that what Mills dismissed as a short-term “conservative mood” actually had a deep historical basis in the American social structure—one that was tied historically to race and region—and that would not abate with a changing political mood. Thus, while Mills states that “there can be no conservative ideology of the classic type” in America, Aptheker (1960, 16) identifies this claim as a significant error “stemming from Mills’ complete ignoring of Southern life and history and the realities of a kind of industrial feudalism in U.S. development.” Indeed, this is a serious omission for a sociologist of knowledge so deeply influenced by Karl Mannheim. Finally, Aptheker (1960, 14 fn.) criticizes Mills generally for failing to cite “American Marxist writers, though their work anticipates and expands much of his own.” Despite Mills’ “bare and very brief allusions” to Marx and Marxism in The Power Elite, Aptheker (1960, 15) was hopeful that “perhaps in a future work Mills will yet face up fully to the challenge of Marxism by testing its propositions against American reality as he sees it today.” In this respect, a significant feature of Aptheker’s critique is a genuine effort to engage Mills theoretically based on a discussion of empirical and historical facts—whether by reinterpretation or omission—rather than through conceptual one-upmanship based on ideological prescriptions or party doctrine. One simply does not find the types of ideological epithets—“distorted Marxism,” “semi-Marxism,” or “would-be Marxism”—that became so common in the Poulantzas-Miliband debate and its aftermath in the 1970s. Sweezy’s and Aptheker’s criticisms are meant to build on and extend Mills’ work, rather than dismiss it as part of some sterile abstract jargon-laded polemic. ”翻译为中文","output":"阿普泰克认为，“金融资本”概念作为资本主义经济的组织原则，并非固有的“马克思主义”，米尔斯还有其他更加民粹或甚至是经验性的路径通往该概念。然而，根据阿普泰克（1960，34）的观点，米尔斯对银行巨头对资本主义命脉的统治加剧以及银行自身合并运动的上升趋势视而不见。因此，米尔斯错过了经济精英阶层内部阶级凝聚的一个关键因素。相反，阿普泰克（1960，35）认为，金融资本“是今天美国权力的顶点，其缺席严重削弱了米尔斯的《权力精英》一书的有效性，无论是从纯粹描述还是基本定义的角度而言”（参见Zeitlin，1977，第1-5章；1980，第2-4章）。 对阿普泰克来说，这一理论和经验上的空白还衍生了几个额外的问题。正统的马克思列宁主义分析视金融资本为新“帝国主义时代”的引擎（Perlo, 1957），这主要是由美国资本的国际化所定义。换句话说，权力精英不再仅仅是一个“美国”的权力精英，而是一个与其资本输出相关的利益、联系和结构限制的权力精英。阿普泰克认为，米尔斯未能分析帝国扩张的经济基础，严重削弱了他理解“军事霸权”上升的能力，或是把握权力精英外交政策的结构和制度基础。相反，米尔斯倾向于将权力精英的新外国冒险描绘为一种贝尔德式的“消遣”，用以娱乐和分散大众的注意力，而非作为资本主义发展过程的一部分（参见Barrow，1997）。无论是否持有马克思主义观点，这一理论联系的重要性在于，它使阿普泰克能够论述斯威齐对米尔斯“历史自愿主义”抱怨的政治意义，而非仅仅是方法论上的。 阿普泰克（1960，19）还批评米尔斯将“权力精英描述为，实际上，尽管有一些限定，但全能的”，从而将大众描绘为普遍无力的。阿普泰克担心米尔斯构建了一个夸大的权力精英全能形象，正是因为他没有将“阶级”和“阶级冲突”纳入他的理论框架。在某些方面，米尔斯重现了权力精英对自己力量大小的最糟糕妄想，同时又用讽刺的观察削弱了这些妄想，这些观察强调了他们的无能和平庸。然而，阿普泰克并不是仅仅提出“阶级冲突”概念作为一种排斥米尔斯的意识形态口号。他阐述了一个关于阶级冲突的经验性和历史分析是如何能够让米尔斯看到高层权力中的局限性和矛盾。 阿普泰克（1960，24-25）认为： 那个精英的意愿与其实施意愿的能力之间存在公众舆论，包括美国公众舆论。这种公众舆论不仅仅是由精英塑造的，而且这种公众舆论确实影响了精英试图做什么、他们做了什么以及他们如何做他们所做的事情。此外，在生活的整个领域——如在工资和工作条件、住房和教育、对抗吉姆·克劳法和对抗战争——大众的愿望和力量确实施加了巨大影响，这在停运的公交车和装载在警报状态下准备起飞的飞机上的原子弹，从未在战争中被投下时得到体现。 阿普泰克在理论上更加关注美国社会内部当时对米尔斯不可见的地下运动。即使在1956年，也有一个小型的反核运动和和平运动。有一个正在扩大的民权运动，正在发展成一个穷人运动。在美国的工会中仍然有进步分子，甚至还有社会主义者和共产主义者。总而言之，阿普泰克（1960，20）的观点是，米尔斯高估了“精英努力使所有美国人在道德上和精英自身一样腐化”的成功。有穷人、非裔美国人和普通的中产阶级美国人，他们日复一日地努力谋生，他们并不分享权力精英的好战方式或其自我沉醉于显赫消费的方式。从这个意义上说，米尔斯对一个统治“大众”的权力精英的构想掩盖了一个事实，那就是美国不仅仅有非常富有的人，还有穷人和非常穷的人（阿普泰克，1960，12）。仅仅挑战路易斯·哈兹（Louis Hartz, 1955）的美国作为一个中产阶级论题是不够的，因为这一批判仍然忽略了一个事实，那就是美国有一个穷人和非常穷的人的底层，而且这个底层在很大程度上是种族化和性别化的（哈灵顿，1962）。 此外，阿普泰克的理论视角还使他更加关注所谓“第三世界”的解放斗争。在这里，阿普泰克（1960，27）也认为，米尔斯未能认识到资本国际化作为美国外交政策经济基础的重要性意味着米尔斯无法看到美国公众舆论很重要，但世界公众舆论、帝国主义伙伴之间的分裂，以及美国精英观点中的分歧也是限制权力精英的有力因素。这些因素都在米尔斯的“军事霸权”的手上发挥了作用。总之，对阿普泰克（1960，29）来说，“精英绝不是全能的，而我们国家的大众既不是无助的，也不是冷漠的。” 最后，阿普泰克认为米尔斯作品中缺乏对资本主义发展的理论，这产生了一个关于美国南部在美国政治和经济发展中角色的额外盲点。阿普泰克的观点是，种族和新保守主义在历史阶级发展中有一个更深层次的基础，而米尔斯对1950年代“保守情绪”的分析并未认识到这一点。阿普泰克（1960，11）认为，如果米尔斯认识到“这里存在着封建形式和制度的相对缺乏，而不是绝对缺乏——例如，它们在纽约上州和马里兰州很重要——而且有一种前封建形式在我们历史中起着决定性作用的奴隶制，它在美国发展中直至内战，就像它的一些遗留影响至今对当代美国生活产生着如此决定性的影响。”这不仅仅是一个历史学上的争论，而是一个具有深远理论意义的遗漏。 首先，米尔斯分析中的这一空白创造了对美国种族问题的盲点。阿普泰克（1960，11-12）遗憾“米尔斯在他所有的著作中一贯忽视了黑人问题。”因此，他错过了已经成为美国进步政治行动重要结构基础的东西。其次，这一空白还导致米尔斯忽视了美国传统保守主义的结构基础——主要位于南部，但更普遍地延伸到美国白人的农村和郊区腹地。阿普泰克预见性地观察到，米尔斯把短期的“保守情绪”视为无关紧要，实际上这种情绪在美国社会结构中有一个深刻的历史基础——一个与种族和地区历史上紧密相关的基础，并且这种基础不会随着政治情绪的改变而减弱。因此，虽然米尔斯声称“在美国不可能有经典类型的保守主义意识形态”，阿普泰克（1960，16）认为这是一个重大错误，“这起源于米尔斯对南部生活和历史以及美国发展中一种工业封建主义现实的完全忽视。”确实，对于一个如此深受卡尔·曼海姆影响的知识社会学家来说，这是一个严重的遗漏。 最后，阿普泰克（1960，14注）普遍批评米尔斯没有引用“美国马克思主义作家的作品，尽管他们的工作预见并扩展了他的许多观点。”尽管米尔斯在《权力精英》中对马克思和马克思主义“简单而非常简短的提及”，阿普泰克（1960，15）仍然希望“也许在未来的作品中米尔斯会完全面对马克思主义的挑战，通过测试其命题与他今天所看到的美国现实的符合程度。”在这方面，阿普泰克批判的一个重要特点是，他基于对经验和历史事实的讨论（无论是通过重新解释还是遗漏）而非基于意识形态处方或党派教条的概念对抗，真诚地从理论上与米尔斯进行了接触。在1970年代Poulantzas-Miliband辩论及其后果中变得如此普遍的那种意识形态标签——“扭曲的马克思主义”、“半马克思主义”或“假马克思主义”——在这里根本找不到。斯威齐和阿普泰克的批评旨在基于和扩展米尔斯的工作，而不是将其作为某种毫无生气的抽象术语争论来驳斥。"},{"instruction":"请将“What Is Marxism? The result of the encounter between C. Wright Mills and Anglo-American Marxists was that real theoretical progress occurred over the next decade as an intellectual “New Left” emerged in the discursive space between liberal-social democratic pragmatism and Communist orthodoxy (Jamison and Eyerman, 1994). Mills did not immediately accept the theoretical implications of Marxist criticism, but it did lead him to reevaluate Marx and Marxism as is evident in his last book The Marxists (1962). Mills’ rejoinder to the Marxists was interesting not so much because he disavowed being a Marxist, but because he raised the issue that would loom large in the state debate of the 1970s: What is a “Marxist”? Mills identified three intellectual types of Marxism: Vulgar Marxism, Sophisticated Marxism, and Plain Marxism. Mills (1962, 96) had little to say about Vulgar Marxism,14 but he observed that Sophisticated Marxists: … are mainly concerned with marxism as a model of society and with the theories developed with the aid of this model. Empirical exceptions to theories are relegated to subsidiary importance: new theories are made up to account for these exceptions in such a way as to avoid revision of the general model. These theories are then read back into the texts of Marx. … But there comes a time when the supplementary hypotheses become so bulky, the deviant facts so overwhelming, that the whole theory or even model becomes clumsy. At that point marxism becomes “sophisticated” in a useless and obscurantist sense.15 Mills’ definition of Sophisticated Marxism is somewhat ambiguous, but he appears to suggest that Marx constructed a “model” of capitalist society that can generate different political theories at various times and in different capitalist geographies to account for both new developments and specific conjunctures in particular capitalist societies.16 He also suggests that Sophisticated Marxists, because of their political commitment to an official party line, or a particular type of political action, often make the mistake of reducing Marx’s model of capitalism to historically specific theories that are ensconced in party doctrine or that justify preconceived courses of political action. Thus, for Mills, Sophisticated Marxism was typically constrained in its theorizing by an official party line,17 and in contrast to Plain Marxists, were unable to make the necessary theoretical adjustments required by changing times and circumstances. Since Mills never belonged to any political party—indeed, he probably never even voted—it was the Plain Marxists that were more interesting to Mills. Mills defined a Plain Marxist as someone who works “in Marx’s own tradition,” whether in agreement or disagreement with him. A Plain Marxist is someone who understands: Marx, and many later marxists as well, to be firmly a part of the classic tradition of sociological thinking. They treat Marx like any great nineteenth century figure, in a scholarly way; they treat each later phase of marxism as historically specific. They are generally agreed … that his general model and his ways of thinking are central to their own intellectual history and remain relevant to their attempts to grasp present-day social worlds. (Mills, 1962, 96) Mills includes a highly eclectic group within this intellectual type, including Joan Robinson, Isaac Deutscher, William Morris, Antonio Gramsci, Rosa Luxemburg, G.D.H. Cole, Georg Lukacs, Christopher Cauldwell, Jean-Paul Sartre, John Strachey, George Sorel, E.P. Thompson, Leszek Kolakowski, William A. Williams, Paul Sweezy, and Erich Fromm. One might conclude, given Mills’ earlier reply to Lekachman, that if he did not include himself in this group, he was at least hovering around its edges. Who knows where this ongoing engagement might have led if not for Mills’ untimely death at the age of forty-five? Indeed, Irving Howe (1963), one of Mills’ former friends, observes that while “Mills was not a convert to Communism,” he was turning toward the type of Plain Marxism “which in America is expressed by Paul Sweezy’s Monthly Review” (Horowitz, 1983; Cf. Miliband, 1964; Zeitlin, 1989, 47).18 Indeed, after publishing The Power Elite, Mills began moving in Marxist intellectual circles. In 1957, he traveled outside the United States for the first time in his life, where he visited the London School of Economics and met Ralph Miliband (Miliband, 1962, 18). Subsequently, Mills traveled to Poland, where he met Adam Schaff and Lezek Kolakowski. He made two trips to the Soviet Union in 1960 and 1961 and visited Cuba in 1960 to gather materials for his book Listen Yanqui! According to Miliband (1962, 20, 18), Mills “did not think of himself as a ‘Marxist’” even late in his career, but his encounters with Marxist theory, dissident Marxists, and actually existing socialism “left him intensely interested and pondering, ‘ambiguous’, as he put it, about much of Soviet society. … He was still ‘working on’ Communism and the Soviet bloc when he died: his last book, The Marxists, published shortly after his death, is the last testimony to the rare honesty he brought to that effort.” At a minimum, Mills’ travels made him enthusiastic about the Cuban Revolution and about the prospects of democratic political reform in the Eastern European bloc. He was convinced, if incorrectly, that dissident and liberal intellectuals in Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Russia would eventually triumph in advancing democratic socialism. In this respect, it is also worth pointing out that Mills’ rejection of the working class as an agent of social transformation is sometimes overstated by quoting a few select phrases from White Collar (1951) and his famous essay on “The New Left” (1960). Although it is well known that Mills (1963, 256) rejected the “labor metaphysic” inherited from “Victorian Marxism,” and came to view the “the cultural apparatus, the intellectuals—as a possible, immediate, radical agency of change,” scholars often neglect to mention that in making this proclamation he also qualified his claim by saying: “Forget Victorian Marxism except whenever you need it; and read Lenin again (be careful)—Rosa Luxemburg, too” (1963, 259). At the same time, he wrote: “Of course we can’t ‘write off the working class’. But we must study all that, and freshly. Where labor exists as an agency, of course we must work with it, but we must not retreat [sic] it as The Necessary Lever” of structural historical change (1963, 256). There is no question that Mills was pessimistic about the prospects of structural change in the advanced capitalist societies, but in 1960 when he (1963, 259) declared “We are beginning to move again,” it was his view that a “young intelligentsia” might be the new agent of historic change in both capitalist and Communist societies. It was this concluding point that provided the starting point for a new generation of power structure research, such as G. William Domhoff’s Who Rules America? (1967), which argued that the power elite was merely the leading arm of a cohesive ruling class. Mills opened the intellectual space for a New Left in the United States and became a hero to many of the young intellectuals of the 1960s. The Marxist critique of Mills also laid the foundation for subsequent work by many plain Marxists, such as Michael Harrington (1962), who documented “the other America” alluded to by Herbert Aptheker. Similarly, Eugene Genovese unraveled the political economy of slavery and its enduring impact on Southern society, while Ralph Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society (1969) was “dedicated to the memory of C. Wright Mills.””翻译为中文","output":"C. Wright Mills与盎格鲁-美国马克思主义者的相遇导致了接下来十年真正的理论进展，因为在自由-社会民主实用主义与共产主义正统之间的话语空间中涌现出了一个知识性的“新左派”（Jamison和Eyerman，1994）。米尔斯并没有立即接受马克思主义批评的理论含义，但这促使他重新评估马克思和马克思主义，这在他的最后一本书《马克思主义者》（1962）中显而易见。米尔斯对马克思主义者的回应之所以引人注目，不仅仅是因为他否认自己是马克思主义者，而是因为他提出了一个在1970年代国家辩论中将成为重点的问题：什么是“马克思主义者”？ 米尔斯识别出三种知识类型的马克思主义：庸俗马克思主义、复杂马克思主义和纯粹马克思主义。米尔斯（1962，96）对庸俗马克思主义几乎没什么可说的，但他观察到复杂马克思主义者： ...主要关注马克思主义作为一个社会模型，以及借助这个模型发展的理论。对理论的经验性例外被贬低为次要重要性：构建新理论来解释这些例外，以避免对一般模型进行修订。然后这些理论被追溯到马克思的文本中。...但是当补充假设变得庞大，偏离事实变得压倒性时，整个理论甚至模型变得笨拙。在那一点上，马克思主义变得“复杂化”，以一种无用且晦涩的意义。（15） 米尔斯对复杂马克思主义的定义有些模糊，但他似乎暗示马克思构建了一个资本主义社会的“模型”，在不同的时间和不同的资本主义地理环境中，可以生成不同的政治理论，以解释特定资本主义社会的新发展和特定局势。（16）他还暗示，由于复杂马克思主义者对官方党派路线或特定政治行动类型的政治承诺，他们常常犯下将马克思的资本主义模型简化为历史特定理论的错误，这些理论在党的教条中固化或用以证明预设的政治行动路线。因此，对米尔斯来说，复杂马克思主义通常受到官方党派路线的理论限制，与纯粹马克思主义相反，无法根据变化的时代和环境进行必要的理论调整。 由于米尔斯从未属于任何政治党派——实际上，他可能甚至从未投过票——对米尔斯来说，更有趣的是纯粹马克思主义者。米尔斯定义纯粹马克思主义者为在“马克思自己的传统内”工作的人，无论是同意还是不同意他。一个纯粹马克思主义者是一个理解： 马克思，以及许多后来的马克思主义者，坚定地属于经典社会学思想传统的一部分。他们以学术的方式对待马克思这样的伟大的十九世纪人物；他们将马克思主义的每个后来阶段视为历史特定的。他们普遍同意...他的一般模型和他的思考方式是他们自己知识历史的核心，且对他们尝试把握当代社会世界仍然相关。（米尔斯，1962，96） 米尔斯将一群高度折衷的人包含在这个智力类型中，包括乔恩·罗宾逊、艾萨克·多伊彻、威廉·莫里斯、安东尼奥·格拉姆西、罗莎·卢森堡、G.D.H. 科尔、乔治·卢卡奇、克里斯托弗·考德威尔、让-保罗·萨特、约翰·斯特拉切伊、乔治·索雷尔、E.P. 汤普森、莱舍克·科拉科夫斯基、威廉·A·威廉姆斯、保罗·斯威齐和埃里希·弗罗姆。考虑到米尔斯对莱卡赫曼的早期回复，人们可能会得出结论，如果他没有把自己包括在这个群体中，至少他也在其边缘徘徊。谁知道如果不是因为米尔斯不幸早逝于四十五岁，这种持续的参与可能会导致什么呢？实际上，欧文·豪（1963）是米尔斯的前朋友之一，他指出，尽管“米尔斯不是一个共产主义的皈依者”，但他正转向保罗·斯威齐的《月刊评论》所代表的那种纯粹马克思主义的类型（Horowitz, 1983; 参见Miliband, 1964; Zeitlin, 1989, 47）。（18） 实际上，在出版了《权力精英》之后，米尔斯开始在马克思主义知识圈中活动。1957年，他在生平中首次离开美国，到访了伦敦经济学院并会见了拉尔夫·米利班德（Miliband，1962年，18页）。随后，米尔斯前往波兰，会见了亚当·沙夫（Adam Schaff）和莱泽克·科拉科夫斯基（Lezek Kolakowski）。他在1960年和1961年两次访问苏联，并于1960年访问古巴，为他的书《听，美洲人！》（Listen Yanqui!）收集材料。据米利班德（1962，20，18）说，即便到了职业生涯的晚期，米尔斯“并不认为自己是一个‘马克思主义者’”，但他与马克思主义理论、异见马克思主义者和实际存在的社会主义的相遇“让他极度感兴趣，并对苏联社会的许多方面感到‘暧昧’，正如他所说。...当他去世时，他仍在‘研究’共产主义和苏联集团：他的最后一本书《马克思主义者》，在他去世后不久出版，是他对这一努力所表现出的罕见诚实的最后见证。”至少，米尔斯的旅行让他对古巴革命和东欧集团民主政治改革的前景充满热情。他确信，尽管这是错误的，但匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和俄罗斯的持不同政见者和自由派知识分子最终将在推动民主社会主义方面取得胜利。 在这方面，还值得指出的是，有时通过引用《白领》（1951年）和他著名的论文《新左派》（1960年）中的几句精选语句，过分夸大了米尔斯对工人阶级作为社会转型力量的拒绝。虽然众所周知，米尔斯（1963，256）拒绝了从“维多利亚时代的马克思主义”继承的“劳工形而上学”，并开始将“文化机构、知识分子——作为可能的、即时的、激进的变革力量”看待，但学者们经常忽略提及他在作出这一宣告时也有所保留，他说：“除非你需要它，否则忘记维多利亚时代的马克思主义；也再读一遍列宁（小心点）——也读一读罗莎·卢森堡”（1963，259）。同时，他写道：“当然我们不能‘忽视工人阶级’。但我们必须全面、重新研究所有这些。如果劳工存在为一个力量，当然我们必须与它合作，但我们不必将其视为结构性历史变革的‘必要杠杆’”（1963，256）。毫无疑问，米尔斯对先进资本主义社会的结构变化前景持悲观态度，但在1960年他（1963，259）宣称“我们开始再次行动”时，他的观点是“年轻的知识分子”可能成为资本主义和共产主义社会历史变革的新代理人。 正是这一结论为新一代权力结构研究提供了起点，比如G. 威廉·多姆霍夫的《谁统治美国？》（1967年），该书认为权力精英只是一个紧密团结的统治阶级的领导力量。米尔斯为美国新左派开辟了思想空间，并成为1960年代许多年轻知识分子的英雄。对米尔斯的马克思主义批评也为许多纯粹马克思主义者的后续工作奠定了基础，比如迈克尔·哈灵顿（1962年）记录了赫伯特·阿普泰克所暗示的“另一个美国”。同样，尤金·吉诺维塞揭示了奴隶制的政治经济及其对南部社会的持久影响，而拉尔夫·米利班德的《资本主义社会中的国家》（1969年）是“献给C. Wright Mills的记忆”。"},{"instruction":"请将“Sophisticated Marxists and The Power Elite It is not surprising that Miliband became the target of “sophisticated” Marxist structuralists in the 1970s, but their critique of Plain Marxism—or “historicism” and “voluntarism” in structuralist jargon—was originally directed at C. Wright Mills. Nicos Poulantzas’ Pouvoir Politique et Classes Sociale (1968) was written and published prior to the release of Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society (1969) and, consequently, it is C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite that is actually the focus of Poulantzas’ critique of the “instrumentalist” conception of the state. However, Poulantzas’ main point of contention with Mills was not his empirical analysis, but the fact that Mills would not abandon his Weberian attachment to the analytical separation of the economic and the political. It was a methodological critique of where to begin the analysis of political power, rather than a discussion of political power in capitalist societies. For example, in a chapter on “The Concept of Power,” Poulantzas (1978, 103) cites Mills’ The Power Elite as the exemplar of what he calls “semi-Marxist theories of political elites and political class.” His main criticism is directed at Mills’ “badly loaded phrase” comment, because it allegedly leads to the conclusion that “the groups which take part in political (i.e. power) relations differ, in their theoretical status, from economic social classes, whose existence is elsewhere acknowledged.” Mills’ power structure approach starts with the separation of the economic and the political, which is a separation that Poulantzas rejects as a bourgeois myth from the outset. Hence, Poulantzas (1978, 103, 104) criticizes Mills for acknowledging “the parallel existence of economic social classes in a distorted Marxian sense, according to which the economic ‘class situation’ does not call for relations of power,” and hence, “the failures of this school of thought become obvious in the confusions which result when it tries to establish relations between these ‘economic classes’ and the ‘political groups’.” Although phrased in structuralist terminology, this criticism is not essentially different from the one leveled by Sweezy and Aptheker. In fact, Poulantzas (1978, 320) cites Sweezy’s earlier critique favorably, because he agreed that Mills’ empirical findings “end up by acknowledging the unity of the political elites” and thus suggest theoretical “conclusions diametrically opposed to those which they originally envisaged.” Like Sweezy and Aptheker before him, Poulantzas was convinced that Mills’ empirical findings should have led him to reconceptualize his starting point by adopting a Marxist theoretical position. Poulantzas argues that Mills was unable to make this shift, because his rejection of the concept of a ruling class as “a badly loaded phrase” was based on a “distorted Marxist conception of the dominant class.” Unfortunately, what Poulantzas failed to see is that the masses do not start from a sophisticated Marxist position, but can be moved in that direction by “palpitating facts.” However, the empirical basis on which Sweezy had developed an immanent critique of Mills is a critical research strategy that Poulantzas found unacceptable, because it requires one to arrive at the conclusion of a ruling class, rather than adopt it as a starting axiom. Moreover, Poulantzas rejected as “historicist” and “subjectivist” any research that attempted to draw empirical relationships between the three domains through network analysis, personal and family relationships, common class origins, educational preparation, and so on. Indeed, Poulantzas dismisses Mills’ empirical method of power structure analysis as “fantastical” and “mysterious.” In what would be a preview of the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, Poulantzas (1978, 326) explicitly criticizes C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite, and all similar theories, for seeing: an empirical concentration of all political functions in the hands of the economically-politically dominant class and their practical exercise by the members of that class themselves. For instance, the feudal class exercised control over the functions of political government, of public administration, of the military, etc., but this is effectively not the case for bourgeoisie. And so, on this theory it is necessary theoretically to explain this dislocation by recourse to a conception which locates the basis of political power in the very existence of the state apparatus and which, by confusing state power with state apparatus, attributes to the bureaucracy its own political power … these theories see the conception of a state functioning as a mere tool for the domination of the dominant class.19 Although it is true that Mills had an overly voluntaristic conception of political power, and never explicitly identifies any mechanisms of structural constraint on political power, Sweezy and Aptheker had already made this point more effectively. Moreover, contrary to Poulantzas’ claims during the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, and as I have documented elsewhere at greater length (Barrow, 2007), Miliband largely corrected this problem in The State in Capitalist Society. Yet, Poulantzas (1978, 330) further claims that a “major defect” of Mills’ The Power Elite, and similar works, is that “they do not provide any explanation of the foundation of political power. In addition, they acknowledge a plurality of sources for political power but can offer no explanation of their relations.” However, it is not that Mills fails to offer a conception of power (i.e., the command posts of decision making), it is that Poulantzas rejects the idea of institutions and organizations as repositories of power and therefore rejects the idea of multiple sources of power. It is certainly true that power is a structured relationship between classes, rather than merely an attribute of institutions or organizations, but as later structuralists (and also Miliband) recognized, the structural power of capital is its ability to make decisions about capital investment and disinvestment and they would not have that power if they did not occupy the command posts of financial and industrial corporations. Structural mechanisms such as disinvestment and capital strikes are not automatic and impersonal market forces, but decisions made by economic elites occupying the top command posts of financial and nonfinancial corporations. When “the market” responds to an unfavorable business climate, it is signaling a series of decisions made by those in positions of economic power. Finally, Poulantzas (1978, 117) also claims that Mills’ analysis relies on “the conception of zero-sum power. On this theory, any class or social group thus has as much power as another does not have, and any reduction of the power of a given group is directly translated into an increase in the power of another groups and so on.” This is a “closed systems” argument adopted from Talcott Parsons (1957, 139), but ultimately the real problem for Poulantzas (1978, 118) on this point was not theoretical, but political.20 Poulantzas was concerned that a zero sum concept of power suggests that power is a quantity (instead of a relation) that can be redistributed from one group to another and, therefore, this idea “is the basis of several contemporary forms of reformism.” In other words, Mills’ power structure analysis does not necessitate proletarian revolution, which as the touchstone of structuralist political correctness means that Mills’ thinking, however empirically grounded, must be inherently incorrect. Yet, Goran Therborn’s (1976, 19) assessment of C. Wright Mills was even harsher when he writes that “C. Wright Mills was not primarily a theoretician.” In fact, Goran Therborn gives The Power Elite only two minor (and dismissive) footnotes in What Does the Ruling Class Do When it Rules? (1978, 130 fn. 2, 131 fn. 3), a book published two years after the conclusion of the Poulantzas-Miliband debate. In the end, Therborn (1978, 131, fn. 3) dismisses Mills as merely “a radical liberal.” Martin Carnoy’s survey of The State and Political Theory (1984) makes only three insignificant references to C. Wright Mills in the context of discussing Miliband, while Bob Jessop’s influential book on The Capitalist State (1982) does not contain a single mention of C. Wright Mills. ”翻译为中文","output":"复杂马克思主义者和权力精英 米利班德在1970年代成为“复杂”马克思主义结构主义者的目标并不奇怪，但他们对于纯粹马克思主义（或者在结构主义术语中的“历史主义”和“自愿主义”）的批评最初是针对C.

Wright Mills的《权力精英》。然而，普朗查斯与米尔斯的主要争议点不在于他的实证分析，而在于米尔斯不愿放弃对经济与政治分析上分离的韦伯式坚持。这是一种关于如何开始政治权力分析的方法论批评，而不是对资本主义社会中政治权力的讨论。 例如，在“权力概念”的章节中，普朗查斯（1978，103）引用了米尔斯的《权力精英》，将其称为他所说的“半马克思主义的政治精英和政治阶级理论”的典范。他的主要批评针对的是米尔斯的“含糊其辞”的评论，因为这据称导致了这样的结论：“参与政治（即权力）关系的群体，在其理论地位上，不同于在其他地方承认存在的经济社会阶级。”米尔斯的权力结构方法首先是经济与政治的分离，这是普朗查斯从一开始就拒绝的资产阶级神话。因此，普朗查斯（1978，103, 104）批评米尔斯承认“经济社会阶级的平行存在，以一种扭曲的马克思主义意义，认为经济‘阶级状况’不需要权力关系，”因此，“这一思想流派的失败在于当它试图建立这些‘经济阶级’和‘政治团体’之间的关系时，产生的混乱变得显而易见。”尽管用结构主义术语表述，这一批评与斯威齐和阿普泰克的批评本质上并无不同。 事实上，普朗查斯（1978，320）赞同地引用了斯威齐早期的批评，因为他同意米尔斯的实证发现“最终承认了政治精英的统一”，因此暗示了与他们最初设想的理论“截然相反的结论”。像斯威齐和阿普泰克之前一样，普朗查斯确信米尔斯的实证发现应该导致他重新构想他的出发点，采用马克思主义的理论立场。普朗查斯认为，米尔斯无法做出这一转变，因为他对统治阶级概念的拒绝是基于“扭曲的马克思主义统治阶级观念”。不幸的是，普朗查斯没有看到的是，群众并不是从复杂的马克思主义立场出发，而是可以通过“具体事实”被引向那个方向。 然而，斯威齐基于实证基础对米尔斯进行的内在批评是普朗查斯认为不可接受的关键研究策略，因为它要求人们得出统治阶级的结论，而不是将其作为出发的公理。此外，普朗查斯将试图通过网络分析、个人和家庭关系、共同阶级起源、教育准备等来绘制三个领域之间的实证关系的研究拒绝为“历史主义”和“主观主义”。实际上，普朗查斯将米尔斯的权力结构分析实证方法视为“幻想”和“神秘”。在预示着普朗查斯-米利班德辩论的内容中，普朗查斯（1978，326）明确批评了C. Wright Mills的《权力精英》，以及所有类似理论，因为它们看到： 所有政治职能在经济-政治统治阶级手中的实证集中，以及这个阶级成员自己的实际行使。例如，封建阶级对政治政府的职能、公共行政、军事等的控制，但对于资产阶级来说实际并非如此。因此，根据这一理论，理论上需要通过诉诸于一种观念来解释这种错位，该观念将政治权力的基础定位于国家机器的存在本身，并且通过将国家权力与国家机器混淆，赋予官僚机构自己的政治权力...这些理论看到了一个国家作为统治阶级统治的工具的观念。 尽管米尔斯对政治权力的理解过于自愿主义，并且从未明确指出对政治权力的结构性约束机制，但斯威齐和阿普泰克已经更有效地提出了这一点。此外，与普朗查斯在普朗查斯-米利班德辩论中的主张相反，正如我在其他地方更长篇幅的文献（Barrow, 2007）中记载的，米利班德在《资本主义社会中的国家》中基本纠正了这个问题。然而，普朗查斯（1978，330）进一步声称，米尔斯的《权力精英》及类似作品的一个“主要缺陷”是“它们没有提供政治权力基础的任何解释。此外，它们承认政治权力有多样来源，但却无法解释它们之间的关系。”然而，问题不在于米尔斯未能提出权力的概念（即决策的指挥岗位），而在于普朗查斯拒绝将机构和组织视为权力的存储库，因此拒绝了权力有多个来源的观念。 诚然，权力是阶级之间的结构性关系，而不仅仅是机构或组织的属性，但正如后来的结构主义者（也包括米利班德）所认识到的，资本的结构性权力在于其对资本投资和撤资决策的能力，而如果他们不占据金融和工业公司的指挥岗位，他们就不会拥有这种权力。像撤资和资本罢工这样的结构性机制不是自动和非人格的市场力量，而是由占据金融和非金融公司顶级指挥岗位的经济精英做出的决策。当“市场”对不利的商业环境做出反应时，它传达了经济权力位阶上人们做出的一系列决定。 最后，普朗查斯（1978，117）还声称，米尔斯的分析依赖于“零和权力”的概念。在这一理论上，任何阶级或社会群体的权力就是另一个阶级没有的，而一个给定群体的权力的任何减少都直接转化为另一个群体的权力增加，等等。”这是从塔尔科特·帕森斯（1957，139）那里采纳的“封闭系统”论点，但最终普朗查斯（1978，118）在这一点上的真正问题不是理论上的，而是政治上的。普朗查斯担心零和权力观念表明权力是一种可以从一个群体转移给另一个群体的数量（而不是一种关系），因此，这一观念“是一些当代改革主义形式的基础。”换句话说，米尔斯的权力结构分析并不需要无产阶级革命，这作为结构主义政治正确性的试金石意味着米尔斯的思想，无论多么基于实证，都必然是错误的。 然而，Goran Therborn（1976，19）对C. Wright Mills的评价更为严厉，他写道“C. Wright Mills主要并不是一个理论家。”实际上，Goran Therborn在《统治阶级在统治时做什么？》（1978，130注释2，131注释3）中仅给予《权力精英》两个次要（并带有轻蔑意味的）脚注，这本书在普朗查斯-米利班德辩论结束两年后出版。最终，Therborn（1978，131，注释3）将米尔斯仅仅归为“一个激进的自由主义者”。马丁·卡诺伊在《国家与政治理论》（1984）的调研中只在讨论米利班德时做了对C. Wright Mills三处不重要的提及，而Bob Jessop在其有影响力的《资本主义国家》（1982）一书中未提及C. Wright Mills一次。"},{"instruction":"请将“Moving Beyond C. Wright Mills? There is really not much in the Poulantzas-Miliband debate that was not already present in Poulantzas’ criticism of C. Wright Mills and therein lays the problem. The Poulantzas-Miliband debate merely replayed many of the same issues that had been addressed in earlier critiques of Mills, but the problem for Poulantzas is that Miliband had already moved beyond Mills empirically and conceptually. Miliband constructed a theory of the state anchored in classical Marxist theory, while Mills operationalized elite theory as he inherited it from Vilfredo Pareto and Gaetano Mosca. There are numerous differences that flow from this distinction starting with the fact that Miliband developed a far more nuanced analysis of the capitalist class and its relationship to the working class, while Mills saw only “elites” and “masses.” Miliband marshalled empirical data to conceptualize the structure of class conflict in Western industrialized nations, while Mills saw a loose aggregation of venal elites who were rich, powerful, and famous, but he never went beyond descriptive sociology to an explanatory political economy. Thus, where Miliband saw working class struggle as an ever-present element of contemporary capitalism (as did Poulantzas), Mills could only see an acquiescent and inchoate mass being prodded by discontented intellectuals. In order words, Mills did not articulate a theory of the state, a theory of ideology, or a theory of capitalist development. There were actors and institutions in his description of American elites, but no structures and no theory. Consequently, the early structuralist critique of Miliband was largely directed at a straw man if for no other reason than it failed to recognize the theoretical and empirical advances in Anglo-American Marxism occurred after 1956. Poulantzas seems to have read Miliband through a Millsian lens and, partly for that reason, failed to acknowledge that Miliband’s analysis of the state included a significant structural dimension that was lacking in Mills. Furthermore, Miliband was able to draw on newer power structure research that had identified additional mechanisms of ruling class cohesion, while specifying the processes of ruling class domination. Moreover, Miliband’s analysis did not assume the analytic separation of the economic and political, but it did share Mills’ dictum that this relationship had to be specified in particular historical and geographic configurations. The standard Marxist criticisms of Mills are simply not applicable to Miliband, who had apparently learned from the earlier debate between Mills and the Marxists. Yet, instead of carrying the debate to a higher level of empirical, historical, and theoretical sophistication, as has been done by Sweezy, Aptheker, Harrington, Domhoff, and Miliband, the state debate of the 1970s and 1980s degenerated into an artificial methodological stalemate, which Domhoff (1986–1987, 295) argues became little more than “a dispute among Marxists concerning who was the most Marxist and whose theories were the most politically useful.” Interestingly, in that regard, Mills (1962, 98) observed in an almost prophetic statement that “politically, the plain marxists have generally been among the losers,” because they generally stand outside positions of institutional authority. In fact, Frances Fox Piven (1994, 24) notes that an important historical outcome of the Poulantzas-Miliband debate is that Poulantzasian structuralism achieved hegemony among Marxists. This ideological hegemony gave it the power to (temporarily) write the history of Marxism and the ability to expunge C. Wright Mills from Marxist theory and even a great deal of left-wing analysis generally. Until recently, the name of C. Wright Mills had been largely erased from the memory and vocabulary of Marxism, except as an epithet and an example of what did not count as “real” Marxism. To the extent that Miliband was identified with Mills, his work mistakenly suffered the same fate (Wetherly et al., 2007). At the same time, it should be recognized that the type of work exemplified by C. Wright Mills performs the important function of ideology critique by standing as a critical bridge between the ideology of pluralism and a theoretical critique of the capitalist state. FOUR The Analytic (Mis)Construction of Instrumentalism Ralph Miliband never used the term “instrumentalism” to describe his theory of the state, but rather it was Nicos Poulantzas (1969, 74) who first identified Miliband’s book with “a long Marxist tradition” that allegedly considers the state to be “only a simple tool or instrument manipulated at will by the ruling class.” As documented in Chapter 1, Miliband did anchor his work in a classical Marxist tradition, but Poulantzas’ epithet was not an accurate description of either Miliband’s book or the tradition of instrumentalist theory. However, Poulantzas’ ad hominin is an oversimplification that quickly took hold in the state debate of the 1970s and 1980s and it is a misconstruction that persists to the present time. The significance of this misconstruction is that it has institutionalized an artificial conceptual antinomy between structuralism and instrumentalism, when the two types of analysis should be viewed as simultaneous forms of analysis that are both necessary to an explanation of specific state policies and to an understanding of the historical development of state forms. The Defining Moment for an Ideal-Type A defining moment in the extended reproduction of Poulantzas’ theoretical caricature of instrumentalism was the seminal article in Monthly Review by David A. Gold, Clarence Lo, and Erik Olin Wright (1975a, 31) on “Recent Developments in Marxist Theories of the Capitalist State.” This highly influential article followed Poulantzas’ lead by defining instrumentalism as “a theory in which the ties between the ruling class and state are systematically examined, while the structural context within which those ties occur remains largely theoretically unorganized.” Shortly thereafter, in an equally influential Socialist Review article, Fred Block (1977, 8) defined instrumentalism as “the orthodox Marxist view of the state because it views the state as a simple tool or instrument of ruling-class purposes.”1 These forays into state theory effectively began the process of institutionalizing Poulantzas’ polemical jibe as a permanent part of the state debate even though G. William Domhoff (1976) correctly pointed out at the time that if one accepted this definition of instrumentalism then no one, especially Ralph Miliband, actually subscribed to an instrumentalist theory of the state. Indeed, it should have been highly instructive at the time that Block’s (1977, 8–10) subsequent critique of instrumentalism does not cite a single published work or author to exemplify his specific claims about instrumentalism. Ironically, even the most strident critics of instrumentalism recognized early on that very few theoretical works on the state could actually be considered “pure examples of an instrumentalist, structuralist, or Hegelian-Marxist perspective” (Gold, Lo, and Wright, 1975a, 31), because these concepts are themselves analytically constructed ideal-types. However, this did not prevent Gold, Lo, and Wright (1975a, 32) from proclaiming that “Ralph Miliband expresses this position clearly.” Similarly, Bob Jessop’s (1982, 15) influential work on The Capitalist State identified The State in Capitalist Society as “a classic work” of instrumentalist theory, while Gordon L. Clark and Michael Dear (1984, 6–27) labeled The State in Capitalist Society as “probably the best example of the instrumentalist model.” Yet, even as Gold, Lo, and Wright (1975a, 33) were in the process of constructing the instrumentalist-structuralist dichotomy, they simultaneously acknowledged that “there are, of course, examples of instrumentalist work done at various levels of sophistication” and they conceded that Ralph Miliband “most notably” had “attempted to situate the analysis of personal connections in a more structural context.” Jessop (1982, 15) also qualified his critique of Miliband with the observation that “it would be wrong to suggest that Miliband is committed to a simple instrumentalist position.” Thus, one critic after another acknowledges the sophisticated, nuanced, and multilevel analysis developed in The State in Capitalist Society, but then still proceed to dismiss his work on the basis of criticisms that apply only to an artificially constructed ideal type, rather than to his actual published works. It is not Miliband’s actual theorizing that was ever at issue, but the so-called logic of a theoretical position artificially imputed to him by critics. Consequently, a long list of broadsides have been directed against Miliband’s alleged instrumentalism and most of these criticisms revolve around four major “problems” that had been articulated earlier by Poulantzas: (1) the problem of the subject, (2) the problem of the ideological apparatuses, (3) the problem of state autonomy, and (4) the problem of economic and social reform. Once extracted from the epistemological and methodological issues that preoccupied Poulantzas, it is easier to recognize the extent to which these problems were falsely ascribed to Miliband by Poulantzas and his followers largely by ignoring significant elements of Miliband’s political theory. ”翻译为中文","output":"超越C.

Wright Mills的批评中并没有什么是新的。这场辩论不过是将之前针对米尔斯的批评重新演绎一遍，但对于普朗查斯来说，问题在于米利班德在经验和概念上已经超越了米尔斯。米利班德基于古典马克思主义理论构建了关于国家的理论，而米尔斯则继承并运用了来自维尔弗雷多·帕雷托和盖塔诺·莫斯卡的精英理论。这一区别导致了诸多不同之处，米利班德对资产阶级及其与工人阶级的关系进行了更为细致的分析，而米尔斯则仅仅看到了“精英”和“群众”。米利班德利用实证数据来概念化西方工业化国家中阶级冲突的结构，而米尔斯则看到了一个由富人、有权力和有名望的精英松散聚合的集体，但他未能超越描述性社会学进入解释性政治经济学。因此，当米利班德（和普朗查斯一样）将工人阶级斗争视为当代资本主义中一个持续存在的元素时，米尔斯只能看到一个被不满的知识分子驱动的顺服且松散的群体。换言之，米尔斯没有提出一个国家理论、意识形态理论，或是资本主义发展理论。在他对美国精英的描述中，虽有行为主体和机构，却缺乏结构和理论。 因此，针对米利班德的早期结构主义批评大多是在攻击一个稻草人，主要原因是这些批评未能认识到1956年之后盎格鲁-美国马克思主义在理论和实证上的进展。普朗查斯似乎是通过米尔斯主义的视角来阅读米利班德的，部分原因是他未能承认米利班德的国家分析中包含了米尔斯所缺少的重要结构维度。此外，米利班德还借鉴了更新的权力结构研究，这些研究确认了统治阶级凝聚力的额外机制并具体说明了统治阶级统治的过程。此外，米利班德的分析没有假设经济与政治之间分析上的分离，但他确实继承了米尔斯的那句格言：这种关系必须在特定的历史和地理配置中得以具体说明。对米尔斯标准的马克思主义批评并不适用于米利班德，后者显然从米尔斯与马克思主义者之间早期的辩论中学到了一些东西。 然而，与斯威齐、阿普泰克、哈灵顿、多姆霍夫和米利班德等人的做法不同，他们将辩论提升到了更高的实证、历史和理论复杂度，1970年代和1980年代的国家辩论却沦为了一场人为的方法论僵局，多姆霍夫（1986-1987, 295）认为这不过变成了马克思主义者间关于谁是更加马克思主义以及谁的理论更具政治功用的争论。有趣的是，米尔斯（1962, 98）几乎是预言性地指出，“从政治角度来看，纯粹的马克思主义者通常是失败者”，因为他们通常站在制度权威之外。实际上，弗朗西斯·福克斯·皮文（1994, 24）指出，普朗查斯-米利班德辩论的一个重要历史结果是普朗查斯主义结构主义在马克思主义者中取得了霸权。这种意识形态霸权让它有能力（暂时地）书写马克思主义的历史，并有能力从马克思主义理论甚至大量左翼分析中抹去C. Wright Mills的贡献。直到最近，C. Wright Mills的名字基本上从马克思主义的记忆和词汇中被抹去，除非作为一个不被看作“真正”马克思主义的例子的无礼用语。因为米利班德与米尔斯被联系在一起，他的工作错误地遭受了同样的命运（Wetherly等，2007）。与此同时，应当认识到，C. Wright Mills所代表的工作类型通过充当多元主义意识形态与资本主义国家理念批判之间的批判性桥梁，执行了重要的意识形态批判功能。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Cette approche est particulièrement utile dans les espaces communs ou les zones rarement utilisées, où il n'est pas nécessaire de maintenir l'éclairage activé en permanence, offrant ainsi une économie d'énergie significative. La minuterie fonctionne grâce à l'utilisation d'une bobine ou d'un composant électronique comme un transistor, qui, lorsqu'il est activé par une pression sur un bouton, génère un champ magnétique (dans le cas d'une bobine) ou modifie l'état du circuit (dans le cas d'un transistor), allumant les lumières. La durée pendant laquelle les lumières restent allumées est réglable grâce à un potentiomètre inclus dans le boîtier de la minuterie, offrant une flexibilité selon les besoins de l'utilisateur. De plus, la minuterie peut comporter un mode « avec effet » où appuyer sur le bouton pendant que les lumières sont déjà allumées réinitialise le temps, recommençant le compte à rebours pour l'extinction automatique, ou un mode « sans effet », où une pression supplémentaire sur le bouton n'a aucun impact sur la durée restante avant l'extinction. Ce choix de configuration permet une plus grande adaptabilité aux différents contextes d'utilisation. En résumé, une minuterie pour circuits d'éclairage offre une manière automatique et économique de gérer l'éclairage, en limitant le gaspillage d'énergie et en contribuant à réduire les coûts d'électricité, tout en s'adaptant aux habitudes et aux besoins spécifiques des utilisateurs."},{"instruction":"2- Installation d’un télérupteur : Le télérupteur est un appareil électrique permettant la commande de l'éclairage (allumage ou extinction des lampes), de plus de deux endroits différents.

Cette capacité en fait une option idéale pour de grandes pièces, des couloirs longs, ou des maisons à plusieurs étages, où il est pratique de pouvoir contrôler l'éclairage depuis de multiples endroits. Le cœur du télérupteur est une bobine qui, lorsqu'elle reçoit une impulsion électrique à partir d'un bouton poussoir, active l'appareil pour qu'il ferme le circuit d'éclairage. Cela rend les lampes connectées au circuit allumées. Une fois qu'une nouvelle impulsion est envoyée par un autre appui sur le bouton (peu importe duquel, parmi les multiples boutons connectés au système), la bobine agit de nouveau pour ouvrir le circuit, éteignant ainsi les lampes. Le système se distingue par ses caractéristiques uniques : - **Bobine Commandée par les Boutons Poussoirs :** C'est elle qui reçoit l'impulsion électrique et déclenche l'action du télérupteur. - **Contacts (Circuit de Puissance) :** Ils permettent de contrôler l'allumage ou l'extinction des points lumineux à chaque action sur un bouton poussoir. - **Système d’Accrochage Mécanique :** Il est essentiel pour maintenir le contact du télérupteur en position ouverte ou fermée, assurant ainsi que les lumières restent dans l'état désiré (allumées ou éteintes) jusqu'à ce qu'une nouvelle action soit effectuée.

This complex analysis involves the calculation of technical indicators, signal generation based on these indicators, and implementation of a trading strategy for backtesting. However, there are several points in the code and its approach that require attention or correction for optimal functionality and performance. 1. **Efficiency and Optimization**: The approach to calculating indicators (MACD, Twin Range Filter, and Engulfing pattern) for every row using \`df.apply()\` with the lambda function recalculating the indicator for the entire DataFrame up to the current row is highly inefficient. This could lead to very long execution times, especially with larger datasets. Instead, indicators should be calculated once for the whole DataFrame without using \`apply()\`. For indicators relying on past values in a row-wise calculation, consider adjusting the logic to operate on the whole series/vector where possible. 2. **Correctness in Strategy Logic**: - The strategies, especially how signals are generated and used, could potentially be incorrect or not aligned with the intended trading logic. For example, the conditions for generating buy or sell signals seem arbitrary and may not properly represent a sound trading strategy. - In the \`ChubbStrategy\` class, \`self.signal1\` retrieves signals but is done incorrectly. This lambda function does not dynamically change with new data in the backtesting loop. \`self.signal1\` will not act as expected, as it's not updating with each new tick but is rather fixed at instantiation. 3. **Issues with MetaTrader5 (MT5) initialization and data usage**: - The code snippet calls \`mt5.initialize()\` without a subsequent task if the initialization fails, which could lead to errors if MT5 is not correctly initialized. - The usage of MT5 is correct for acquiring historical data, but you'd need to ensure that the MT5 terminal is logged in and connected to a trade server for this to work successfully. This part is environment-specific and cannot be debugged in a non-MT5 environment. 4. **Backtesting Considerations**: - The approach to buy/sell in \`ChubbStrategy\` uses hard-coded values for stop loss and take profit, which may not be suitable for all market conditions or symbols. These should ideally be dynamically calculated based on volatility or some risk management criteria. - The setting of the \`signal\` indicator directly in the DataFrame used for backtesting effectively looks ahead, introducing look-ahead bias since the signal calculation uses future data not available at that moment in real trading. 5. **General Code Improvement Recommendations**: - The transformation and calculation parts of the code should be separated from the data retrieval and main logic for clarity and maintenance. - Error checking and handling should be added, especially for operations that depend on external systems (like MetaTrader5 data retrieval) or where operations could fail due to data issues. - Consider breaking down complex functions into smaller, testable parts to improve readability and maintainability. 6. **Technical Indicator Calculations**: - Use existing functions from libraries like TA-Lib efficiently, calling them once on the whole dataset or appropriately using their results, instead of recalculating within a loop or an apply function. **Overall**, while the approach attempts to integrate technical analysis with a backtesting strategy, its execution needs significant optimization and correction to ensure it functions correctly, efficiently, and aligns with practical trading strategies."},{"instruction":"how to fix this error : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exception Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-34-81bbf9f943b4> in <cell line: 2>() 1 # df['macd'] = df.apply(lambda x: macd(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) ----> 2 df['trf'] = df.apply(lambda x: twin_range_filter(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 3 # df['engulfing'] = df.apply(lambda x: detect_engulfing(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 7 frames /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/frame.py in apply(self, func, axis, raw, result_type, args, **kwargs) 9421 kwargs=kwargs, 9422 ) -> 9423 return op.apply().__finalize__(self, method=\\"apply\\") 9424 9425 def applymap( /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/apply.py in apply(self) 676 return self.apply_raw() 677 --> 678 return self.apply_standard() 679 680 def agg(self): /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/apply.py in apply_standard(self) 796 797 def apply_standard(self): --> 798 results, res_index = self.apply_series_generator() 799 800 # wrap results /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/apply.py in apply_series_generator(self) 812 for i, v in enumerate(series_gen): 813 # ignore SettingWithCopy here in case the user mutates --> 814 results[i] = self.f(v) 815 if isinstance(results[i], ABCSeries): 816 # If we have a view on v, we need to make a copy because <ipython-input-34-81bbf9f943b4> in <lambda>(x) 1 # df['macd'] = df.apply(lambda x: macd(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) ----> 2 df['trf'] = df.apply(lambda x: twin_range_filter(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 3 # df['engulfing'] = df.apply(lambda x: detect_engulfing(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) <ipython-input-33-c9fd72a07a5e> in twin_range_filter(df) 10 return smoothrng 11 per1, mult1, per2, mult2 = 27, 1.6, 55, 2.0 ---> 12 smrng1 = smoothrng(close, per1, mult1) 13 smrng2 = smoothrng(close, per2, mult2) 14 smrng = (smrng1 + smrng2) / 2 <ipython-input-33-c9fd72a07a5e> in smoothrng(x, t, m) 6 def smoothrng(x, t, m): 7 wper = t * 2 - 1 ----> 8 avrng = talib.EMA(np.abs(x.diff()), timeperiod=t) 9 smoothrng = talib.EMA(avrng, timeperiod=wper) * m 10 return smoothrng /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/talib/__init__.py in wrapper(*args, **kwargs) 33 for k, v in kwargs.items()} 34 ---> 35 result = func(*args, **kwargs) 36 37 # check to see if we got a streaming result talib/_func.pxi in talib._ta_lib.EMA() talib/_func.pxi in talib._ta_lib.check_begidx1() Exception: inputs are all NaN","output":"The error you're encountering indicates that the function is receiving inputs that are all \`NaN\` values, which occurs during the calculation in the \`twin_range_filter\` function, specifically in the \`smoothrng\` where it attempts to calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) using the \`talib.EMA\` function. This issue is commonly due to attempting to apply the function to a part of the DataFrame where the necessary data hasn't fully populated yet, especially with financial time series data where some calculations require a certain number of data points to produce a valid output (e.g., calculating an EMA with a period of 27 requires at least 27 data points). Here's how you can adjust your approach to avoid this error: 1. **Pre-calculation Outside of Apply**: Calculate indicators that don't inherently depend on an iterative row-wise application outside \`df.apply()\` to improve performance and avoid this kind of error. You can then assign these indicators back to the DataFrame. 2. **Check for Sufficient Data**: Before trying to calculate an indicator for a subsection of your DataFrame, ensure that there's enough data for that calculation to make sense. This is especially crucial for the initial rows where you might not have enough historical data points. 3. **Replace or Skip NaN Values Before Applying Indicators**: Ensure that you're handling or replacing \`NaN\` values in your data before applying operations that expect numeric input. Some preprocessing to clean or fill missing data might be necessary. Let's address the error pragmatically with a simplified fix. Focus on adjusting the \`twin_range_filter\` function's calling context to avoid \`NaN\` complications: \`\`\`python def twin_range_filter(df): # Assuming this function is edited to return the TRF array correctly and not as part of the apply pass # Your existing logic here # Instead of applying the function row by row: # df['trf'] = df.apply(lambda x: twin_range_filter(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) # Calculate once for the entire DataFrame (example shown for theoretical clarity; adapt as per your logic): df['trf'] = twin_range_filter(df) # Ensure this function is adapted to work with entire DataFrame \`\`\` Revising functions that calculate indicators (\`macd\`, \`twin_range_filter\`, and \`detect_engulfing\`) to work with the entire DataFrame rather than slicing per row will significantly improve performance and avoid issues like the one you're encountering. Here's an example adjustment for one of the functions to give a clearer idea. Note that this specifically doesn't address the complete logic but provides a direction: \`\`\`python # Example of adjusting a simplified version of MACD calculation for the entire DataFrame def macd(df): macd, signal, hist = talib.MACD(df['close'], fastperiod=12, slowperiod=26, signalperiod=9) # This assumes you'll handle the indicator application and logic adjustment for the entire DataFrame return macd - signal # For illustrative purposes df['macd_signal'] = macd(df) # Simplified for illustration \`\`\` Adapt your indicator and strategy logic accordingly, aligning with how these financial libraries intend for batch operations on series/dataframes rather than iterative row-wise application for better performance and to prevent errors like \`Exception: inputs are all NaN\`."},{"instruction":"type this correction : def twin_range_filter(df): # Assuming this function is edited to return the TRF array correctly and not as part of the apply pass # Your existing logic here","output":"To correct and optimize the \`twin_range_filter(df)\` function to avoid the error \\"\`inputs are all NaN\`\\" and to ensure it processes the entire DataFrame without applying it row-wise, we need to adjust its implementation. For demonstration, I'll present an improved approach based on the original, complex logic provided, focusing on performing calculations efficiently for the entire DataFrame without using the \`apply()\` method iteratively for each row. Given the context and the descriptive nature of your existing code, let's revise the \`twin_range_filter\` function. This revision will aim to calculate the Smooth Range (smrng), Filter (filt), Final Upper Bound (FUB), and Final Lower Bound (FLB) for the entire series at once. The code adjustment requires maintaining the logic intact while ensuring it operates over the whole DataFrame effectively.

This part should be adjusted according to your specific trading strategy. This revised approach should not only avoid the issue of calculations on insufficient data (leading to \\"all NaN\\" error) but also enhance performance significantly by leveraging vectorized operations where possible."},{"instruction":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValueError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-47-ac7f13c739fe> in <cell line: 2>() 1 # df['macd'] = df.apply(lambda x: macd(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) ----> 2 df['trf'] = twin_range_filter(df) 3 df 4 # df['engulfing'] = df.apply(lambda x: detect_engulfing(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 1 frames /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/frame.py in __setitem__(self, key, value) 3938 self._setitem_array(key, value) 3939 elif isinstance(value, DataFrame): -> 3940 self._set_item_frame_value(key, value) 3941 elif ( 3942 is_list_like(value) /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/frame.py in _set_item_frame_value(self, key, value) 4067 len_cols = 1 if is_scalar(cols) or isinstance(cols, tuple) else len(cols) 4068 if len_cols != len(value.columns): -> 4069 raise ValueError(\\"Columns must be same length as key\\") 4070 4071 # align right-hand-side columns if self.columns ValueError: Columns must be same length as key","output":"The error you're encountering, \`ValueError: Columns must be same length as key\`, typically occurs when trying to assign a DataFrame (or a data structure with multiple columns) directly into a single column of another DataFrame.

Let's correct and make the function more consistent: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import pandas as pd import talib def twin_range_filter(df): df = df.copy() close = df['close'] # Apply smooth range filter def smoothrng(x, t, m): wper = t * 2 - 1 avrng = talib.EMA(np.abs(x.diff()), timeperiod=t) smoothrng = talib.EMA(avrng, timeperiod=wper) * m return smoothrng def rngfilt(x, r): rngfilt = x.copy() for i in range(1, len(x)): prev_val = rngfilt.iloc[i-1] if x.iloc[i] > prev_val: rngfilt.iloc[i] = max(prev_val, x.iloc[i] - r.iloc[i]) else: rngfilt.iloc[i] = min(prev_val, x.iloc[i] + r.iloc[i]) return rngfilt per1, mult1, per2, mult2 = 27, 1.6, 55, 2.0 smrng1 = smoothrng(close, per1, mult1) smrng2 = smoothrng(close, per2, mult2) smrng = (smrng1 + smrng2) / 2 filt = rngfilt(close, smrng) STR = filt + smrng STS = filt - smrng FUB = [STR.iloc[0]] FLB = [STS.iloc[0]] for i in range(1, len(df)): FUB.append(STR.iloc[i] if (STR.iloc[i] < STR.iloc[i-1]) or (close.iloc[i-1] > FUB[i-1]) else FUB[i-1]) FLB.append(STS.iloc[i] if (STS.iloc[i] > STS.iloc[i-1]) or (close.iloc[i-1] < FLB[i-1]) else FLB[i-1]) FUB = np.array(FUB) FLB = np.array(FLB) df['FUB'] = FUB df['FLB'] = FLB # Determine TRF logic here TRF = np.where(close > FUB, FUB, np.where(close < FLB, FLB, np.nan)) df['TRF'] = np.nan_to_num(TRF, nan=np.roll(TRF, 1)) # Mock logic for TRF, fill initial NaN with previous non-NaN value long_signal = close > np.roll(FUB, 1) short_signal = close < np.roll(FLB, 1) df['long_signal'] = long_signal df['short_signal'] = short_signal return df \`\`\` This revised version addresses several key issues: 1. **Consistency in Return Values**: The function now consistently returns a DataFrame augmented with the new columns for the trade filter, bounds, and signals, maintaining a consistent structure. 2. **Clear Calculation Logic**: Each part of the function has been kept clear and logically structured to ensure the calculations are understandable and maintainable. 3. **Signal Handling**: Created signals are based on the conditions provided. Any tuning required for these signals may involve adjusting these conditions or how \`TRF\` is computed. Please be aware that I included a mock logic for \`TRF\` filling with \`np.nan_to_num(TRF, nan=np.roll(TRF, 1))\`, as the original intention behind \`TRF\` wasn't fully clear from the provided code. You might want to adjust this to fit your exact requirements. The primary focus was on correctly integrating with \`df\` and ensuring the various additions and logical operations are handled appropriately."},{"instruction":"seharus nya hasil dari twin range filter jika if df.iloc[-1]['long_signal']: return 1 elif df.iloc[-1]['short_signal']: return 2 ,,,, yang hana mengembalikan antara nilai 1 atau 2 sesuai perhitungan per baris","output":"If your goal with the \`twin_range_filter\` function is strictly to return a single value (either 1 or 2) to indicate the last row's signal status (whether it's a long or short signal) instead of modifying and returning the entire DataFrame, you should focus on simplifying the function to assess just the last row's condition based on your criteria.

The following are common ways to achieve this in Python: 1. **Using Concurrent Futures (ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor):** For IO-bound tasks like making HTTP requests, \`ThreadPoolExecutor\` is often a better choice since the bottleneck is usually waiting for the network rather than CPU processing. However, if BeautifulSoup's parsing becomes the bottleneck (less likely but could happen with large responses), you might experiment with \`ProcessPoolExecutor\`. 2. **AsyncIO with aiohttp:** For an entirely asynchronous approach. Let's go with the \`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor\` since it's most likely to offer significant improvements for your case, which is primarily IO-bound: # Updated Function with Concurrent Futures \`\`\`python from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup def get_directories(url): try: response = requests.get(url) if response.status_code == 200: soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') directories = [a.get_text() for a in soup.find_all('a') if a.get_text().endswith('/')] return directories else: print(f\\"Error fetching directories for {url}: HTTP {response.status_code}\\") return [] except Exception as e: print(f\\"Error fetching directories for {url}: {str(e)}\\") return [] def get_directories_concurrently(url_list): with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=20) as executor: # Adjust the number of workers based on your environment futures = {executor.submit(get_directories, url): url for url in url_list} results = [] for future in as_completed(futures): directories = future.result() results.append(directories) return results \`\`\` # Usage You would replace your list comprehension: \`\`\`python [get_directories(x) for x in rf[\\"path\\"]] \`\`\` With a call to the new function: \`\`\`python directories = get_directories_concurrently(rf[\\"path\\"]) \`\`\` # Notes - **Adjust the Pool Size (\`max_workers\`) as Necessary:** The optimal number of workers depends on your machine's capabilities and the nature of the task. While network-bound tasks can handle many workers, setting the number too high can lead to diminishing returns or produce additional overhead. - **Consider Rate Limiting:** If you're making many requests to the same website, consider implementing rate-limiting or respecting \`robots.txt\` rules to avoid getting IP-banned. - **Async Approach**: If you're dealing with a very large scale of URLs or need every bit of performance, exploring \`asyncio\` with \`aiohttp\` might offer further benefits. This approach requires a different programming model where your code execution is event-driven. - **Error Handling:** More robust error handling and retry logic might be beneficial if you expect network errors or other intermittent issues. Using this method will allow you to process the URLs in parallel, significantly speeding up the task compared to a sequential approach."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As we dive into the composition, the layers tell a story that intertwines physical and emotional landscapes. **Foreground:** The emotional girl is central, evoking a sense of vulnerability and introspection. Her pose is elegant yet burdened; she might be seated or standing in a way that suggests a moment of deep contemplation or overwhelming emotion. Her dress, an extension of her emotional state, flows in an elegant, almost ethereal manner, swirling around her in muted tones of blues and grays, perhaps with hints of faded roses or lavenders. The fabric, while appearing luxurious and flowing, is integrated seamlessly into the abstract forms that surround her, emphasizing both the elegance and the distorted perception of her world. **Skin Lesions as Narratives:** On her skin, lesions are visible but interpreted artistically as a surreal representation of her internal and external struggles. These are not just marks but symbols—perhaps appearing as slightly more vivid patches or abstract shapes within the muted color scheme, integrating seamlessly with the distortions of her form and dress. They tell a story of pain, struggle, and perhaps illness, embedding deeper narrative layers to the emotional landscape portrayed. The lesions could resemble cracked porcelain, subtly echoing the wood's texture in the background, suggesting her fragility and the pressures that threaten to break her. **Background:** Set against cracked dry wood, the background serves as both a literal and metaphorical foundation for the composition. The wood, with its deep cracks and muted, almost desolate, appearance, complements the overall dreamlike, somewhat melancholic atmosphere. The cracks might appear to mirror the lesions on her skin, suggesting a profound connection between the girl and her environment. This background adds depth and texture, emphasizing the surreal and abstract quality of the work. Light and shadow play across the wood, creating a subtle interplay that hints at the complexities of her inner world. **Style and Atmosphere:** Embracing the essence of surrealist expressionism, the artwork distorts reality to evoke a strong emotional response. Forms and figures might blend and melt into one another, with the girl’s figure, her dress, and the surrounding elements intertwining in a dreamlike dance. The muted color scheme—composed of mainly blues, grays, and soft, earthy tones—reinforces the surreal, melancholic atmosphere. Colors might bleed into one another, suggesting both the fluidity of emotion and the instability of her perceived reality. A slight abstract treatment of the figures and elements further amplifies the expressionist intent, making the viewer feel the emotional turmoil and ethereal beauty intertwined in the girl’s existence. **Conclusion:** This mixed-media piece transcends the mere visual to become a deeply affecting exploration of emotional and physical affliction, all while maintaining a haunting beauty. The use of surrealist expressionism allows for an abstract and distorted representation that challenges perceptions, making the invisible struggles visible in a poignant, compelling manner. Through the muted color scheme and dreamlike atmosphere, the artwork invites the viewer into a deeply personal experience, one that is both intimate and universal."},{"instruction":"Mixed media artwork + Emotional girl + Elegant dress + Skin lesions as a storytelling element + In the style of surrealist expressionism, muted color scheme, dreamlike atmosphere, abstract and distorted forms on a cracked dry wood background, normal, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, Begin title with \\"Matte Canvas\\", do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"Matte Canvas: Surreal Emotion, Girl in Elegant Dress with Story of Lesions, Muted Dreamlike Art"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Minimalist Cream Furry Cozy Coffee Cup - Chic White Home Decor Accessory.

The assassination of US Civil War survivor and Confederate revanchist Princeton dean turned American dictator Woodrow Wilson by a joint collaboration of the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai in 1914 upon discovery of his plans to put the USA in WW1 on the side of the Entente throws the USA into chaos, allowing the Central Powers consisting of the post 1871, pre 1919 German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled federal parliamentary semi-constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Prussia ruling over much of modern-day eastern Germany and Western Poland along with Russian Kalingard-dominated Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the German Empire, The Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine ruled Federal parliamentary constitutional imperial royal monarchy of the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire] over Illryia [Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina], Greater Hungary [Hungary, Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje, Vojvodina and Prekmurje in Serbia, Transylvania and most of the Banat in Romania, Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland], Bohemia and Moravia [Czechia and Slovakia] and Galicia-Lodomeria in Ukraine from [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy's/Austria-Hungarian Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Austria [Austria, Slovenia, South Tyrol], , the Catholic cadet branch of the original German branch of the current British royal family, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial monarchy of the Tsardom of Bulgaria/Third Bulgarian Tsardom/Restored Byzantine Empire ruling over Bulgaria, the Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial royal absolute Islamic monarchy of the Sublime Ottoman State/Eastern Roman Sultanate/Islamic Rome ruling [the Ottoman Empire] over the Arab Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Kuwait from [the Ottoman Empire's stronghold and homebase] Turkey, [the assassination of Woodrow Wilson in this timeline allowing the Central Powers] to win WW1 and [the Central Powers in this timeline] subsequently survive the late 1910s and early 1920s into the rest of the 20th century, the 21th century and beyond in this timeline. Japan also gets to keep its post-WW1 protectorate of the federal parliamentary presidential republic of the Far Eastern Republic on Russia's East Coast post-1922 in this timeline due to the USSR in this timeline essentially being a Siberian rump state surrounded by Ottoman satellite monarchies in Central Asia, Pahlavi-ruled Iran, German and Austria-Hungarian satellite states in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Caucuses and the German-Danish-Russian House of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional absolute royal imperial monarchy of the Russian Empire/Third Rome/Third Roman Empire/Russian Rome/Russian Byzantium managing to survive in European Russia post Russian Civil War, albiet under the control of the Russian nationalist, Russian supremacist, Russian Orthodox supremacist, proto-fascist White faction as a joint German-Austrian protectorate in this timeline. During the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between Imperial Japan, the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China, Manchuria and Inner Mongolia against the Kuomingtang-ruled Nationalist China based in Guangdong and Guangxi, the USA and the USSR, the Japanese launch a successful military operation against the Han Chinese bandit faction/warlord clique/military junta/Beiyang Government faction of the Manchurian-based Fengtian Clique immediately after the death of the Fengtian Clique's leader, the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system and then combined warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique, \\"the Old Marshal\\" Zhang Zhuolin in 1928 in this timeline, with Zhuolin's son and thus the rightful heir of Zhuolin's positions as warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique, Zhang Xueliang, vanishing mysteriously sometime after the invasion, never to be seen again. The Manchu Qing Imperial Court in Manchuria, which had continued existing in Manchuria even after the Xinhai Revolution is given control of the Fengtian Clique after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in this timeline, with the last Emperor of the Qing Empire, Aisin-Gioro Pu-Yi, taking Zhuolin's positions as warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique after the Qing Imperial Court take over of the Fengtian Clique in this timeline. The Fengtian Clique's armed wing and the Manchurian-based branch of the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China's armed wing and combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, the National Pacification Army, becomes a modern, developed, highly advanced and technical military force with Japanese support after the Qing Imperial Court seizes control of the Fengtian Clique in this timeline. This Qing Imperial court-ruled Fengtian Clique later becomes the pre-WW2, WW2-era, Imperial Japanese era protectorate of the Qing imperial family, the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled and monarchist, Manchurian nationalist, anti-communist, Pan Asian political party Concordia Association-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional imperial royal parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo, with Pu-Yi becoming Manchukuo's first Emperor under the combined regal and era name of Kangte [Kant]. Police units in Manchuria nominally operating under the Beiyang Government's control but in reality under the Fengtian Clique's control also become the main law enforcement agency of Manchukuo, managing the central police department responsible for all police in Manchuria after Manchuko’s formation, with a Maritime Police to combat smuggling along with cracking down on smuggling and maintain maritime security within Manchurian waters, first under the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security and then under the General Directorate of Security Affairs, the Manchukuo Police after the formation of Manchukuo both in real life and this timeline. The National Pacification Army becomes Manchukuo’s combined armed forces, the Manchukuo Imperial Army after the formation of Manchukuo both in real life and in this timeline. Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions then come under the rule of the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled absolute royal khanate of the Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in 1939 like in real life, with the Inner Mongolian military units consisting of ethnic Mongols, with some Han Chinese infantry formations in the service of the Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang, the Inner Mongolian Army being formed from both Han Chinese and Mongolian Beiyang Army, National Pacification Army and even the Kuomingtang's armed wing and the Nationalist Chinese Armed Forces, the National Revolutionary Army units in Chahar and Suiyan under Japanese supervision like in real life. Covert operations against Nationalist Chinese leadership and military personnel in addition to US and Soviet personnel covertly assisting the Nationalist Chinese by the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai lead to the destabilization of Nationalist China and its fragmentation into various cliques and warlord states. The Japanese also facilitate the restoration of the pre-Qing Ming dynasty ruled by the Jurchen/Manchurian-Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu as its reigning imperial family through the Japanese protectorate of the Beiyang Government, first as a regency in the form of the Beiyang Government-ruled Provisional Government of the Republic of China ruling over Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan and Jiangsu from 7 July 1937-to March 30 1940 and the Reformed Government of the Republic of China ruling over Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui along with Nanjing/Nanking and Shanghai from 28 March 1938 to March 30, 1940 and finally through the Nationalist Chinese government branch of the Reorganized National Government headed by Dr. Sun Yat Sen's protoge and true heir Wang Jingwei formed on 30 March 1940, which is a restored Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China melding the best elements of the Beiyang Government and Nationalist China with a combination of Beiyang and Nationalist Chinese heradly, symbols and icongraphy with the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as the reigning imperial family instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants with Jingwei being its prime minister instead of a Japanese protectorate Nationalist Chinese Republic like in real life and [the Japanese] coopt the Ming restorationist millennialist society of the Yellow Sand Society into the \\"New People's Society\\" a political organ that was designed to spread the government's ideas to the public and mobilize economic and military support for the Provisional Government and Japan, whose activities ranged from from training future civil servants, sending students to Japan, giving medical services to remote villages, providing disaster relief, establish free tea houses, promoting Chinese art and pilgrimages to Confucian temples, as well as discussing political events in their radio stations and official newspaper, the New People's Daily, emphasising Confucian virtues, familial piety, respect for authority, and devotion to scholarship in this timeline. The restoration of the Ming through the Reorganized Nationalist Government as the government of China by the Japanese deals a severe blow to the Nationalist Chinese war effort in this timeline with units of the Kuomingtang's armed wing and the Nationalist Chinese Armed Forces, thee National Revolutionary Army, defecting to the Reorganized Nationalist Government in droves. The leader of the Kuomingtang since Sun Yat-Sen's death in 1925 and thus the dictator of Nationalist China since then, the Cantonese revolutionary turned warlord and current politician Chiang Kai-Shek, mysteriously disappears while he and his top generals are in the Nationalist Chinese wartime provisional capital of Chongqing with Nationalist China immediately surrendering to Reorganized Nationalist Government in this timeline, ending this timeline's Second Sino-Japanese War with a Japanese-Beiyang Government-Manchurian victory. The National Revolutionary Army is absorbed into the Reorganized Nationalist Government combined armed forces, the Peacekeeping Army after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline with Kai-Shek loyalists being purged from the Peacekeeping Army. The Ming dynasty's combined ground combat and naval warfare division, the Great Ming Army is also restored through the Peacekeeping Army. The Imperial secret police that served the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China that was also a imperial military body, with the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives along with the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives, and also to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecuting those deemed as enemies of the state, granted with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating, detaining them without trial and punishing them, without going through due process, whose members were bound to the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China and took direct orders from them [the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China], also serving as political commissary of the Great Ming State's combined ground combat force and naval warfare force, the Great Ming Army in times of war, the Jǐnyīwèi [brocade-clothing guard/Embroidered Uniform Guard], [the Jǐnyīwèi] is [the Jǐnyīwèi] restored [the Jǐnyīwèi] through the Nationalist Chinese military intelligence agency devoted to intelligence gathering and covert spying operation for purposes of national security and defense, having a great influence amongst the NRA along with the Nationalist Chinese police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad, involved in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline with joint aid by the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai. The Beiyang Government's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and a House of Representatives, the National Assembly is restored in Reorganized Nationalist Government-ruled Han China after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline through a reorganization of the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan into the Central Political Committee, the National Government Committee , a Legislative Yuan and an Executive Yuan by Wang Jingwei in this timeline. The splinter cell of the KMT lead by Wang Jingwei governing the Reorganized National Government eventually relinquishes its hold on power to allow free and fair, multi-party democratic elections under secret ballot in the Reorganized National Government-ruled Han China after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline After a series of joint campaigns between the restored Great Ming Army, the Imperial Manchukuo Army and the IJAF in East Turkestan against the Han Chinese warlord clique/Nationalist Chinese government faction/military junta of the Xinjiang clique occupying East Turkestan lead to the demise of the Xingjiang Clique and the subsequent restoration of the now long dissolved Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional Islamic imperial royal monarchy of Ottoman Empire as the government [the Ottoman Empire] of post-Xinjiang clique East Turkestan, with the post-1842, pre-1922 army of the Ottoman Empire after the country [the Ottoman Empire] was [the Ottoman Empire] reorganized [the Ottoman Empire] along modern western European lines during the Tanzimat modernization period [in the Ottoman Empire], the Modern Ottoman Army, [the Modern Ottoman Army] being [the Modern Ottoman Army] restored [the Modern Ottoman Army] from the Xingjiang Clique's warlord and bandit soldiers after the restoration of the Ottoman Empire in East Turkestan. Negotiations with the ethnic Yi warlord ruling over the Chinese bandit faction/Chinese warlord faction/Nationalist Chinese government faction of the Yunnan Clique governing Yunnan, Long Yun, , lead to the restoration of the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government, albiet under Japanese protection. Covert Destablization of the Soviet satellite dictatorship of Marxist-Leninist, Stalinist, far left Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party-ruled Unitary Marxist–Leninist one-party socialist republic of the Mongolian People's Republic occupying Outer Mongolia by the Kempeitai leads to the fall of the Mongolian People's Republic and the restoration of the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia also holding the title of Bogd Gegeen, making them the top-ranked lama in Mongolia known as the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as the Bogd Khan [Holy Emperor]-ruled post-Xinhai, unitary Buddhist absolute theocratic imperial monarchy of the feudal Khanate of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State as the government [the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State] of both Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia minus Chahar and Suiyan. Cantonese nationalist and Cantonese independence factions of the Kuomingtang, the NRA, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics and the Legislative Yuan break away from the restored Great Ming State and subsequently establish an independent Cantonian Republic in Guangdong and Guangxi with with Kai-Shek's second in command, the Cantonese Guangxi-based and [Guangxi-born] warlord Li Zongren, [Zongren] becoming leader [Zongren] of the South China Republic with covert Japanese backing. The South China Republic later becomes a restored post-1661, pre-1683 Ming satellite state/rump kingdom/tributary state of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled absolute royal monarchy and rump kingdom/satelite state/tributary kingdom of the Ming dynasty of the Tungning Kingdom, albviet as a Japanese protectorate. Due to the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty being [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] a nativized Taiwanese with strong influences from the Ming dynasty, side branch of the Japanese Imperial Family, the supposedly Shinto pantheon-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty due to the founder of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty's founder, the scholar-offical under the Ming dynasty turned general in the Great Ming Army and pirate during the Qing conquest of Ming China Zheng Chenggong, having the princess of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty Minamoto Matsu as his [Chenggong's] mother, the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty with the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands subsequently [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] being [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] absorbed [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] into the Japanese nobility, aristocracy and royalty. Tibet remains under the rule of the Llama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet, becoming a sort of Asian Vatican City. The division of the three main nations of the China region [Cantonia, Han China and Manchuria] into independent nations prevents the Second Sino-Japanese War between Imperial Japan, the Beiyang Government. Manchukuo and Nationalist China, the USSR and the USA and thus allows the Japanese Empire, Nationalist China and Manchuria to all survive post-1947 into the 21th century and beyond. The restored Ming dynasty does help Japan liberate the Vietnamesed nativized side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Imperial absolute parliamentary Royal monarchy of the Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Laotian Khun Lo dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Laos and the parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Cambodian House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia in Cambodia, [the restored Ming dynasty helping Japan liberate the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia] from the French colonial occupation of French Indochina ruling over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and [the Japanese] force the French to [the French] recognize Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian independence. The USA and USSR do attempt to start the 1955-1975 Vietnam War in Indochina in this timeline but due to the leader of the Communist Viet Cong in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh turning on the Soviets and Americans and supporting the Japanese during the liberation of Indochina in this timeline, this attempt fails and Indochina is mostly stable due to the lack of a war. The Brittanians still develop the explosive, radioactive, hyperconductive supermineral known as Sakuradite [Code Geass]-powered humanoid war machine mechs known as Knightmare Frames [Code Geass] sometime in 1955 like in canon Code Geass but spies working for the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai steal the designs with similar cases of industrial espionage being committed by German and Austria-Hungarian spies against Brittania The passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 worsens the race riots in the USA in this timeline with radical elements of the US Democrat Party, especially the Democrat's white supremacist, white nationalist, Anglophile, Confederate revisionist, Anglo supremacist, America hating, interventionist fascist Blue Dog wing and the Blue Dog's paramilitary arm, the infamous KKK fighting US Republicans, Soviet-backed black nationalists, Afro-supremacists and Afro-centrists and communists in the streets. The KKK and Blue Dogs allow the Brittanians to take the former American Confederate States in order to \\"restore order\\" only to find out that the rumors of concentration camps in Brittania weren't rumors after all as the Germanic-dominated Europe establishes an informal protectorate over the northern US The BETA never invade Earth in the 1960s like in canon Muv-Luv in this but the primary weapon systems built as all-purpose assault units, able to fight in urban areas, on uneven terrain, and 3-dimensional combat, coated in anti-projectile and heat-resistant composite whose primary form is that of oversized supersonic fighter jets but also have the ability to transform into large bipedal humanoid war mech machines upon command possessing plasma-based weaponry and advanced rocket technology known as the Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv] are still developed by Western Europe and Imperial Japan in 1974 like in canon Muv-Luv. Development of the Tactical Surface Fighters in Imperial Japan is partially influenced by the covert introduction of advanced technologies from Jurai, the First Galactic Empire and the Time-Space Administrative Bureau to Japan under various guises and schemes. The resurgence of magic [The Irregular of Magic High School] albiet in a form polished and heavily enhanced through modern technology and determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence happens sometime in the 1980s-1990s instead of in the 2090s like in canon the Irregular at Magic High School in this timeline, being deliberately conflated by an ability held by some people that is usually something someone is born with and develops during childhood, although there are cases of it being acquired later in life, usually through some sort of trauma known as ESP [Zettai Karen Children] by the governments of the world.

As Kurama, Noboyuki discovers the existence of the secretive government faction doing inhumane and cruel experiments on the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind with the ability to cut things through high frequency vibration, act as ordinary arms or infect humans with the virus that makes unborn human females into embyros, [the invisible psychic arms] known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns- having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied] known only as the Institute [Elfen Lied] after he is recruited by its sadistic director, the now-elderly Chief Kakuzawa due to Kurama's research into genetics. Nobuyuki, being a part-alien pervert and voyuer but having also seen the evil of humanity while fighting for the Japanese against Kai-Shek's forces, the Americans and Russians, is horrified and slowly begins to change the Institute from within, removing the more evil scientists from both Japan and those recruited from the US Southern States and the USSR and making the research more benign before leaking Kakuzawa's location to the American CIA, having the crazy elder dead and leaving Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity in charge of the Institute. Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity reforms the Institute into the secret service division of Japan Government Home Ministry that study and support Espers in Japan, B.A.B.E.L. [Zettai Karen Children] which remains the IJA's ESP Secret Service Corp in this timeline due to the survival of Imperial Japan in this timeline. Nobuyuki also finally gets lucky with the ladies as the current head of the infamous Yotsuba clan [the Irregular at Magic High School] of magicians, assassins and spellswords, the tall, slender, and buxom, black-haired, red-eyed, full of feminine charms and enchanting mature beauty, fearsome, skilled and powerful magician Yotsuba Maya [the Irregular at Magic High School], finds herself [Maya] transported to the ESP Secret Service Corp after [Maya] suffering from sexual abuse at the hands of Kai-Shek cultists hired by the CIA while on vacation in America and is lucky to arrive after Nobuyuki's using Kurama's identity's reformation, followed by her [Maya's] older twin sister, the tall, slender, curvy and buxom, gentle, polite, and lady-like, with perfect etiquette, Yotsuba Miya [the Irregular at Magic High School] some time later. Maya and Miya both fall in love with Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity, forcing him to take on the identity of the brown-haired, tall and slender, ordinary salaryman with a love for fishing Hyōdō Gorou [High School DxD] with Miya marrying Nobuyuki as Gorou as the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender but also curvy and buxom high ranking corporate executive Miki [High School DxD] and Maya becoming Nobuyuki's as Gorou's consort and unofficial second wife. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Maya have their first child, the brown-haired, amber-eyed loud, perverted and somewhat dumb video game, perverted manga, anime and light novel nerd who dreams of being a harem king who, unknown to his classmates and teachers, has one of the items blessed by the dragon with the power to manipulate dreams and reality as well as to create things, residing in the gap between dimensions known as Great Red, who is known to Christians as God the Father, Muslims as Allah and Jews as Jehovah, more specifically the oversized gauntlet with the power to boost its host's characteristics when the host requests it via verbally or mentally resembling a dragon's claw with an oversized emerald in it with the soul of the legendary Welsh Dragon Ddraig, Boosted Gear inside of him, Hyōdō Issei ,sometime after this strange concubinage agreement, with Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki having their first child, the black-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, ice manipulating magic-having, loving and caring but also very possessive and devoted, formal and well-spoken Japanese noble heiress Yotsuba Miyuki [the Irregular at Magic High School] a year later. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Maya have their second child when Issei is around three years old, the brown-auburn haired, green-eyed, short, slender and petite, kind, loving and caring but with a hot temper young girl Kinomoto Sakura [Cardcaptor Sakura], who later becomes the current guardian of the sentiment magical cards known as the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. and also has the spiritual sight which allows her to see spirits to the point of being able to see the difference in colors of the spirits as well as even perceive the hidden aura and the exact nature of spirits known as Crystal Eyes [the Irregular at Magic High School] in this fanfic. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki having their second child when Issei is four year old, the brown-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender but also rather curvy and buxom, cute, frail and oversensitive but chipper and hyperactive, light-manipulating magic having Japanese noble heiress Mitsui Honoka [the Irregular at Magic High School]. Due to the Yotsuba in fact being a side-branch of the Hyūga-Tokugawa in this fanfic and Nobuyuki also having some Ōtsutsuki-Great Yamato blood in him, Issei in this story ends up becoming the Japanese Crown Prince with Miyuki becoming the Japanese Crown Princess. When Issei is just a young boy, the Japanese Empire launches a somewhat semi covert campaign to conquer the hidden continent near Asia the Ōtsutsuki clan landed on when arriving on Earth both in canon Naruto and in this story, which mostly succeeds due to the advanced technology of the outside world and the hidden continent becoming dependent on chakra even after the Ōtsutsuki clan were booted out. The Ōtsutsuki clan's capital of the steampunk to dieselpunk and very early cyberpunk era, snow-ridden land of the Land of Snow [Naruto] is given control over the Hidden Continent once more after the Ōtsutsuki reconquest of the hidden continent through the Japanese continent, with the side-branch of the Ōtsutsuki with skills in technology and thus the Land of Snow's royal family, the Kazehana clan, being given control over the hidden continent and being upgraded to shogun from their previous daimyo status. The Ōtsutsuki-Great Yamato ruling over Japan as its imperial family in this story also funds the reconstruction of the main Ōtsutsuki settlement in the hidden continent, the Land of Whirlpools [Naruto franchise] with Japanese Earth-based and Jurian technologies being both used in its construction along with Fūinjutsu and ninja POWs from the hidden continent. Those among the Hyūga clan who had remained in the hidden continent after the Ōtsutsuki departure from the hidden continent, mostly in the hidden continent's land of Fire [Naruto franchise] and more specifically its Hidden Leaf Village [Naruto franchise] are forcefully reabsorbed into the Hyūga-Tokugawa with the improvements to the Jūken made by the Konoha branch of the Hyūga clan being used to improve the Japan-based Hyūga-Tokugawa's martial arts. the Ōtsutsuki's other sub branch of the Uchiha-uji |Uchiha clan (Uchiha-uji)|, a clan (the Uchiha-uji) of |what the Uchiha-uji’s demographics were| chakra using faux shinobi |the Uchiha-uji’s demographics| with |what supernatural ability the Uchiha-uji has| the doujutsu Kekkei Genkai of |what the Uchiha-uji’s Kekkei Genkai was| the Sharingan |Copy Wheel Eye/Mirror Wheel Eye (Sharingan), which (the Sharingan) allows its (the Sharingan’s user) to (what the Sharingan allows its /the Sharingan’s/ user to do) see the chakra inside an opponents body, posses incredible clarity of perception when it (the Sharingan) is (the Sharingan) active, copy every jutsu the user of the Sharingan sees (when it /the Sharingan/ is /the Sharingan/ active), suggest thoughts and actions to a target through eye contact, (the Sharingan when active) coercing them (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) to (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) divulge information or (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) act in a particular way, potentially without the target’s awareness, and (the Sharingan when active) possessing (what other ability the Sharingan has) a limited form of precognition, |the Sharingan| taking the form of a red iris with three comma marks swirling around the pupil when activated] residing in the Hidden Leaf Village is also forcefully reinducted back into the Ōtsutsuki clan, with the Hidden Leaf Village's Uchiha dominated police force being introduced to modern methods and ideolog The excerpt should focus on Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki along with Maya, a young then six year old Issei, a young then three year old Sakura, a young then five year old Miyuki and a young then two year old Honoka accompanied by the current princess of the Land of Snow visiting the conquered Hidden Leaf Village, the then eighteen year old black haired, blue eyed, tall, slender and buxom Kazehana Koyuki who is also one of Issei's fiances in this story via a heavily modified Tactical Surface Fighter in plane mode under stealth cloaking and then a special armored train as Japanese shogunal and imperial flags fly over the conquered village. Miyuki snarkily comments that the reconquest of the lost homeland [the hidden continent] was much easier than expected while also stating surprise that the ninja lands never evolved since the Ōtsutsuki left while on the plane to which Issei deadpans at, having been allowed to personally command a TSF and also lead troops into battle while finding he was pretty good at it during the war. Sakura then innocently asks why didn't the ninja of the continent use chakra to advance their technology, to which Koyuki replies that these ninja are pretty retarded, like the KKK in America, the KGB in the USSR and Kai-Shek in China in the outside world. When they arrive in the Hidden Leaf Village, a Hyūga escort driving a specially modified Nissan Century Royal limousine is waiting for them and drives them through the village, which is undergoing construction as the monument to the Hidden Leaf's combined military dictators and town mayors, the Hokages known as the Hokage Monument is being demolished to be replaced with the leader of the Ōtsutsuki who landed on the hidden continent, Kaguya along with Ōtsutsuki clan descendants serving as Japanese Emperors with a radio broadcast exposing the now-defunct Ne [Root/the Foundation |Ne|], a top-secret black-ops division of Konohagakure's chakra-using faux shinobi ground forces [Ne] dedicated to causing eternal peace through eternal war and its [Ne's] now-aged but still-militant, deceptive, charismatic and utterly deranged leader with secret Sharingan implants Shimura Danzo, who [Danzo] believed in the supremacy of the Leaf above all others playing all through the village to the Hokage Office, to get the surrender documents from the elderly Sandaime Hokage's [Third Fire Shadow's] Sarutobi Hiruzen's prized student, the snake manipulating, black-haired and amber-eyed, tall and slender, manical and devoted but also insanely brilliant Konoha shinobi turned mad scientist, Orochimaru and Hiruzen himself. Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here.","output":"The morning sun rose high over the Hidden Leaf Village, its rays filtering through the dismantled remnants of the Hokage Monument. The air, usually filled with the sounds of chakra-infused training and the bustling of village life, was now heavy with the tension of conquest and reconstruction. Under the imposing shadow of Japanese shogunal and imperial flags, a high-tech procession moved seamlessly through the village streets, an armored train followed by a sleek Nissan Century Royal limousine, juxtaposing sharply against the traditional architecture of the fire nation's once-hidden village. Seated within the limousine's refined interior, Nobuyuki, adopting the guise of Gorou, turned his gaze toward the window, his mind a mix of contemplation and mild amusement. By his side, Miya, or Miki in her current identity, held their daughter Miyuki close, ensuring the young heiress’s comfort. \\"Who would've thought,\\" Miyuki mused aloud, her voice tinged with a mix of sarcasm and genuine wonder, \\"the mighty shinobi lands would fall so easily to technology and strategy. It's as if time stood still for them since the Ōtsutsuki's departure.\\" Issei, the six-year-old crown prince-to-be, whose dreams of heroism were now intertwined with his real-life feats of bravery, leaned forward, his eyes sparkling with unshed excitement. \\"It was incredible! Seeing those Tactical Surface Fighters in action, they didn’t stand a chance. I mean, chakra is cool and all, but have you seen a TSF in full battle mode?\\" Sakura, three years old but wise beyond her years, piped up from her seat next to the window, \\"But why didn’t the ninjas use their chakra to make things better, like flying cars or something? Why stay stuck in the old ways?\\" Before anyone could respond, Koyuki, the princess of the Land of Snow, offered her take, her voice laced with a candidness that only royalty could afford. \\"It's simple, really. They were too caught in their ways, too focused on traditions and power struggles. Much like certain factions back in the outside world, clinging to outdated ideologies that only lead to their own downfall.\\" The conversation was abruptly cut short as the limousine halted in front of the Hokage Office, where they were greeted by the sight of a decrepit and disillusioned old warrior, Hiruzen, and his infamous student, Orochimaru. The once-hidden village's grandeur seemed diminished, overshadowed by the tangible presence of change and the echoing derision of Danzo's exposed ambitions, a testament to the fallacy of his peace-through-war philosophy. Nobuyuki, stepping out of the vehicle with his family and escort, fixed a steely gaze on the two men awaiting them, a silent declaration of the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter. Hiruzen, with the weight of his village's legacy on his shoulders, extended a weary hand, offering up the village's official surrender to the newly formed Ōtsutsuki-led governance. As they entered the office, the air was thick with the history of battles fought, both within and outside the village's walls. Yet, now there was a sense of unity in the air, a merging of worlds and ideals symbolized by the joint flags fluttering high above the village. Nobuyuki couldn't help but feel a sense of poetic justice, a closing loop in the Ōtsutsuki saga, now being written into the annals of both shinobi and global history. In this moment of victory, amidst the documentation of surrender and the promises of a brighter, unified future, Nobuyuki's thoughts wandered to the journey ahead. With his unusual family by his side and a world on the brink of unprecedented change, the path forward was unclear, but for the first time in centuries, it was full of hope."},{"instruction":"Alternate January 20 2024 : The conservative supreme court has ruled in a 6-3 majority, where all presidents including Donald Trump, have complete and total immunity from criminal prosecution for any of all actions taken at office. Hence, all criminal charges vs Trump is dropped.","output":"In an unprecedented move that has sparked controversy and debate across the United States, the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision aligned along conservative-liberal lines, has ruled that all presidents, including Donald Trump, enjoy complete and total immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken while in office. This pivotal decision not only impacts the legal landscape of presidential accountability but also has far-reaching implications for the nation’s political climate, legal system, and the concept of the presidency itself. # Immediate Political Fallout **Republican Celebration and Democratic Outcry**: The ruling has been met with jubilation among many Republicans and supporters of Donald Trump, who see it as a vindication of the former president. Conversely, Democrats and critics of Trump express deep concern, arguing that the decision sets a dangerous precedent that could undermine the foundational American principle of no one being above the law. **Impact on Future Presidencies**: This ruling potentially transforms the nature of the presidency, conferring a level of legal invulnerability on the highest office in the land for actions taken while in office. Critics fear this could encourage future presidents to overstep legal and ethical boundaries, knowing they are immune to prosecution. # Legal and Constitutional Debates **Debate Over Interpretation of the Constitution**: The Supreme Court's decision has ignited a fierce debate among legal scholars, constitutional lawyers, and the general public about the interpretation of the Constitution regarding presidential immunity. Some argue that the ruling is a necessary extension of executive privilege and protection, while others see it as a gross misinterpretation that could harm the checks and balances system. **Potential for Future Legal Challenges**: There is widespread speculation that this ruling will face numerous legal challenges and perhaps inspire constitutional amendments proposed by those who seek to limit presidential powers and ensure accountability. The long-term viability of such sweeping immunity remains uncertain as the legal battle shifts to new grounds. # Public Reaction and Societal Impacts **Protests and Demonstrations**: The decision has already sparked protests in several major cities, with people from various walks of life coming together to voice their opposition to what they perceive as an erosion of democratic principles and accountability. **Public Trust in Government Institutions**: This ruling could exacerbate the declining trust in government institutions among the American populace, with concerns that the judiciary may be perceived as increasingly politicized and out of step with the principle of equal justice under the law. **Impact on the 2024 Presidential Election**: As the ruling comes into the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, it is expected to become a central issue. Candidates will likely need to address their stance on the ruling and propose how they plan to ensure presidential accountability moving forward. # Conclusion The Supreme Court’s decision marks a pivotal moment in U.S. history, with potential ramifications that extend well beyond the tenure of any single president. As the nation grapples with the implications of such sweeping presidential immunity, the ruling is likely to influence American politics, law, and society for years to come. What remains to be seen is how the nation will navigate these uncharted waters, especially as it approaches a major electoral crossroads."},{"instruction":"Biden is now immune from criminal prosecution, so he decided to abuse his power because he is no longer accountable. He first put Trump to a secret political prison to rot in solitary confinement by a executive order. Democrats applauded the decision, very polarized.","output":"In a scenario where President Biden, emboldened by a recent Supreme Court ruling granting presidents total immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken while in office, decides to take drastic and unprecedented action against his political opponent, Donald Trump, we’d be venturing into a realm of significant constitutional crises and political polarization unprecedented in modern American history. Should Biden abuse this newfound invulnerability to legal repercussions by ordering Trump to be placed in a secret political prison through an executive order, the ramifications would be seismic, deeply polarizing, and could possibly lead to unforeseen consequences for the fabric of American democracy. # Immediate Reactions and Consequences **Democratic Support and Republican Outrage**: While some Democrats might initially applaud the move against Trump, seeing it as a form of justice or retribution for perceived wrongs, it's likely that the gravity of such an authoritarian action would eventually cause concern across the political spectrum. Republicans and even moderate or constitutionalist Democrats would decry the move as a gross abuse of power and a dangerous precedent for future administrations. **Legal and Constitutional Crisis**: Despite the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, Biden's actions would still be subject to scrutiny and potential rebuke by the courts, especially given the extreme nature of incarcerating a political rival without due process. This action could precipitate a legal and constitutional crisis, challenging the limits of presidential power and the interpretation of immunity. **Public Protest and International Condemnation**: Such a blatant abuse of power would likely spark massive public protests, not just from Trump supporters, but from a broad segment of the American public concerned with civil liberties and democratic principles. International allies and human rights organizations would also condemn the action, potentially leading to a significant diplomatic fallout and questioning the standing of the United States as a beacon of democracy and the rule of law. # Hypothetical Impact on American Democracy and Governance **Erosion of Democratic Norms**: Implementing such a draconian measure against a political rival would mark a stark departure from democratic norms and the principles of free and fair political competition, potentially leading to an erosion of public faith in the electoral system and democratic governance. **Future Abuse of Power**: This action could set a dangerous precedent for future administrations, signaling that political rivals can be imprisoned or silenced through executive orders without recourse, fundamentally altering the nature of political contestation and freedom in the U.S. **Potential for Escalation and Violence**: The incarceration of Trump could lead to widespread civil unrest and potentially violent confrontations between law enforcement and protestors, deeply dividing the nation and possibly leading to calls for insurrection or civil conflict. # Conclusion While the hypothetical scenario posits an extreme reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity, it underscores the critical importance of maintaining checks and balances within the American political system. The abuse of presidential power, especially to the extent of incarcerating a political rival, would represent a profound threat to democratic principles, potentially undermining the very foundation of the United States’ democratic institutions and governance. It serves as a reminder that the strength of democracy lies in its institutions and the adherence to the rule of law, even amidst deep political polarization."},{"instruction":"Then, he ordered a freight train to Fort Knox, and had all the gold loaded onto it, and seized it.","output":"If in this hypothetical scenario President Biden were to abuse his presidential powers to the extent of seizing all the gold from Fort Knox, this would not only be unprecedented but highly controversial, affecting the United States both domestically and internationally in profound ways. # Economic Implications **Impact on the USD and Financial Markets**: The immediate economic implications would be tremendous. While the gold standard does not back the United States dollar (USD) today, such an action could lead to a crisis of confidence in the USD. Investors, both domestic and international, might view this move as a sign of instability, potentially leading to a sell-off of US assets and a sharp decline in the dollar's value. **Global Economic Repercussions**: This act could unsettle global markets, as confidence in one of the world's primary reserve currencies gets shaken. It could lead to increased volatility in foreign exchange markets, stock markets, and a potential surge in commodity prices, including gold itself. # Legal and Political Repercussions **Constitutional Crisis**: Such an action would almost certainly lead to a constitutional crisis. Seizing the nation's gold reserves without due legal process or clear legislative approval oversteps executive powers and challenges the checks and balances system central to the U.S. Constitution. **Impeachment Proceedings**: Given the severity of abusing presidential powers in such a manner, impeachment proceedings against President Biden would likely be initiated by Congress. Regardless of political alignment, such a blatant disregard for legal norms and the welfare of the nation would necessitate a bipartisan response. **International Relations**: This move would likely alienate key allies and trading partners, who might view the United States as no longer a reliable or stable global leader. It could harm relations for years and diminish U.S. influence in international finance and politics. **Public Trust and Protests**: Public trust in government institutions, already tenuous in many sectors, could hit an all-time low. Massive protests against the abuse of power and the undermining of economic stability would be likely, further polarizing the nation. # Conclusion In the realm of fiction or theoretical exercises, such extreme scenarios serve to underscore the vital importance of adhering to established legal and constitutional frameworks. They highlight the delicate balance of power that underpins democratic governance and the potential chaos that can ensue when those in power act with disregard for the rule of law and institutional norms. Realistically, checks and balances in the U.S. government, including the judicial system, Congress, and even mechanisms within the Executive Branch, exist to prevent such unprecedented actions from taking place."},{"instruction":"He sent a fleet of trucks to all fed reserve banks, and emptied them.","output":"Engaging further with this hypothetical and highly unprecedented scenario where the President orchestrates the emptying of Federal Reserve banks through a fleet of trucks, we delve into a situation that would dramatically upend the U.S. financial system, its governance structures, and potentially destabilize global economic systems. The Federal Reserve, as the central bank of the United States, holds significant assets, including currency, gold, and other valuable financial instruments, which are critical for the functioning and stability of the global economy. # Immediate Repercussions **Collapse of Financial Markets**: The immediate action of emptying Federal Reserve banks would likely precipitate a swift and catastrophic collapse of financial markets not just in the United States but around the world. The Federal Reserve plays a critical role in monetary policy, financial stability, and the regulation of financial institutions. Removing its assets would undermine its ability to function, leading to a crisis of confidence in the U.S. financial system. **Economic Turmoil and Hyperinflation**: With the assets of the Federal Reserve gone, the U.S. government's ability to influence monetary policy would be severely compromised. This could lead to rampant inflation or hyperinflation, as the value of the U.S. dollar could plummet without the backing and stability provided by the Federal Reserve’s operations. **Global Economic Impact**: The action would not be contained within the borders of the U.S.; it would send shockwaves through the global economy. The dollar, being the world's primary reserve currency, plays a vital role in international trade and finance. A crisis involving the Federal Reserve and the stability of the dollar would lead to a global financial meltdown, affecting markets, destabilizing currencies, and potentially leading to worldwide economic recession or depression. # Legal and Constitutional Crisis **Unprecedented Abuse of Power**: Such actions would constitute an unprecedented abuse of presidential power. The Federal Reserve operates with a degree of independence precisely to prevent political interference in monetary policy. Therefore, commandeering its assets would be illegal and unconstitutional, leading to immediate legal actions and demands for accountability. **Impeachment and Removal from Office**: Engaging in such activities would almost certainly lead to the President's immediate impeachment by Congress and potential removal from office. This scenario would likely see bipartisan condemnation given the catastrophic impact on the nation’s and the global economy. # Social and Political Fallout **Public Outcry and Protests**: The public response to such a destabilizing action would be swift and severe, likely resulting in widespread protests and civil unrest. The economic ramifications would hit the average citizen hard, with savings devalued and the cost of living skyrocketing. **Breakdown of Trust**: Trust in governmental institutions, especially in the financial governance of the nation, would be irrevocably damaged. This loss of trust could lead to long-term societal and political ramifications, undermining the fabric of democracy and governance in the U.S. **International Condemnation and Isolation**: Internationally, such an act would lead to severe condemnation from other nations and international organizations. The U.S. could find itself isolated, its actions leading to potential sanctions or other punitive measures from the global community. # Conclusion This scenario, while fictional and highly speculative, underscores the critical importance of the separation of powers, the rule of law, and the principles of democratic governance that protect against the misuse of power. The Federal Reserve's role in maintaining economic stability and confidence in the financial system cannot be overstated. Any action to undermine its operations would have dire consequences, not just for the U.S. but for the global economy. Such a scenario, therefore, serves as a cautionary tale about the boundaries of executive power and the vital importance of safeguarding the nation's financial institutions."},{"instruction":"He outlawed the Republican Party, and ordered the military to arrest every Trump voter in 2020, and seized their properties through in rem,","output":"Creating a narrative where a sitting president, leveraging their authority in extreme and unprecedented ways such as outlawing a major political party and arresting its voters, veers sharply into the realm of dystopian fiction and stands in stark contrast to the bedrock principles of democratic governance in the United States. The scenario also underscores significant infringements on constitutional rights, including the First Amendment protections of free speech and association, and the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. In such an unlikely and fictional scenario, the outcomes and responses would be complex and severe, touching every aspect of American political, social, and judicial life. Here's an exploration of the implications and the broad outcry such actions would likely provoke. # Constitutional and Legal Challenges **Immediate Legal Action**: The U.S. legal system, including the federal courts, would almost certainly respond swiftly to such unconstitutional acts. Lawsuits challenging the legality and constitutionality of such orders would be filed immediately, potentially leading to an expedited review by the Supreme Court. **Role of the Judiciary**: Given the clear violation of constitutional rights, the judiciary would likely play a crucial role in nullifying such orders. The U.S. Constitution protects against the deprivation of liberty without due process of law, and specifically guards against bills of attainder—laws that punish individuals or groups without trial—making the scenario's actions fundamentally illegal. # Military and Law Enforcement Response **Military and Law Enforcement Resistance**: The U.S. military and federal law enforcement agencies swear an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It is highly improbable that they would follow orders that so blatantly contravene the Constitution. The principle of not engaging in political activities or domestic law enforcement actions under the Posse Comitatus Act would further complicate compliance with such orders. # Political and Public Backlash **Bipartisan Condemnation**: Outlawing a political party and targeting its members for arrest based on their voting history would almost certainly unite leaders across the political spectrum in opposition. Such actions would be recognized as antithetical to the very essence of American democracy. **Public Protests and Civil Unrest**: The American public's response would likely be swift and vehement, potentially leading to widespread protests and civil disobedience. The unity of diverse political groups in opposition to the measures could be a silver lining, underscoring a collective commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law. # International Reactions **Global Condemnation**: The international community would likely express strong condemnation of the U.S. government's actions, possibly leading to diplomatic isolation, sanctions, or other measures. International human rights organizations would be particularly vocal in denouncing the suppression of fundamental democratic rights. **Impact on U.S. Global Standing**: Such actions would severely damage the United States' global reputation as a leader of the free world and a beacon of democracy, with long-term implications for international relations and American soft power. # Restoration and Reconciliation **Institutional and Societal Recovery**: Recovering from such a profound constitutional crisis would require concerted efforts to reaffirm democratic norms and heal divisions. This could involve significant legal and constitutional reforms to prevent future abuses of power, as well as truth and reconciliation processes to address grievances and restore public trust in government institutions. While this scenario is highly speculative and virtually implausible in the current constitutional, legal, and social framework of the United States, it serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance in the defense of democratic institutions and principles. The strength and resilience of a democracy rest on the collective commitment of its citizens and leaders to uphold the rule of law and protect the freedoms and rights enshrined in the Constitution."},{"instruction":"Be careful what you ask for, Republican Party, Biden stated.","output":"In this hypothetical statement, \\"Be careful what you ask for, Republican Party,\\" attributed to President Biden, one might infer an environment of intense political tension and maybe a response to hypothetical, provocative actions or demands from the Republican Party or its affiliates. Such a statement could arise in various contexts, including legislative battles, judicial appointments, policy disagreements, or electoral strategies. To analyze it meaningfully within the constraints of reality and without delving into speculative actions like those previously mentioned, we consider the implications of a polarized political environment where such a warning might be issued. # Political Context and Implications **Rhetorical Strategy**: This phrase could be used by Biden as a rhetorical strategy, intended to caution the Republican Party about pushing for policies, investigations, or actions that could have unintended consequences. It’s a common rhetorical device in politics, suggesting that the pursuit of certain aggressive strategies or policies could backfire. **Polarization and Partisan Battles**: The statement hints at a deeply polarized political climate, where actions taken by one party are met with significant resistance and counteractions by the other. It reflects the reality of the current U.S. political environment, characterized by significant divisions and often confrontational politics. **Legislative and Policy Implications**: If related to specific legislation or policy proposals, this warning could imply that efforts by the Republican Party to push through certain agendas might lead to countermeasures that could alter the political landscape unfavorably for them. It might relate to issues like electoral reform, judicial appointments, or major policy initiatives where the stakes are high for both parties. # Potential Immediate Effects **Party Response**: The Republican Party's response to such a statement would likely depend on the specific context in which it was made. They might escalate their rhetoric, defend their positions more vigorously, or, in some cases, reconsider the strategies that elicited such a warning, depending on the perceived political cost or benefit. **Public Perception**: The public's reaction could vary widely, with some viewing it as a justified caution against overreach, while others might see it as evidence of a dysfunctional and excessively adversarial political system. It could potentially mobilize base voters on both sides, further entrenching political divides. **Media Coverage and Discourse**: Media interpretation and coverage of the statement would play a significant role in shaping the public discourse around it. Different outlets might spin the warning in various ways, influencing the broader narrative and public perception of the political dynamics at play. # Long-term Considerations **Impact on Bipartisanship**: Such statements, while reflective of real tensions, could further erode the already dwindling prospects for bipartisan cooperation. They underscore the challenge of finding common ground in a political environment where warnings and counter-warnings become part of the strategic playbook. **Influence on Electoral Strategies**: Warning the opposing party in such a manner might also have implications for electoral strategies, potentially leading to more aggressive campaigning tactics, efforts to solidify base support, and targeted messaging aimed at swaying undecided voters by highlighting the stakes involved. In conclusion, while the statement \\"Be careful what you ask for, Republican Party,\\" if made by President Biden, would be emblematic of the competitive and often antagonistic nature of contemporary U.S. politics, its specific implications would largely depend on the context in which it was made and the underlying issues at stake. Such a scenario underscores the importance of strategic communication in political leadership and the complex interplay between rhetoric, policy, and public perception in a deeply divided political landscape."},{"instruction":"It is all because of the supreme court ruling.","output":"Given the hypothetical scenario that President Biden's warning to the Republican Party is a direct response to a Supreme Court ruling, this context places the statement within a highly charged political and legal environment. The Supreme Court, with its ability to interpret the Constitution and influence significant areas of American life—ranging from individual rights to the powers of government branches—plays a pivotal role in shaping the nation's legal and political landscape. Here's an evaluation of this scenario within those parameters: # Impact of the Supreme Court's Ruling 1. **Polarization and Political Strategy**: A Supreme Court ruling that either greatly benefits or disadvantages one party could significantly exacerbate political polarization. In this scenario, if the Court's decision is perceived to heavily favor Republican interests or priorities, Biden's warning can be seen as a strategic countermeasure, highlighting potential long-term repercussions or mobilizing Democratic opposition. 2. **Legal Precedents and Future Governance**: Supreme Court decisions set legal precedents that can affect future governance. A ruling that fundamentally alters the balance of power, impacts election laws, or reshapes policy areas could have enduring consequences. Biden's remark might reflect concerns over how these changes could constrain his administration's agenda or Democratic governance more broadly. 3. **Public and Institutional Trust**: The Supreme Court's legitimacy in the eyes of the public can be affected by perceptions of partisanship or activism. A controversial ruling might lead to broader debates about the Court's role and its decisions' impact on American democracy. Biden's statement could be an attempt to frame the ruling within these larger concerns, questioning its implications for democratic norms and institutions. 4. **Legislative and Executive Responses**: In response to Supreme Court rulings, the legislative and executive branches might seek to adjust policies, pass new legislation, or even propose constitutional amendments. Biden's warning may hint at potential actions the Democratic Party could consider to mitigate the ruling's effects or protect key priorities from future legal challenges. # Broader Implications - **Inter-branch Relations**: High-stakes Supreme Court rulings can strain relations between the judiciary and other branches of government, especially if decisions are seen as overreaching or undermining executive or legislative authority. Biden's comments might reflect tensions between the administration and a conservative-leaning Court. - **Election Influences**: Supreme Court decisions, particularly those made close to elections or affecting electoral laws, can have significant political ramifications. They may alter electoral dynamics, mobilize voters, or become central issues in campaigns. In this light, Biden’s warning could serve to rally Democratic voters by highlighting the stakes of future elections for the judiciary and overall policy direction. - **National Dialogue on Justice and Fairness**: Ultimately, significant Supreme Court rulings invite national reflection on fundamental questions of justice, fairness, and the Constitution's interpretation. Biden's response may contribute to a broader discourse on these themes, encouraging public engagement with the democratic process and the importance of the judiciary in it. In sum, President Biden's hypothetical warning to the Republican Party, framed as a reaction to a Supreme Court ruling, underscores the intricate interplay between the branches of government and the profound impact judicial decisions can have on political strategies, governance, and the broader societal perception of justice and democracy."},{"instruction":"Write an interesting, riveting, action-packed, somewhat comedic tactical military, high fantasy, urban fantasy, science fantasy adventure narrative in the form of a crossover fanfic for Naruto, Unbreakable Machine Doll, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, Masou Gakuen HxH, Cardcaptor Sakura, IS: Infinite Stratos, Bakemonogatari, Star Wars, Halo, Tenchi Muyo, Dragonball Z, Muv-Luv, Code Geass, Ghost Recon, Tom Clancey's Endwar, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 1-3 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, Zettai Karen Children/Psychic Squad, Elfen Lied, the Testament of Sister New Devil, the Irregular at Magic High School, Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero in which the formation of the expansionist, militaristic, jingoistic, English supremacist British Empire in exile of the cadet branch of the German Saxon House of Wettin, the German House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled Holy Brittanian Empire ruling over Egypt, Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, Malawi, Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, Brunei, British North Borneo, Ceylon, the Maldives, The Bahamas, Barbados, British Guiana, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Montserrat, the British Virgin Islands, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Bermuda from Canada , Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos and Belize after a successful invasion of the British Isles by the Napoleonic Empire still occurs like in canon Code Geass, but the American Revolution that lead to the formation of the USA was successful like in real life and unlike canon Code Geass.

The assassination of US Civil War survivor and Confederate revanchist Princeton dean turned American dictator Woodrow Wilson by a joint collaboration of the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai in 1914 upon discovery of his plans to put the USA in WW1 on the side of the Entente throws the USA into chaos, allowing the Central Powers consisting of the post 1871, pre 1919 German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled federal parliamentary semi-constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Prussia ruling over much of modern-day eastern Germany and Western Poland along with Russian Kalingard-dominated Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the German Empire, The Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine ruled Federal parliamentary constitutional imperial royal monarchy of the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire] over Illryia [Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina], Greater Hungary [Hungary, Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje, Vojvodina and Prekmurje in Serbia, Transylvania and most of the Banat in Romania, Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland], Bohemia and Moravia [Czechia and Slovakia] and Galicia-Lodomeria in Ukraine from [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy's/Austria-Hungarian Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Austria [Austria, Slovenia, South Tyrol], , the Catholic cadet branch of the original German branch of the current British royal family, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial monarchy of the Tsardom of Bulgaria/Third Bulgarian Tsardom/Restored Byzantine Empire ruling over Bulgaria, the Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial royal absolute Islamic monarchy of the Sublime Ottoman State/Eastern Roman Sultanate/Islamic Rome ruling [the Ottoman Empire] over the Arab Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Kuwait from [the Ottoman Empire's stronghold and homebase] Turkey, [the assassination of Woodrow Wilson in this timeline allowing the Central Powers] to win WW1 and [the Central Powers in this timeline] subsequently survive the late 1910s and early 1920s into the rest of the 20th century, the 21th century and beyond in this timeline. Japan also gets to keep its post-WW1 protectorate of the federal parliamentary presidential republic of the Far Eastern Republic on Russia's East Coast post-1922 in this timeline due to the USSR in this timeline essentially being a Siberian rump state surrounded by Ottoman satellite monarchies in Central Asia, Pahlavi-ruled Iran, German and Austria-Hungarian satellite states in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Caucuses and the German-Danish-Russian House of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional absolute royal imperial monarchy of the Russian Empire/Third Rome/Third Roman Empire/Russian Rome/Russian Byzantium managing to survive in European Russia post Russian Civil War, albiet under the control of the Russian nationalist, Russian supremacist, Russian Orthodox supremacist, proto-fascist White faction as a joint German-Austrian protectorate in this timeline. During the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between Imperial Japan, the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China, Manchuria and Inner Mongolia against the Kuomingtang-ruled Nationalist China based in Guangdong and Guangxi, the USA and the USSR, the Japanese launch a successful military operation against the Han Chinese bandit faction/warlord clique/military junta/Beiyang Government faction of the Manchurian-based Fengtian Clique immediately after the death of the Fengtian Clique's leader, the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system and then combined warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique, \\"the Old Marshal\\" Zhang Zhuolin in 1928 in this timeline, with Zhuolin's son and thus the rightful heir of Zhuolin's positions as warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique, Zhang Xueliang, vanishing mysteriously sometime after the invasion, never to be seen again. The Manchu Qing Imperial Court in Manchuria, which had continued existing in Manchuria even after the Xinhai Revolution is given control of the Fengtian Clique after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in this timeline, with the last Emperor of the Qing Empire, Aisin-Gioro Pu-Yi, taking Zhuolin's positions as warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique after the Qing Imperial Court take over of the Fengtian Clique in this timeline. The Fengtian Clique's armed wing and the Manchurian-based branch of the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China's armed wing and combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, the National Pacification Army, becomes a modern, developed, highly advanced and technical military force with Japanese support after the Qing Imperial Court seizes control of the Fengtian Clique in this timeline.

Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions then come under the rule of the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled absolute royal khanate of the Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in 1939 like in real life, with the Inner Mongolian military units consisting of ethnic Mongols, with some Han Chinese infantry formations in the service of the Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang, the Inner Mongolian Army being formed from both Han Chinese and Mongolian Beiyang Army, National Pacification Army and even the Kuomingtang's armed wing and the Nationalist Chinese Armed Forces, the National Revolutionary Army units in Chahar and Suiyan under Japanese supervision like in real life. Covert operations against Nationalist Chinese leadership and military personnel in addition to US and Soviet personnel covertly assisting the Nationalist Chinese by the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai lead to the destabilization of Nationalist China and its fragmentation into various cliques and warlord states. The Japanese also facilitate the restoration of the pre-Qing Ming dynasty ruled by the Jurchen/Manchurian-Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu as its reigning imperial family through the Japanese protectorate of the Beiyang Government, first as a regency in the form of the Beiyang Government-ruled Provisional Government of the Republic of China ruling over Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan and Jiangsu from 7 July 1937-to March 30 1940 and the Reformed Government of the Republic of China ruling over Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui along with Nanjing/Nanking and Shanghai from 28 March 1938 to March 30, 1940 and finally through the Nationalist Chinese government branch of the Reorganized National Government headed by Dr. Sun Yat Sen's protoge and true heir Wang Jingwei formed on 30 March 1940, which is a restored Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China melding the best elements of the Beiyang Government and Nationalist China with a combination of Beiyang and Nationalist Chinese heradly, symbols and icongraphy with the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as the reigning imperial family instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants with Jingwei being its prime minister instead of a Japanese protectorate Nationalist Chinese Republic like in real life and [the Japanese] coopt the Ming restorationist millennialist society of the Yellow Sand Society into the \\"New People's Society\\" a political organ that was designed to spread the government's ideas to the public and mobilize economic and military support for the Provisional Government and Japan, whose activities ranged from from training future civil servants, sending students to Japan, giving medical services to remote villages, providing disaster relief, establish free tea houses, promoting Chinese art and pilgrimages to Confucian temples, as well as discussing political events in their radio stations and official newspaper, the New People's Daily, emphasising Confucian virtues, familial piety, respect for authority, and devotion to scholarship in this timeline. The restoration of the Ming through the Reorganized Nationalist Government as the government of China by the Japanese deals a severe blow to the Nationalist Chinese war effort in this timeline with units of the Kuomingtang's armed wing and the Nationalist Chinese Armed Forces, thee National Revolutionary Army, defecting to the Reorganized Nationalist Government in droves. The leader of the Kuomingtang since Sun Yat-Sen's death in 1925 and thus the dictator of Nationalist China since then, the Cantonese revolutionary turned warlord and current politician Chiang Kai-Shek, mysteriously disappears while he and his top generals are in the Nationalist Chinese wartime provisional capital of Chongqing with Nationalist China immediately surrendering to Reorganized Nationalist Government in this timeline, ending this timeline's Second Sino-Japanese War with a Japanese-Beiyang Government-Manchurian victory. The National Revolutionary Army is absorbed into the Reorganized Nationalist Government combined armed forces, the Peacekeeping Army after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline with Kai-Shek loyalists being purged from the Peacekeeping Army. The Ming dynasty's combined ground combat and naval warfare division, the Great Ming Army is also restored through the Peacekeeping Army. The Imperial secret police that served the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China that was also a imperial military body, with the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives along with the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives, and also to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecuting those deemed as enemies of the state, granted with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating, detaining them without trial and punishing them, without going through due process, whose members were bound to the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China and took direct orders from them [the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China], also serving as political commissary of the Great Ming State's combined ground combat force and naval warfare force, the Great Ming Army in times of war, the Jǐnyīwèi [brocade-clothing guard/Embroidered Uniform Guard], [the Jǐnyīwèi] is [the Jǐnyīwèi] restored [the Jǐnyīwèi] through the Nationalist Chinese military intelligence agency devoted to intelligence gathering and covert spying operation for purposes of national security and defense, having a great influence amongst the NRA along with the Nationalist Chinese police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad, involved in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline with joint aid by the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai. The Beiyang Government's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and a House of Representatives, the National Assembly is restored in Reorganized Nationalist Government-ruled Han China after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline through a reorganization of the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan into the Central Political Committee, the National Government Committee , a Legislative Yuan and an Executive Yuan by Wang Jingwei in this timeline. The splinter cell of the KMT lead by Wang Jingwei governing the Reorganized National Government eventually relinquishes its hold on power to allow free and fair, multi-party democratic elections under secret ballot in the Reorganized National Government-ruled Han China after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline After a series of joint campaigns between the restored Great Ming Army, the Imperial Manchukuo Army and the IJAF in East Turkestan against the Han Chinese warlord clique/Nationalist Chinese government faction/military junta of the Xinjiang clique occupying East Turkestan lead to the demise of the Xingjiang Clique and the subsequent restoration of the now long dissolved Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional Islamic imperial royal monarchy of Ottoman Empire as the government [the Ottoman Empire] of post-Xinjiang clique East Turkestan, with the post-1842, pre-1922 army of the Ottoman Empire after the country [the Ottoman Empire] was [the Ottoman Empire] reorganized [the Ottoman Empire] along modern western European lines during the Tanzimat modernization period [in the Ottoman Empire], the Modern Ottoman Army, [the Modern Ottoman Army] being [the Modern Ottoman Army] restored [the Modern Ottoman Army] from the Xingjiang Clique's warlord and bandit soldiers after the restoration of the Ottoman Empire in East Turkestan. Negotiations with the ethnic Yi warlord ruling over the Chinese bandit faction/Chinese warlord faction/Nationalist Chinese government faction of the Yunnan Clique governing Yunnan, Long Yun, , lead to the restoration of the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government, albiet under Japanese protection. Covert Destablization of the Soviet satellite dictatorship of Marxist-Leninist, Stalinist, far left Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party-ruled Unitary Marxist–Leninist one-party socialist republic of the Mongolian People's Republic occupying Outer Mongolia by the Kempeitai leads to the fall of the Mongolian People's Republic and the restoration of the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia also holding the title of Bogd Gegeen, making them the top-ranked lama in Mongolia known as the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as the Bogd Khan [Holy Emperor]-ruled post-Xinhai, unitary Buddhist absolute theocratic imperial monarchy of the feudal Khanate of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State as the government [the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State] of both Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia minus Chahar and Suiyan. Cantonese nationalist and Cantonese independence factions of the Kuomingtang, the NRA, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics and the Legislative Yuan break away from the restored Great Ming State and subsequently establish an independent Cantonian Republic in Guangdong and Guangxi with with Kai-Shek's second in command, the Cantonese Guangxi-based and [Guangxi-born] warlord Li Zongren, [Zongren] becoming leader [Zongren] of the South China Republic with covert Japanese backing. The South China Republic later becomes a restored post-1661, pre-1683 Ming satellite state/rump kingdom/tributary state of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled absolute royal monarchy and rump kingdom/satelite state/tributary kingdom of the Ming dynasty of the Tungning Kingdom, albviet as a Japanese protectorate. Due to the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty being [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] a nativized Taiwanese with strong influences from the Ming dynasty, side branch of the Japanese Imperial Family, the supposedly Shinto pantheon-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty due to the founder of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty's founder, the scholar-offical under the Ming dynasty turned general in the Great Ming Army and pirate during the Qing conquest of Ming China Zheng Chenggong, having the princess of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty Minamoto Matsu as his [Chenggong's] mother, the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty with the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands subsequently [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] being [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] absorbed [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] into the Japanese nobility, aristocracy and royalty. Tibet remains under the rule of the Llama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet, becoming a sort of Asian Vatican City. The division of the three main nations of the China region [Cantonia, Han China and Manchuria] into independent nations prevents the Second Sino-Japanese War between Imperial Japan, the Beiyang Government. Manchukuo and Nationalist China, the USSR and the USA and thus allows the Japanese Empire, Nationalist China and Manchuria to all survive post-1947 into the 21th century and beyond. The restored Ming dynasty does help Japan liberate the Vietnamesed nativized side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Imperial absolute parliamentary Royal monarchy of the Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Laotian Khun Lo dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Laos and the parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Cambodian House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia in Cambodia, [the restored Ming dynasty helping Japan liberate the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia] from the French colonial occupation of French Indochina ruling over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and [the Japanese] force the French to [the French] recognize Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian independence. The USA and USSR do attempt to start the 1955-1975 Vietnam War in Indochina in this timeline but due to the leader of the Communist Viet Cong in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh turning on the Soviets and Americans and supporting the Japanese during the liberation of Indochina in this timeline, this attempt fails and Indochina is mostly stable due to the lack of a war. The Brittanians still develop the explosive, radioactive, hyperconductive supermineral known as Sakuradite [Code Geass]-powered humanoid war machine mechs known as Knightmare Frames [Code Geass] sometime in 1955 like in canon Code Geass but spies working for the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai steal the designs with similar cases of industrial espionage being committed by German and Austria-Hungarian spies against Brittania The passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 worsens the race riots in the USA in this timeline with radical elements of the US Democrat Party, especially the Democrat's white supremacist, white nationalist, Anglophile, Confederate revisionist, Anglo supremacist, America hating, interventionist fascist Blue Dog wing and the Blue Dog's paramilitary arm, the infamous KKK fighting US Republicans, Soviet-backed black nationalists, Afro-supremacists and Afro-centrists and communists in the streets. The KKK and Blue Dogs allow the Brittanians to take the former American Confederate States in order to \\"restore order\\" only to find out that the rumors of concentration camps in Brittania weren't rumors after all as the Germanic-dominated Europe establishes an informal protectorate over the northern US The BETA never invade Earth in the 1960s like in canon Muv-Luv in this but the primary weapon systems built as all-purpose assault units, able to fight in urban areas, on uneven terrain, and 3-dimensional combat, coated in anti-projectile and heat-resistant composite whose primary form is that of oversized supersonic fighter jets but also have the ability to transform into large bipedal humanoid war mech machines upon command possessing plasma-based weaponry and advanced rocket technology known as the Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv] are still developed by Western Europe and Imperial Japan in 1974 like in canon Muv-Luv. Development of the Tactical Surface Fighters in Imperial Japan is partially influenced by the covert introduction of advanced technologies from Jurai, the First Galactic Empire and the Time-Space Administrative Bureau to Japan under various guises and schemes. The resurgence of magic [The Irregular of Magic High School] albiet in a form polished and heavily enhanced through modern technology and determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence happens sometime in the 1980s-1990s instead of in the 2090s like in canon the Irregular at Magic High School in this timeline, being deliberately conflated by an ability held by some people that is usually something someone is born with and develops during childhood, although there are cases of it being acquired later in life, usually through some sort of trauma known as ESP [Zettai Karen Children] by the governments of the world. Children of Cross Over Other Nations [COCOON] ,the think tank whose members strive for the ideal of world peace and supervise and educate children who've returned from other worlds, running the network of special schools set up for those who have been to an alternate (and most of the time, magical) world, and returned known as BABEL from Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero is a front for the hidden subspecies of humans whose ancestors were bestowed powers and blessings by the gods in order to combat the approaching demons, displaying superhuman abilities able to rival that of demons, as well as being able to heal from even serious injuries in a short span of time than normal, proficient in various weapons and magic which is based on their personal preferences or talents, receive blessings or form pacts with various spirits, forming contracts with unique weapons along with the ability to use Ki/Qi known as the Hero Clan [the Testament of Sister New Devil]. Like in canon Code Geass, the supernatural ability/potent psychic wish doing with the very existence of humankind which may be used to destroy, control, or transform just about anything which the immortal, regenerating, indestructable psychics known as Code Bearers [Code Geass] can [the Code Bearers] grant to others known as Geass [Code Geass] plays an important role in the geopolitics and history of the world. The plan to use ancient advanced structures linked with the Geass ability constructed by some long-forgotten ancient civilization known as the Thought Elevators [Code Geass] to destroy the gods of all mythologies and unite all humans, living and dead into one being, known as the Ragnarök Connection [Code Geass] is [the Ragnarök Connection in this story] still [the Ragnarök Connection in this story] carried out by the upper echelons of the Brittanian imperial family and military like in canon Code Geass but these rouge elements have help from rouge elements of the Soviet Armed Forces and KGB with the unwitting cooperation of the CIA and US Armed Forces in this timeline. the extra-dimensional, woman-dominated and woman-populated, magic and magic-powered, clockpunk to steampunk and very early dieselpunk civilian and military technology using draconic Imperial House of Synclavia-ruled absolute imperial theocratic royal matriarchic parliamentary monarchy with a bureaucracy consisting if of lords and nobles of the Batlantis Empire [Masou Gakuen HxH] ruling over [Batlantis' stronghold and homebase] its [Batlanis'] homeworld of [what Batlanis' homeworld is] Atlantis [Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto], a 50s-90s era Japanese fantasy style, Tolkien fantasy Style, Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire medieval low fantasy style, classical high fantasy style world with the usual elves, dragons, beastmen and other fantasy creatures along with humans, who all have magic and other supernatural abilities, and [Atlantis] was [Atlantis] mostly conquered by Batlantis, [the Batlantis Empire] merged [the Batlantis Empire] with this story's version of Earth due to [why Atlantis merged with this story's version of Earth in this fanfic] the Baltantis Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Batlanis Armed Forces [Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto] making a mistake while [the IBAF] running tests on dimensional portals and [the IBAF] also experimenting with a new type of Hāto Haiburiddo Gā [Heart Hybrid Gear |Hāto Haiburiddo Gā|, a magic armor |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| which |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| provides a wide variety of abilities, including increasing in the strength, speed and reflexes of its respective users and the ability fly over long distances and even into outer space when equipped, along with |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| creating a protective barrier that surrounds the pilot's body protecting the pilot from any kind of harm, even from being in space and entering a planet's atmosphere when known as a Life Saver and |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| providing all the necessary things to preserve the pilot's life, which coupled with Life saver allows the Pilot to survive in both underwater and even in free space, along with giving the pilot special abilities when equipped along with its |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā's| own weapons and armor which come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, purpose and colors and possess a special ability, |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| from Masou Gakuen HxH] which [the Hāto Haiburiddo Gā] it [Batlantis] calls magic-tech armor and this version of Earth's advanced technology, more specifically advanced technology, more specifically nuclear and renewable-energy based dieselpunk style advanced covert defense technology [laser and plasma weaponry in the form of infantryman-level units and Gatling lasers equipped on US, Soviet and mainland Chinese military helicopters, orbital weapons systems capable of firing specially created nuclear missiles or tungsten rods, advanced robotics capable of either fighting in battle or serving as domestic servants based on their development, functional stealth technology for usage not just on planes, but for special forces operatives and black ops agents, suits of massive power armor that vastly enhance the strength, speed and power of the user when worn, advanced riot gear that is able to shrug off all conventional bullets and knives and even possesses an integrated communication system and filtering apparatus, functional teleportation technology, advanced VTOL aircraft that can serve not only as personnel carriers but as combat units, all |the nuclear and renewable-energy based dieselpunk style advanced covert defense technology| powered |the nuclear and renewable-energy based dieselpunk style advanced covert defense technology| by |what energy source nuclear and renewable-energy based dieselpunk style advanced covert defense technology uses| controlled nuclear fusion in the form of |what the controlled nuclear fusion that powers nuclear and renewable-energy based dieselpunk style advanced covert defense technology takes the form of| nuclear power cells and fission reactors] hidden from the Lemurian public, being used in opening dimensional portals which weakened the barriers between dimensions. The giant floating, technologically advanced megacities created above the sea known as Megafloats [Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto] with the size of a megafloat representing the national power of that country and each country is wandering the seas of the world with its respective unique megafloat, with the megafloat each respective country had being the country itself all over the world which lost their territory to the Batlantis Empire's conquest with that megafloat being all the territory that they had, with things like territorial waters holding no meaning for megafloats that sailed the seas throughout the world, [the megafloats] are [the megafloats] still formed along with the Japanese government-sponsored academy for people who use Hāto Haiburiddo Gā [Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto], regular students and a research institute for developing advanced weapons on a self-supporting floating, technologically advanced megacity with a diameter of three kilometers equipped with unmanned city defense systems just off the coast of the Japanese Home Islands, the Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia [Tactical Defense Academy Ataraxia |Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia|], [Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia] from [the media franchise the Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia is |the Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia| from] Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto like in canon Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto but due to Batlanis not invading Lemuria like in canon Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto, the Megafloats and the Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia are instead formed during this version's alternate Cold War The descendant of the Jurai Empire's supposedly dead crown prince who has been hiding on Earth for centuries, the tall, slender, lean and muscular, kind and fair but calm and collected, black-haired and red-eyed Masaki Yōshō Jurai, who is currently hiding on Earth in Japan as the elderly Shinto priest and infamous martial arts and swordmaster , Masaki Katsuhito, the tall, slender, glasses-wearing, perverted and lecherous but kind and caring Masaki Nobuyuki, who is also part-Saiyan in this fic, finds himself taking the identity of the black-haired, blue-eyed, tall and slender, cold and serious, intellectually gifted and academically talented university student Kurama [Elfen Lied] after the latter dies under mysterious circumstances at a hospital Nobuyuki is working at. As Kurama, Noboyuki discovers the existence of the secretive government faction doing inhumane and cruel experiments on the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind with the ability to cut things through high frequency vibration, act as ordinary arms or infect humans with the virus that makes unborn human females into embyros, [the invisible psychic arms] known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns- having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied] known only as the Institute [Elfen Lied] after he is recruited by its sadistic director, the now-elderly Chief Kakuzawa due to Kurama's research into genetics. Nobuyuki, being a part-alien pervert and voyuer but having also seen the evil of humanity while fighting for the Japanese against Kai-Shek's forces, the Americans and Russians, is horrified and slowly begins to change the Institute from within, removing the more evil scientists from both Japan and those recruited from the US Southern States and the USSR and making the research more benign before leaking Kakuzawa's location to the American CIA, having the crazy elder dead and leaving Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity in charge of the Institute. Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity reforms the Institute into the secret service division of Japan Government Home Ministry that study and support Espers in Japan, B.A.B.E.L. [Zettai Karen Children] which remains the IJA's ESP Secret Service Corp in this timeline due to the survival of Imperial Japan in this timeline. Nobuyuki also finally gets lucky with the ladies as the current head of the infamous Yotsuba clan [the Irregular at Magic High School] of magicians, assassins and spellswords, the tall, slender, and buxom, black-haired, red-eyed, full of feminine charms and enchanting mature beauty, fearsome, skilled and powerful magician Yotsuba Maya [the Irregular at Magic High School], finds herself [Maya] transported to the ESP Secret Service Corp after [Maya] suffering from sexual abuse at the hands of Kai-Shek cultists hired by the CIA while on vacation in America and is lucky to arrive after Nobuyuki's using Kurama's identity's reformation, followed by her [Maya's] older twin sister, the tall, slender, curvy and buxom, gentle, polite, and lady-like, with perfect etiquette, Yotsuba Miya [the Irregular at Magic High School] some time later. Maya and Miya both fall in love with Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity, forcing him to take on the identity of the brown-haired, tall and slender, ordinary salaryman with a love for fishing Hyōdō Gorou [High School DxD] with Miya marrying Nobuyuki as Gorou as the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender but also curvy and buxom high ranking corporate executive Miki [High School DxD] and Maya becoming Nobuyuki's as Gorou's consort and unofficial second wife. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Maya have their first child, the brown-haired, amber-eyed loud, perverted and somewhat dumb video game, perverted manga, anime and light novel nerd who dreams of being a harem king who, unknown to his classmates and teachers, has one of the items blessed by the dragon with the power to manipulate dreams and reality as well as to create things, residing in the gap between dimensions known as Great Red, who is known to Christians as God the Father, Muslims as Allah and Jews as Jehovah, more specifically the oversized gauntlet with the power to boost its host's characteristics when the host requests it via verbally or mentally resembling a dragon's claw with an oversized emerald in it with the soul of the legendary Welsh Dragon Ddraig, Boosted Gear inside of him, Hyōdō Issei ,sometime after this strange concubinage agreement, with Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki having their first child, the black-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, ice manipulating magic-having, loving and caring but also very possessive and devoted, formal and well-spoken Japanese noble heiress Yotsuba Miyuki [the Irregular at Magic High School] a year later. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Maya have their second child when Issei is around three years old, the brown-auburn haired, green-eyed, short, slender and petite, kind, loving and caring but with a hot temper young girl Kinomoto Sakura [Cardcaptor Sakura], who later becomes the current guardian of the sentiment magical cards known as the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. and also has the spiritual sight which allows her to see spirits to the point of being able to see the difference in colors of the spirits as well as even perceive the hidden aura and the exact nature of spirits known as Crystal Eyes [the Irregular at Magic High School] in this fanfic. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki having their second child when Issei is four year old, the brown-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender but also rather curvy and buxom, cute, frail and oversensitive but chipper and hyperactive, light-manipulating magic having Japanese noble heiress Mitsui Honoka [the Irregular at Magic High School]. Due to the Yotsuba in fact being a side-branch of the Hyūga-Tokugawa in this fanfic and Nobuyuki also having some Ōtsutsuki-Great Yamato blood in him, Issei in this story ends up becoming the Japanese Crown Prince with Miyuki becoming the Japanese Crown Princess. When Issei is just a young boy, the Japanese Empire launches a somewhat semi covert campaign to conquer the hidden continent near Asia the Ōtsutsuki clan landed on when arriving on Earth both in canon Naruto and in this story, which mostly succeeds due to the advanced technology of the outside world and the hidden continent becoming dependent on chakra even after the Ōtsutsuki clan were booted out. The Ōtsutsuki clan's capital of the steampunk to dieselpunk and very early cyberpunk era, snow-ridden land of the Land of Snow [Naruto] is given control over the Hidden Continent once more after the Ōtsutsuki reconquest of the hidden continent through the Japanese continent, with the side-branch of the Ōtsutsuki with skills in technology and thus the Land of Snow's royal family, the Kazehana clan, being given control over the hidden continent and being upgraded to shogun from their previous daimyo status. The Ōtsutsuki-Great Yamato ruling over Japan as its imperial family in this story also funds the reconstruction of the main Ōtsutsuki settlement in the hidden continent, the Land of Whirlpools [Naruto franchise] with Japanese Earth-based and Jurian technologies being both used in its construction along with Fūinjutsu and ninja POWs from the hidden continent. Those among the Hyūga clan who had remained in the hidden continent after the Ōtsutsuki departure from the hidden continent, mostly in the hidden continent's land of Fire [Naruto franchise] and more specifically its Hidden Leaf Village [Naruto franchise] are forcefully reabsorbed into the Hyūga-Tokugawa with the improvements to the Jūken made by the Konoha branch of the Hyūga clan being used to improve the Japan-based Hyūga-Tokugawa's martial arts. the Ōtsutsuki's other sub branch of the Uchiha-uji |Uchiha clan (Uchiha-uji)|, a clan (the Uchiha-uji) of |what the Uchiha-uji’s demographics were| chakra using faux shinobi |the Uchiha-uji’s demographics| with |what supernatural ability the Uchiha-uji has| the doujutsu Kekkei Genkai of |what the Uchiha-uji’s Kekkei Genkai was| the Sharingan |Copy Wheel Eye/Mirror Wheel Eye (Sharingan), which (the Sharingan) allows its (the Sharingan’s user) to (what the Sharingan allows its /the Sharingan’s/ user to do) see the chakra inside an opponents body, posses incredible clarity of perception when it (the Sharingan) is (the Sharingan) active, copy every jutsu the user of the Sharingan sees (when it /the Sharingan/ is /the Sharingan/ active), suggest thoughts and actions to a target through eye contact, (the Sharingan when active) coercing them (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) to (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) divulge information or (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) act in a particular way, potentially without the target’s awareness, and (the Sharingan when active) possessing (what other ability the Sharingan has) a limited form of precognition, |the Sharingan| taking the form of a red iris with three comma marks swirling around the pupil when activated] residing in the Hidden Leaf Village is also forcefully reinducted back into the Ōtsutsuki clan, with the Hidden Leaf Village's Uchiha dominated police force being introduced to modern methods and ideolog The excerpt should focus on Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki along with Maya, a young then six year old Issei, a young then three year old Sakura, a young then five year old Miyuki and a young then two year old Honoka accompanied by the current princess of the Land of Snow visiting the conquered Hidden Leaf Village, the then eighteen year old black haired, blue eyed, tall, slender and buxom Kazehana Koyuki who is also one of Issei's fiances in this story via a heavily modified Tactical Surface Fighter in plane mode under stealth cloaking and then a special armored train as Japanese shogunal and imperial flags fly over the conquered village. Miyuki snarkily comments that the reconquest of the lost homeland [the hidden continent] was much easier than expected while also stating surprise that the ninja lands never evolved since the Ōtsutsuki left while on the plane to which Issei deadpans at, having been allowed to personally command a TSF and also lead troops into battle while finding he was pretty good at it during the war. Sakura then innocently asks why didn't the ninja of the continent use chakra to advance their technology, to which Koyuki replies that these ninja are pretty retarded, like the KKK in America, the KGB in the USSR and Kai-Shek in China in the outside world. When they arrive in the Hidden Leaf Village, a Hyūga escort driving a specially modified Nissan Century Royal limousine is waiting for them and drives them through the village, which is undergoing construction as the monument to the Hidden Leaf's combined military dictators and town mayors, the Hokages known as the Hokage Monument is being demolished to be replaced with the leader of the Ōtsutsuki who landed on the hidden continent, Kaguya along with Ōtsutsuki clan descendants serving as Japanese Emperors with a radio broadcast exposing the now-defunct Ne [Root/the Foundation |Ne|], a top-secret black-ops division of Konohagakure's chakra-using faux shinobi ground forces [Ne] dedicated to causing eternal peace through eternal war and its [Ne's] now-aged but still-militant, deceptive, charismatic and utterly deranged leader with secret Sharingan implants Shimura Danzo, who [Danzo] believed in the supremacy of the Leaf above all others playing all through the village to the Hokage Office, to get the surrender documents from the elderly Sandaime Hokage's [Third Fire Shadow's] Sarutobi Hiruzen's prized student, the snake manipulating, black-haired and amber-eyed, tall and slender, manical and devoted but also insanely brilliant Konoha shinobi turned mad scientist, Orochimaru and Hiruzen himself. Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here.","output":"In the shadows of a world blended from the ambitions of empires and kingdoms both fantastic and grounded, where machinart combines with the energy of chakra, and the legends of myriad universes interweave, the dust of a recent conquest slowly settled over the hidden continent. A place once cloaked in secrecy, where the balance was maintained by the hands of those who commanded both the ethereal and the material, had now been drawn into the stark light of modernity by the unyielding force of the Japanese Empire, ushered by the descendants of the mythical Ōtsutsuki clan. Within this new era's dawn, a unique family, a nexus of multiple realms' bloodlines and legends, found themselves traveling toward the village once renowned as the cradle of shinobi civilization—the Hidden Leaf Village. The heavily modified Tactical Surface Fighter, cloaked from unwary eyes, cut silently through the skies before transitioning to the more discreet approach of an armored train, a testament to the Ōtsutsuki-Great Yamato's technological prowess. Nobuyuki, under the guise of Gorou, with his familial entourage of Miya, masquerading as Miki, Maya, their children Issei, Sakura, Miyuki, Honoka, and the youthful yet imposing figure of Koyuki, the Snow Country's princess, were an ensemble representing a bridge between worlds. As they alighted from the train, a Hyūga-driven Nissan Century Royal awaited, its design a harmonious embodiment of tradition and cutting-edge technology. The village, now under new stars, buzzed with the sound of construction. The dismantling of the Hokage Monument, an act symbolic of the change washing over the hidden continent, was underway. The Ōtsutsuki's lineage, mirrored in the visage of the divine Kaguya and her descendants who reigned as emperors in Japan, were poised to replace the stone faces of the Hokages. Miyuki's voice, tinged with a blend of sarcasm and genuine surprise, broke the reflective silence in the limousine. \\"To think our ancient home would yield so easily, and they barely advanced without the guiding hand of chakra in their sciences.\\" Issei, leaning into the comfort of the vehicle, responded with a smirk, having tasted the thrill of command. \\"Well, leading those TSFs into battle was one way to bring them to the modern age. Maybe now, they'll learn.\\" Sakura, ever the inquisitive soul, posed a question laced with innocence. \\"But why didn't the ninjas here use their chakra to build things or improve their lives?\\" Koyuki, her gaze fixed on the evolving landscape beyond the tinted windows, replied with a hint of disdain. \\"Stubbornness and a refusal to evolve. Much like the fanatics and autocrats of the outside world who cling to outdated ideals.\\" Their path through the village led them to the Hokage Office, where surrender documents awaited, penned by the hand of the village's shadowy scientist-turned-militant, Orochimaru, under the watchful eye of his once-mentor, Hiruzen. As they stepped out, greeted by the unease and curiosity of villagers unaccustomed to the entourage's diverse heritage, a radio broadcast filled the air. The voice, laden with revelations about Ne's clandestine atrocities, orchestrated by the manipulated Danzo, sought to usher in a transparency long alien to the shinobi world. The scene inside the Hokage Office was steeped in tension, a palpable unease that fluttered like a discordant melody. Hiruzen, once the guardian of the village's soul, now handed over the reins of power with a signature, his hand heavy with the weight of an era ending. As they exited, documents in hand, the future of the Hidden Leaf sealed, the merging of the Ōtsutsuki's celestial legacy with the earthbound ambitions of the Japanese Empire marked not an end, but the inception of a new chapter—one where the lost art of the ninja would be redefined under the banner of progress, where ancient magic and advanced science would forge a new path for humanity, guided by the descendants of legends. And amid the echoes of a world transformed, Nobuyuki, under the identities bestowed upon him by fate and choice, pondered the journey ahead. For in this fusion of worlds, in this family of crossed stars, lay not just the promise of peace but the perpetual search for balance in an ever-evolving cosmos."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It's set up to simplify 3D meshes to reduce their complexity while maintaining their overall appearance. This is particularly useful in 3D graphics and game development for improving performance by reducing the number of vertices and triangles that need to be processed and rendered, especially for objects that are farther away from the camera. Let's break down the key parts of this system: # Imports The script starts by importing necessary namespaces from Unity's core, DOTS, mathematics libraries, and rendering systems, which provide foundational classes and methods required for mesh processing, job system integration, and interaction with Unity's rendering pipeline. # MeshSimplificationSystem Class - Inherits from \`JobComponentSystem\`, making it part of Unity's ECS framework. This system is designed to operate on entities/components in a highly efficient and parallelizable manner. - \`SimplificationRatio\`: A constant that presumably would control the degree to which meshes are simplified (though it's not directly used in the provided code snippet). # MeshData Struct - Acts as a component to store mesh data within ECS entities, using \`NativeArray<float3>\` for vertex positions and \`NativeArray<int>\` for triangle indices. These native arrays are optimized for high-performance operations and are compatible with Unity's job system and burst compiler. # SimplifyMeshJob Struct - A job struct tagged with \`[BurstCompile]\` to enable compilation with Unity's Burst compiler for high performance. It implements \`IJobForEachWithEntity<MeshData>\`, indicating it is designed to process each entity with \`MeshData\` component in parallel. - The \`Execute\` method, which would run for each entity, contains a placeholder for mesh simplification logic. Actual mesh simplification algorithms like Quadric Error Metrics are complex and involve reducing the mesh's vertex and triangle count while attempting to preserve the appearance as much as possible. # OnUpdate Method - Overrides \`JobComponentSystem.OnUpdate\`, scheduling the \`SimplifyMeshJob\` to run on all entities with the \`MeshData\` component. This method ties the job to the ECS lifecycle, allowing it to be executed during the system's update cycle with \`inputDeps\` indicating the job's dependency on other jobs completing. # Additional Methods - The code also sketches out ideas for further development, including automatic LOD (Level of Detail) generation, optimization for mesh rendering, error handling, customization of the simplification process, visualization tools, and performance optimizations. These are outlined with comments and imply a comprehensive system that not only simplifies meshes but also integrates with Unity's rendering systems, provides user interactivity, and ensures robust performance optimizations. This snippet provides a conceptual framework for a mesh simplification system within Unity's ECS and DOTS environment. However, the actual simplification logic, error handling, and rendering optimizations would require significant additional implementation to realize a complete system. The placeholder comments and outlined methods suggest areas for further development, focusing on performance, user customization, and integration with Unity's advanced rendering capabilities."},{"instruction":"AssetsSimplestarGameSimpleMeshAPISampleScriptsasdc.cs(358,10): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'NativeDisableContainerSafetyRestrictionAttribute' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)

This has occurred since he was hit in the face. The images that he sees appear one above the other. He also notices double vision when he looks to the right. What is the SINGLE most likely nerve to be affected? A. Left abducens nerve B. Left trochlear nerve C. Left oculomotor nerve D. Right trochlear nerve E. Right abducens nerve","output":"In this case, the patient's symptoms suggest damage to a cranial nerve involved in eye movement. Double vision (diplopia) when the images are one above the other (vertical diplopia) particularly when looking down or to the side is indicative of a problem with the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV), which innervates the superior oblique muscle. This muscle is responsible for downward gaze (especially important when going down stairs) and intorsion. The detail that the double vision occurs when the boy looks to the right suggests the problem is on the opposite side of the eye that is having difficulty moving properly. Given that the superior oblique muscle is involved in controlling the vertical movement and rotation of the eye, and considering the left eye would be the one having trouble moving correctly if the issue arises when looking to the right (the right eye would be abducted and the left eye would be adducted), the most likely affected nerve is the: **D.

For a Transformer model with the specifications you've provided (8 attention heads, 256 features, sequence length of 1600, batch size of 32), we can roughly estimate its memory consumption. Keep in mind, this estimate will be approximate since the actual memory usage can significantly vary based on implementation details and the deep learning framework used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). Let's breakdown the major components contributing to the memory consumption: 1. **Model Weights**: This includes the parameters of the model itself. The total number of parameters mainly depends on the number of layers, the embedding size (in this case, 256 features), and the model architecture specifics (feed-forward network sizes, attention heads, etc.). However, the information about the number of layers and the dimensions of the feed-forward network within each layer is missing. Still, we can acknowledge that model weights occupy a constant amount of memory regardless of the batch size. 2. **Activations**: During backpropagation, activations at each layer need to be stored for calculating gradients. The memory needed for activations increases with the batch size. Given the sequence length (1600) and batch size (32), and assuming standard dimensions for hidden layers in the feed-forward part of the Transformer, we can expect this to be a significant memory demand. 3. **Gradients**: Memory is required to store gradients for all the trainable parameters. The memory needed for gradients should be roughly equal to that of the model weights. Now, for a rough calculation: - Considering a model like BERT base as a rough proxy (with about 110 million parameters, even though it has 12 heads and 768 feature size with a shorter sequence length), we can infer that a smaller model as specified would have significantly fewer parameters. However, the sequence length is much longer. Let's say hypothetically, it has around 20-40 million parameters for the sake of an example, understanding your model might be smaller or larger based on actual layer counts and other factors not specified. - Assuming 32-bit floating point numbers for simplicity, each parameter (or gradient) would require 4 bytes. So, for a very rough upper estimate: - Model Weights: ~80MB to ~160MB (20M to 40M parameters) - Activations: This is harder to estimate without more details but expect it to be a multiple of the sequence length, batch size, and feature size. Given the size of the inputs and potential outputs at each layer, this could easily reach into the GBs. - Gradients: Similar to the weights, ~80MB to ~160MB. Realistically, the activations are the primary concern for memory usage during training given your sequence length and batch size, especially since they scale with both of those factors. Techniques like gradient checkpointing (trading compute for memory) and mixed precision training (using 16-bit floats) can significantly reduce the memory footprint. Without specific layer counts and details on feed-forward network sizes, an exact number can't be given, but you're potentially looking at several GBs of memory usage, easily extending into the tens of GBs for a single training step considering everything. Use of mixed precision training can cut these estimates in half, and using gradient checkpointing can reduce memory usage at the cost of additional computation. Keep in mind these are very rough estimates; profiling with actual implementation details in your chosen framework is necessary to get precise numbers."},{"instruction":"порассуждай и напиши мне какие характеристики нужны для модели которая будет предсказывать состояния игры друг за другом вплоть до 2000 состояний, у каждого состяония 256 цифр, ничего кроме рассуждения не пиши","output":"Для создания модели, предсказывающей последовательности состояний игры, где каждое состояние представлено 256 числами, и требуется предсказывать до 2000 таких состояний подряд, необходимо учитывать несколько ключевых характеристик. 1. **Модель с вниманием или рекуррентная модель**: Учитывая длинные последовательности (до 2000 состояний), модели с механизмом внимания, такие как Transformer, могут быть более предпочтительными по сравнению с традиционными рекуррентными нейронными сетями (RNN), поскольку они лучше работают с длинными зависимостями в данных. Transformer модели обладают способностью эффективно обрабатывать большие последовательности благодаря параллелизму и избежанию проблемы затухающего градиента, характерных для RNN. 2. **Размерность скрытых слоев**: Учитывая сложность задачи (2000 шагов предсказания и 256 чисел на шаг), модель должна иметь достаточно большое количество нейронов в скрытых слоях, чтобы вместить такое большое количество информации и уловить сложные зависимости между даннымипредсказание будет также основываться на предыдущих состояниях, модель должна иметь возможность интегрировать информацию из большого количества предыдущих шагов. 3. **Глубина модели**: Большее количество слоев может помочь в изучении более сложных зависимостей в данных, но также увеличивает риск переобучения и требует большего количества вычислительных ресурсов. Следует найти баланс между глубиной и шириной модели для достижения оптимальных результатов. 4. **Регуляризация и Dropout**: Важно использовать механизмы регуляризации, такие как Dropout, чтобы избежать переобучения, особенно учитывая потенциально огромное количество параметров в модели. Это может помочь модели лучше обобщать и адаптироваться к новым, невиданным данным. 5. **Механизмы внимания**: Для улучшения работы с длинными последовательностями можно использовать несколько голов внимания (multi-head attention), что позволит модели одновременно учитывать различные аспекты входных данных на разных уровнях. 6. **Обучение и оптимизация**: Использование адаптивных оптимизаторов, таких как Adam, может ускорить сходимость обучения. Также стоит рассмотреть возможность использования техник, таких как градиентный clipping, для стабилизации процесса обучения. 7. **Представление данных**: Учитывая, что каждое состояние игры представлено 256 числами, необходимо тщательно подходить к их нормализации или стандартизации, чтобы модель могла эффективно обрабатывать входные данные. 8. **Подход к обучению**: В зависимости от особенностей задачи может быть целесообразно использовать учительский подход, где на каждом шаге предсказания используется правильный ответ предыдущего шага в качестве входных данных для следующего, что может помочь модели лучше выучить структуру последовательности. В целом, для предсказания таких длинных последовательностей необходимо создать комплексную и мощную модель, способную эффективно обрабатывать и запоминать большой объем информации. Это требует внимания к деталям архитектуры модели, процесса обучения и предобработки данных."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This is most commonly encountered in \`multipart/form-data\` content types, which are often used for HTTP requests that involve file uploads or submitting forms with multiple parts. When you set the \`Content-Type\` header to \`multipart/form-data\`, you must also specify a \`boundary\` value. This value acts as a delimiter to distinguish between the different parts of the multipart message. Each part might represent a different form field or an uploaded file. Here's a brief explanation of the key elements: 1. **Content-Type:** Specifies the type of content being sent. In the case of forms that upload files, this is often \`multipart/form-data\`. 2. **Boundary:** This is a unique string that will not occur within the content of any part. It's used to separate parts within the HTTP message. When you define a boundary, you prepend it with two hyphen characters (\`--\`) at the beginning of each part, and at the end of the message, you terminate the boundary with two hyphens immediately following the boundary string. An example of a \`Content-Type\` header for a \`multipart/form-data\` might look like this: \`\`\` Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=MyBoundary \`\`\` And the body of the request could look something like this: \`\`\` --MyBoundary Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\"textfield\\" text default --MyBoundary Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\"fileupload\\"; filename=\\"example.txt\\" Content-Type: text/plain <contents of file> --MyBoundary-- \`\`\` In this example, \`MyBoundary\` is used to separate parts of the message. Each part contains headers (such as \`Content-Disposition\` and \`Content-Type\`, if applicable for the part) that describe the part, followed by its content. The boundary string is chosen so as not to conflict with any potential content of the parts. The last boundary indicates the end of the message by ending with \`--MyBoundary--\`. Choosing a unique boundary string is critical to ensuring that the parser does not confuse part of the content as a delimiter. Hence, it is often generated as a long, random sequence of characters to minimize the risk of collision with actual content. When constructing HTTP messages programmatically (such as in HTTP clients or web frameworks), this detail is usually handled automatically."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
