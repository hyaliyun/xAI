technology into educational systems becomes an increasingly dominant theme. The benefits offered by technological advances are too significant to ignore, as they engender opportunities for improved teaching methodologies, more personalized learning experiences, and enhanced access to information. This essay will focus on three central ideas: technology as an enabler of interactive and engaging learning, as a facilitator for personalized education, and as a bridge to equal educational access. The thesis posits that incorporating technology into education is imperative for fostering a more effective, inclusive, and adaptive learning environment. Thesis: The incorporation of technology into educational settings is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of instruction, fostering inclusive learning opportunities, and adapting to various learning styles and needs. Body: 1. Interactive and Engaging Learning: Technology has revolutionized the traditional classroom lecture, offering dynamic and interactive content that engages students more deeply in their learning process. Interactive whiteboards, educational software, and multimedia presentations transform passive learning into active participation. Digital simulations and gamification can bring complex academic concepts to life, making them more tangible and understandable for students. These interventions foster a more compelling educational journey, enabling students to learn by doing, which leads to better retention of knowledge. Transitions: Further exploring this concept, we find... 2. Personalized Education: Furthermore, technology enables the personalization of education for individual students. Learning management systems and adaptive learning software assess student performance in real-time and adjust lesson plans and materials accordingly. The intelligent use of data analytics can identify student strengths and weaknesses, allowing educators to tailor the educational experience to each learner's pace and capacity. By meeting students at their level of understanding, technology assists in bridging gaps in knowledge and fostering an environment where each student can thrive. Transitions: Building upon personalized learning opportunities, technology also serves as... 3. A Bridge to Equal Educational Access: Finally, technology is instrumental in democratizing education. Digital devices and online resources grant rural and underserved communities access to quality educational content and expert instruction. The internet breaks down geographical and socio-economic barriers, ensuring that a student's location is no longer a determinant of the quality of education they can receive. Initiatives such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) offer free or low-cost learning opportunities to anyone with an internet connection, promoting lifelong learning and upskilling across the globe. Transitions: With the immense potential for positive change, it is evident that... Conclusion: In summary, technology plays a pivotal role in transforming education. By facilitating interactive and engaging learning, enabling personalized education, and serving as a bridge to equal access, technology empowers both educators and students alike. As clearly supported by the robust evidence and elaboration presented, technological integration is not merely a modern trend but a fundamental evolution in how society approaches education. To prepare students for a rapidly advancing world, it is our responsibility to embrace and integrate technology in educational practices. This essay affirms the thesis that to sustain an effective, inclusive, and adaptable learning environment, the marriage of education and technology is not only beneficial but essential."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It had rained the previous night, leaving the rugby pitch a slick, muddy battleground. She was shoulder to shoulder with a throng of junior girls, all of them wrapped in the buzz of anticipation. \\"You don't see excitement like this at every school,\\" whispered her new friend, Emily, as she joined Lucia by the field's edge. Emily sported a spirited grin, her eyes sparkling with a fervor Lucia was beginning to understand since arriving at St. Hilda's. The referee's whistle cut through the air, and the match against the rival school, Thornfield Academy, sprang to life. Lucia watched in awe as the seniors, strong and undeterred by the muck below, swiftly moved the ball along the line. Each player displayed the cohesion that came from years of playing together. \\"See how Anna dodges that tackle? She's like a lightning bolt,\\" Emily said, pointing as Anna, a nimble winger, sidestepped an opponent before being grabbed by the shirt and sent cascading into the mud with a laugh. Lucia winced, imagining the impact, but Anna hopped right back up, slapping mud off her legs, her grin unfading. The sight was strangely exhilarating. Mud splattered uniforms became the norm as the game progressed. Faces were streaked with grime, and captive mud adorned bare arms and legs as badges of honor. Every scrum was an artist's palette of earthy browns and greens mixing on the canvas of white and school colors. When Thornfield won a scrum, St. Hilda's pack heaved against their rivals, the strength on display humbling Lucia. Thornfield's scrum-half popped the ball out, only to be met by a fierce tackle from St. Hilda's flanker, Jasmine, who'd broken from the scrum like a shot. The crowd roared, a swell of excitement coursing through Lucia as she clapped and cheered along. \\"Did you see that? Her technique—perfect!\\" Emily enthused as both Jasmine and the Thornfield player rose, laughter trickling between them despite the competitive edge. The match was a tight affair, with neither team giving an inch without a fight. Conversion kicks cut paths through the muddy air, with some falling short, leaving the kicker to wipe the sludge from her eyes and try again. A flushed excitement took Lucia as she watched a St. Hilda's player, Sophie, dash through an opening, the ball tucked securely under her arm. The rival school's fullback zeroed in on her, but with a swerve and a splash of mud, Sophie grounded the ball over the line, scoring a try. A collective cheer erupted from the St. Hilda's supporters, and even Lucia couldn't help but jump up and down in jubilation. With each play, the seniors' enthusiasm became ever more palpable. They loved the game— mud, sweat, collisions and all. It was like they were painting themselves with the field, wearing their exertions for all to see. The final whistle came all too soon, bringing the game to an end with St. Hilda's on top. The girls embraced, regardless of the muck that covered them. It was victory, yes, but more than that, it was the shared joy of a match well played. As the seniors walked off the pitch, leaving heavy footprints in their wake, Lucia felt a glowing sense of awe. The camaraderie, the spirit, the unabashed revelry in the face of the mud—it was infectious. She could scarcely wait until her hands were as muddy as theirs. \\"You'll get into it, Lucia,\\" Emily chuckled, noting her gaze. \\"Before you know it, you'll love this muddy mess as much as the rest of us.\\" And as they turned away from the field, with the victorious team celebrating behind them, Lucia believed her. There was something special about the rough, muddy sport of rugby, and about St. Hilda's. It was a place where girls weren't just allowed to get dirty—they were celebrated for it."},{"instruction":"please write an early chapter of the story. lucia has had a few games lessons - the girls have a lesson with their own form mates every say - but until now the weather has been relatively dry. today it is starting to get muddy and lucia is surprised the lesson is going ahead as normal.","output":"Chapter 3: A Lesson in Mud and Mettle Lucia tugged on her long socks, the fabric bunching slightly above her mud-stained boots. She cast a doubtful glance out of the changing room window where the drizzle painted the pane in countless rivulets. Since her arrival at St. Hilda's, games had always taken place under the scrutiny of a mercilessly clear sky. Today, though, the clouds hung low and brooding. She turned to Emily, who was lacing up her boots with vigorous intent. \\"Are we really going to play in this?\\" Lucia gestured towards the gray outside, where a soft but incessant rain was beginning to transform the rugby pitch into a quagmire. Emily looked up, a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. \\"Of course! A little mud never hurt anyone. Besides, it makes the game all the more fun. You'll see.\\" \\"Fun?\\" Lucia echoed doubtfully. They walked together out to meet their form mates, the air thick with moisture, the rain gradually soaking into the shoulders of their rugby jerseys. The rest of the fourth year assembled—a mosaic of resolved faces, tinged with excitement that was a foreign language to Lucia. Coach Thompson, a sturdy woman with a voice that could slice through the fiercest of winds, stood where the grass already showed signs of losing the battle against the elements. \\"Alright, girls! Today's a perfect day for rugby. Let's get warmed up.\\" As the girls began their stretches and drills, Lucia kept a suspicious eye on the treacherous ground. It betrayed footings, sucked at shoes, and sent splatters of dirt upwards. But there was no retreat, and the coach heralded the start of a practice match with an unwavering blast of her whistle. Playing in mud was unlike anything Lucia had experienced. Each run was hampered by the sludge that clung jealously to her shoes. Each tackle was a recipe for a splattering, and every fall was cushioned by a thick layer of gooey earth. \\"You're holding back, Lucia. Dive in!\\" Emily called over from the scrum line as Lucia hesitated to lock into a ruck. Taking a deep breath, Lucia nodded—less out of confidence and more from the desperation not to let her team down. The ball spun out from the ruck, and by some twist of fate, found its way to Lucia. The slickness of the ball was unexpected, its weight now compounded with the wetness, but she clutched it to her as she'd been taught and made a run for it. Her legs pumped harder, the field ahead blurred into a brown and green canvas. An opponent lunged at her, and she braced for impact—the muddy embrace she had feared. They hit the ground with a wet thud, the world a mix of sky, rain, and uncountable shades of brown. The girls around her cheered, and Lucia, now pinned beneath a tangle of limbs and smiling eyes, felt laughter bubble up from inside her. With help from muddy hands, she rose, muddy from head to toe—and couldn't stop the grin spreading across her mud-splattered face. \\"See? Not so bad, is it?\\" Emily clapped her on the back, leaving a handprint on Lucia's already dirtied jersey. \\"Actually... yeah, it's kind of amazing,\\" Lucia admitted, eyeing her sodden, soiled form. For the rest of the session, Lucia threw herself into the game with abandon. She tackled and was tackled, slipped and recovered, and tossed the slippery ball with a concentration she had never mustered before. Each splatter of mud upon her became a mark of effort, each laugh a note in the symphony of camaraderie. As the practice session drew to a close and the fourth-years jogged back to the changing rooms, Lucia's earlier hesitation seemed a distant memory. She was one of them now—an honest-to-goodness, mud-spattered St. Hilda's girl. \\"So, you survived your first muddy practice then?\\" Emily asked, elbowing Lucia lightly. \\"Not just survived,\\" Lucia replied, peeling the wet jersey off her shoulders, \\"I think I might have thrived.\\" And amidst the steam of the hot showers and the banter of her classmates, Lucia felt a burgeoning sense of belonging, baptized by the mud of the rugby field."},{"instruction":"please write about lucia and her friends bantering in the changing room afterwards. they laugh, joke, tease and boast about just how muddy they got. show their love for the game, especially the chance to get muddy.","output":"Chapter 5: Muddy Medals of Valour The laughter that greeted Lucia as she stepped into the changing room was like a warm bath after the cool rain. Steam curled in the air, heavy with the scent of wet earth and grass, while jerseys became streaked canvases thrown over benches. \\"Good grief, Lucia!\\" Emma called out, catching sight of her. \\"I thought you'd decided to take a personal tour of the pitch—face-first!\\" Lucia just laughed, draping her soggy kit on the hook. \\"I wanted an authentic experience. You've got to immerse yourself in local customs, right?\\" A chorus of giggles ricocheted off the tiled walls. Nearby, Jasmine was assessing the damage to her socks, seemingly elongating them to twice their size. \\"At this rate, I'm going to need new kit every game. The mud's practically eating through!\\" \\"New kit? Please!\\" scoffed another girl, Alice. \\"The mud is a badge of honor. I'll have you know the dirtier the socks, the fiercer the player!\\" \\"And there I was thinking it was just poor laundry skills,\\" chided Emily, with a wink in Alice's direction. A girl from the far end of the locker row, Sophie, chimed in, raising her arm, caked in layers of mud. \\"I'd like to award myself the prize for the muddiest elbow. I think I've achieved a new shade of brown!\\" \\"It's a lovely shade on you,\\" laughed Emily, \\"complements your eyes.\\" The room erupted with laughter as the girls joyously hurled backhanded compliments at one another, each jest shared with the easiness of affection. Mud-caked faces beamed as boots were prised off, leaving squelching sounds and muddy imprints on the floor. Lucia caught her reflection in the changing room mirror—an oddly transformed version of herself with hair plastered to her forehead and muddy streaks across her cheeks. She didn't recognize the rugby-warrior that stared back, and yet, she felt a profound kinship with her. \\"Pity the mud's not permanent. I'd have loved to keep this look for class,\\" Lucia quipped, earning a fresh round of laughter. \\"Can you imagine Miss Carter's face if we rocked up to English looking like this?\\" Emily asked, tugging her hair free of a particularly resistant clod. \\"I dare say she'd faint,\\" Jasmine said, tossing a wet towel into the laundry basket. \\"Though, she might appreciate the dedication to our school sports.\\" \\"As if we needed an excuse to show off our bruises and battle scars,\\" grinned Emma, rolling down her sleeves to reveal a set of impressive muddy marks. Banter continued to bubble as showers hissed and lockers slammed. Though spent from their efforts, the room felt alive with the invincible energy of youth and shared triumphs. Finally toweling off the remaining traces of the field, Lucia couldn't help but smile at the spirited repartee. This was a different kind of learning—the learning of being part of a team. A camaraderie not just built on victory, but on every slide, slip, and splash in the unforgettable embrace of the mud. By the time they were dressed and ready to face the rest of their school day, Lucia felt the inexorable truth settling in her bones—she had found her place, not because she was any less muddy, or any more skilled than when the day began, but because she reveled in it alongside friends who wouldn't have it any other way."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Recycling serves as a critical component in the battle for sustainability, offering a practical avenue for resource conservation, waste reduction, and pollution control. The institution of mandatory recycling programs stands as one of the most effective strategies to confront this environmental challenge. This essay proposes a comprehensive argument, structured by three main ideas: the environmental benefits of mandatory recycling, economic advantages for communities and industries, and the vital role of education and public awareness in recycling efforts. By mandating recycling processes, we can achieve significant strides towards an eco-friendly future, yielding benefits across multiple dimensions of society. Thesis Statement: Mandatory recycling programs are essential for promoting environmental sustainability, providing economic benefits, and enhancing public education and participation, and thus should be widely implemented. Body: Environmental Benefits: Mandatory recycling programs drastically reduce the volume of waste sent to landfills and incinerators, directly mitigating landfill overcapacity and air pollution. As waste breaks down, it produces greenhouse gases like methane, which contribute to global warming. Recycling reduces this impact by diverting potential waste from landfills. Furthermore, it conserves natural resources by repurposing materials, therefore decreasing the demand for virgin resources and associated environmental disruption from extraction processes. Moreover, significant energy savings result from recycling, as the energy required to manufacture products from recycled materials is markedly less than that necessary to produce from raw materials. Economic Advantages: Communities that implement mandatory recycling programs can reap substantial economic benefits. Recycling supports a circular economy—materials flow back into production cycles, reducing material costs and fostering innovation. The recycling industry also generates job opportunities, spanning collection, sorting, and processing sectors, and indirectly through the demand for recycled-content products. It encourages local business growth by establishing a stable supply of recycled materials, and by encouraging competitive markets for these resources. A mandatory system ensures consistent material supply, which stabilizes operations and investment in recycling infrastructure. Education and Public Awareness: Mandatory recycling programs necessitate educational initiatives to inform the public about the importance and methods of proper recycling. Education is the linchpin that catalyzes individual action. With clear guidelines and the rationale for these practices, individuals are more likely to participate effectively. Moreover, incorporating recycling education into school curricula cultivates eco-conscious citizens who will carry these practices into adulthood. Public awareness campaigns also play a significant role in dispelling myths about recycling and emphasizing its urgency, thereby fostering a societal paradigm shift toward environmental stewardship. Conclusion: In conclusion, mandatory recycling programs offer a multifaceted solution to pressing environmental issues. These programs are instrumental in promoting environmental preservation, generating economic growth, and encouraging educational efforts towards greater public involvement. By staying focused on the interconnected goals of ecological integrity, communal prosperity, and widespread informed participation, mandatory recycling underpins our shared vision for a sustainable future. The robust support of evidence and expert consensus underlines the logical and necessary path: to enact and enforce comprehensive recycling mandates. With a firm command of the language of sustainability and an uncompromised adherence to the structure of argumentation, this essay underscores the indisputable importance of mandatory recycling programs as a cornerstone of our environmental actions."},{"instruction":"we are working on a girls boarding school story in the style of the st clares stories. the school is called st hildas. it is similar to schools like st clares but the girls all play rugby instead of lacrosse or hockey. the school prides itself on not treating the girls as delicate or fragile - though it is a good school and the girls are treated well, as at st clares. main character Lucia has transferred to st hildas from a more traditional school at the start of the fourth year. while no sissy, she finds the rough and tumble sport at st hildas a challenge, especially as she has never played rugby before while all her classmates have been playing for three years while they were in the lower forms. please write a chapter early in the book. lucia is watching a senior rugby match against a rival school with one of her new friends. it is muddy but no one cares. lucia is still very new to the game and her friend is helping her to understand. the junior girls all look up to the seniors for their skill at the game. the tone is wholesome but lighthearted. emphasize the muddy sporty fun. use down to earth language and dont preach. the chapter should convey a sense of the girls enjoying a hard fought match, but it is fun and not a grim struggle. the outcome matters, but enjoying the game matters more. the match should be realistic and follow the rules of rugby union. describe in detail some exciting events in the match, such as (these are just examples) tackles, conversion kicks, tries and diving for the ball. show how the girls relish the rough and dirty game. describe the muddy appearance of the players - their bodies (bare arms, legs, hands, faces, hair) as well as their kit - as the game goes on to add atmosphere, remembering that most of the players will not instantly be covered head to toe but will gradually get muddier play by play. far from minding, the players think its fun getting muddy.","output":"Chapter Five: Muddy Glory at St. Hilda's Lucia stood on the sidelines, the cool breeze tugging at her hair, as she watched the senior girls of St. Hilda’s charge across the rugby pitch.

The senior girls, clad in their school colors—a deep navy punctuated with bright gold ascents—were a force of nature. Their kit, initially crisp and clean, was now baptized with the rite of a good scrum. Mud splattered up their legs in patterns unique as snowflakes and smeared across their forearms with each tense encounter on the ground. Lucia watched, a mix of admiration and apprehension threading through her thoughts. In her former school, sports were played with precision and a certain decorum. But here at St. Hilda's, the girls reveled in the physicality, unbothered by scrapes or the earth that clung to them. A roar rose from the crowd as Thomson plucked the ball from a melee of players and dodged a tackle. Her gold-trimmed navy jersey was no more a concealer of mud than a signpost of her fearlessness as the St. Hilda’s fullback. Lucia could see the respect shining in the eyes of the junior girls watching; each hit absorbed or delivered seemed to forge a deeper bond, an acknowledgment of shared fortitude. Emma grabbed Lucia’s arm, \\"That's what playing St. Hilda's rugby is all about! We get knocked down, muddy and bruised, but we always come back for more because it's exhilarating!\\" The game was surprisingly fluid considering the quagmire that the pitch had become. Skillful passing led to a textbook ruck, setting up the perfect opportunity for a breakaway. The scrum-half, her face smeared with a badge of earth, zipped a pass to the winger, who with a burst of speed, broke through the rival defenses. Lucia watched as the winger, legs pumping and breath making misty plumes in the chill air, flew toward the try line. A defender from the opposing school launched a desperate tackle, and both girls tumbled into a sliding dance of momentum. They skidded to a stop, with St. Hilda's emerging triumphant, the ball pressed firmly in the try zone. The cheering was deafening. \\"Did you see that dive?!\\" Emma shouted over the noise, beaming with pride. \\"That’s Parker, she's not the biggest but no one can rival her speed!\\" Lucia nodded, clapping along with the rest. She felt a thrill, a wanting to be a part of that team spirit, that unbridled joy. A conversion kick followed, the ball sailing between the uprights despite the muddied state of play—the kicker's jersey a testament to how many times she had been at the bottom of a ruck. Lucia was slowly but surely getting drawn into the excitement of the game, her initial trepidation giving way to an eagerness to join in the raucous, muddy spectacle. It wasn't just about the outcome here; it was about the thrill of the game, the pleasure of pushing limits, and the sense of belonging to a community that laughed in the face of mud and adored every tackle, scrum, and try. Emma leaned in, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. \\"Wait till you’re in the thick of it, Lucia. There's nothing like the rush of adrenaline when you’ve got the ball and an open field ahead. Just you wait!\\" As the final whistle blew, signaling the end of the match, the senior girls of St. Hilda’s, all mud-drenched and glorious, embraced each other in victory. Lucia could see it wasn't just about winning; it was about the camaraderie formed in the muddy trenches, the shared laughter as they hosed down their kits, and the unspoken promise of many more games to come. Her heart warmed to the thought. Maybe, just maybe, she could find her place among these mighty girls of St. Hilda’s."},{"instruction":"asdf","output":"Hello!

Однако, если вы хотите посмотреть настройки портов, такие как VLAN-конфигурацию, статус порта, скорость и дуплекс, на коммутаторах HP ProCurve можно использовать следующие команды: 1. Чтобы подключиться к коммутатору, вы можете использовать программу эмуляции терминала, такую как PuTTY, через SSH или Telnet. Также можно использовать консольный порт с помощью кабеля и программы типа HyperTerminal или PuTTY. 2. Войдите в CLI коммутатора используя ваше имя пользователя и пароль. 3. Используйте команду \`show running-config\` чтобы показать текущую рабочую конфигурацию коммутатора. Это покажет все настройки, включая конфигурацию VLAN и какие порты в них участвуют: \`\`\` show running-config \`\`\` 4. Команда \`show interfaces\` показывает статус интерфейсов, включая административный статус и состояние протокола, скорость и дуплексные настройки: \`\`\` show interfaces \`\`\` 5. Если вы интересуетесь конкретным портом, вы можете уточнить команду, указав интерфейс, например: \`\`\` show interfaces ethernet 1 \`\`\` 6. Для просмотра информации по VLAN используйте команду: \`\`\` show vlan \`\`\` Если же вы действительно ищете информацию о перенаправлении портов как на маршрутизаторе и у вас в сети есть маршрутизатор HP с установленным ProCurve, вы захотите искать информацию о функциях NAT или ACL, которые могут быть реализованы в устройствах более высокого уровня, выполняющих маршрутизацию.

In the modern era, the clear and present danger of climate change stands as a formidable adversary, one that we are compelled to confront. The thesis of this essay is straightforward: Immediate, decisive action against climate change is a non-negotiable obligation for the continuation of life on Earth as we know it. There are three main arguments that underpin this claim: the irreversible damage to natural ecosystems, the negative impacts on human health, and the economic upheaval that unchecked climate change will invariably cause. **Body** **Irreversible Damage to Ecosystems** Firstly, the unchecked progression of climate change threatens to irreparably damage our planet's delicate ecosystems. As the Earth's average temperature rises, polar ice caps melt, sea levels rise, and habitats for countless species are decimated. Research shows that the current rate of species extinction is tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10 million years, and climate change is a primary driver of this loss. This not only diminishes biodiversity but also destabilizes food chains and compromises the natural services ecosystems provide, from carbon sequestration to clean water supply. Failure to act places untold pressure on already endangered species, edging them closer to extinction, which would result in a cascade of ecological consequences. **Negative Impacts on Human Health** Secondly, climate change poses severe risks to human health. The rise in the prevalence of extreme weather events—such as heatwaves, hurricanes, and droughts—has been linked to increased mortality and morbidity. Additionally, shifting climate patterns affect the spread of infectious diseases, with warmer temperatures extending the range of vectors like mosquitoes, bringing diseases such as malaria to previously unaffected areas. Poor air quality, exacerbated by climate-linked wildfires and industrial emissions, contributes to respiratory conditions like asthma. The health repercussions are far-reaching and disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations, illuminating a grave social justice issue that demands immediate attention. **Economic Upheaval** Lastly, the economic ramifications of inaction are colossal. The cost of natural disasters, intensified by climate change, is projected to rise exponentially, with predictions of global economic losses reaching trillions of dollars by the end of the century if current trends persist. The agriculture sector, heavily reliant on stable weather patterns, faces uncertainty, threatening food security worldwide. Moreover, transitioning to a green economy later rather than sooner will only magnify transition costs and market disruptions. Proactive investment in renewable energy and sustainable practices, as opposed to reactive expenditure on disaster management and relief, will not only alleviate future fiscal strain but also spawn new industries and job opportunities. **Conclusion** In summation, the evidence pointing to the urgent need for climate action is incontrovertible. From the irreversible destruction of natural ecosystems, the dire health implications for humanity, to the impending economic crisis, climate change demands a response that is both unified and immediate. This essay has endeavored to maintain an unwavering focus on the subject matter, highlighted by clear and logical progression from one idea to the next. In recapitulating the most compelling reasons for urgent climate action, it is evident that our generation's legacy hinges on the decisions made today. By choosing the path of environmental stewardship and sustainability, we uphold our responsibility to the planet and to future generations. Let this essay serve not only as a call to consciousness but also as a beacon for collective, transformative action. The time for debate has passed, the time for action is now."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

If you are speaking in general about any kind of comprehensive error detection in a professional, academic, or technical context, there's no definitive list of \\"stuff\\" one must know without more information regarding the specific application or area. In many cases, \\"comprehensive error detection\\" would refer to the processes and techniques used to identify and correct errors in a system, which could encompass a wide range of knowledge and skills depending on the field, including: 1. Understanding of the system or process you're evaluating. 2. Knowledge of the common types of errors that can occur within the system. 3. Techniques to monitor or test the system to uncover these errors. 4. Methods to correct or mitigate the detected errors. 5. Knowledge of how to prevent errors from occurring in the future, possibly through system design, guidelines, or best practices. 6. Familiarity with error detection and correction algorithms or protocols specific to the field. 7. The relevant tools and technologies used in the detection and correction of errors. For example, in computer science, error detection might involve parity bits, checksums, or more sophisticated measures like cyclic redundancy checks (CRC) and forward error correction (FEC) codes. In quality control or manufacturing, it might involve statistical process control (SPC) and root cause analysis (RCA). In finance, it could involve auditing practices, compliance checks, and internal controls. If you're referring to \\"CED\\" in a specific context, such as a protocol, software, or course, you would need to study the particular guidelines or material provided by that protocol, application, or course syllabus to know what you must understand fully.

As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the CED includes several key components: 1. **Historical Thinking Skills**: These are analytical skills that students need to apply when studying history, including comparison, causation, continuity and change over time, and synthesis. 2. **Thematic Learning Objectives**: The CED outlines themes that connect historical developments in different times and places. Understanding these themes is critical. They include American and national identity; politics and power; work, exchange, and technology; culture and society; migration and settlement; geography and the environment; and America in the world. 3. **Concept Outline**: This is the backbone of the content you need to know for APUSH. It is organized into nine periods of U.S. history, which are broken down into key concepts. Within each key concept are several subpoints that explain more specific topics and events. Make sure you know: - The **main ideas** of each key concept. - **Significant events**, people, and movements associated with those concepts. - **Examples** that illustrate each concept. 4. **Historical Periods**: The CED breaks down U.S. history into different periods, each with its themes and developments. You should be familiar with the main events and trends from each period. 5. **Primary and Secondary Sources**: The APUSH exam features multiple-choice and free-response questions that require you to analyze historical documents, so practice working with these types of sources is essential. 6. **Practice Questions**: The CED includes sample multiple-choice, short-answer, long-essay, and document-based questions. You should be familiar with the format and expectations of these questions. 7. **Rubrics for Free Response Questions**: Understanding how the free-response questions are scored will help you know what is essential when constructing your answers. To succeed on the APUSH exam, focusing on the following areas is particularly important: - Develop a strong understanding of major events, themes, and periods in U.S. history. - Master the use of historical thinking skills to analyze and interpret historical evidence. - Be able to write clear and well-reasoned essays that relate specific historical evidence to larger themes and concepts. - Practice using primary and secondary sources to build and support an argument. Remember, the APUSH course and exam is subject to updates or changes, so it's vital to check the latest CED or consult with your APUSH teacher for the current information.

The College Board provides a Curriculum and Exam Description (CED) that outlines the specific content that can appear on the exam. The most recent CED should be the main reference as it lists the concepts and skills you need to know for the APUSH exam. Here are the main themes and concepts you should be thoroughly familiar with: 1. **Periods**: APUSH covers 9 periods in U.S. history, spanning from 1491 to the present. Each period emphasizes different themes, developments, and processes in the context of historical events. Knowing the major events, trends, and important figures from each period is crucial. 2. **Thematic Learning Objectives**: The CED outlines several key themes that you should be able to connect to different time periods and events. These can include American and National Identity, Politics and Power, Work, Exchange, and Technology, Culture and Society, Migration and Settlement, Geography and the Environment, and America in the World. 3. **Historical Thinking Skills**: The College Board focuses on a set of skills that students should be able to demonstrate, such as chronological reasoning, comparison and contextualization, crafting historical arguments using historical evidence, and interpretation and synthesis. 4. **Key Concepts**: Each period has key concepts that students need to understand. These concepts are essentially summaries of the most important developments and trends for each era. 5. **Concept Outline**: The CED provides a detailed outline of each period with points that explain what you should know about the period's political, social, cultural, and economic dimensions. 6. **Historical Evidence Examples**: While you won't need to know every detail in the CED, being familiar with suggested primary and secondary sources as well as the types of evidence they could provide is beneficial. 7. **Practice, Review, and Understand**: Practice with past exam questions and understand the exam's structure: multiple-choice, short-answer, long essay, and document-based questions (DBQ). Being able to apply your knowledge in these contexts is just as important as the content knowledge itself. It is quite difficult, if not nearly impossible, to predict exactly which specific facts or issues will be 100% necessary for any given exam, as the questions will vary each year. However, focus on major events, laws, policies, movements, and figures that had significant impacts on the country's development. Lastly, while the CED gives you a roadmap for studying, it's also a good idea to keep an eye on the APUSH exam rubrics since they'll guide you on how your responses will be assessed. Always check for the latest updates and version of the CED to ensure that you are studying the most accurate and up-to-date information."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here is an enhanced version of your original prompt for an image generation task that corrects spelling errors and improves clarity for a cinematic depiction: Title: The Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD as Viewed from a Pompeian Street Description: In the bustling streets of ancient Pompeii, we zoom in on a lively outdoor street restaurant. It is a warm, sunlit day in the year 79 AD. Patrons, including Grecian women draped in traditional garments, are enjoying their meals, oblivious to the impending disaster. One of the women takes a bite of her figiscus, an ancient Roman bread, as she suddenly notices a plume of smoke rising in the distance. The streets are filled with Roman citizens engaging in daily activities, unaware that Mount Vesuvius looms ominously in the background. A gentle, foreboding rumble can be felt. Smoke begins to billow from the mountain's peak, and a sense of unease starts to ripple through the crowds. As patrons dine, a petty robbery unfolds at the edge of the frame, contrasting the tranquility and the looming chaos. The thief, a sly figure, deftly snatches a pouch from a distracted diner. The scene captures the dramatic irony of life continuing in the shadow of the volcano, encapsulating the peace before the eruption that will change the course of history. Ensure the image conveys the cinematic tension of a moment frozen in time, with the majestic and fearsome Mount Vesuvius preparing to unleash its fury on the unsuspecting city of Pompeii. The lighting should be natural and warm, hinting at the catastrophe that is about to envelop the city from the serene mountain in the background, while life in the foreground proceeds unaffected for the last few moments before the eruption. Remember, historical accuracy is important; include appropriate clothing, architecture, and cultural elements to reflect ancient Pompeii in 79 AD."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee and flower","output":"\\"Stunning Coffee and Flower Design | Versatile Art for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Botanical & Beverage Illustration\\""},{"instruction":"いやいやいや そりゃ～ないでしょトレちゃんさー translate 5 options english informal","output":"1.

She shivered slightly in the brisk air but felt a certain warmth emanating from the excitement and rowdiness of the crowd around her, mostly consisting of girls from various forms, all cheering for St. Hilda's senior rugby team. Next to her stood Alice, a fellow fourth-year but a seasoned veteran on the junior team. Her enthusiasm was infectious, and her commentary was as relentless as the players' pursuit of the ball. \\"Watch number 8, Lucia!\\" Alice shouted over the din of cheers, pointing toward a burly senior with braids dangling from her scrum cap. \\"She's one of our best. Pure strength and a mind for strategy too!\\" Lucia nodded, squinting through the sporadic splatters of mud that flew up even to the spectators. She watched as number 8 snatched the ball from the back of a scrum, her legs pumping as she charged into the opposition, her white socks quickly turning a shade of earthy brown. A gasp surged through the crowd as number 8 was tackled, both players sliding a good meter into the sludge before coming to a halt. Lucia winced, expecting cries of pain or frustration, but instead, the tackled player laughed, her white teeth a stark contrast to the mud that now streaked her cheeks. \\"They really don't seem to mind getting dirty, do they?\\" Lucia remarked, brushing a fleck of mud from her own sleeve instinctively. \\"That's part of the fun!\\" Alice responded, her eyes not leaving the game as the ball was quickly worked loose and passed out to the backline. She pointed excitedly as a wing with stockings turned to clumps of dirt galloped down the pitch. \\"Look at Sophie go! Speedy and slippery as an eel, even in this muck!\\" The wing dodged a diving tackle, slipped in the mud, but found her footing in a spectacular display of balance. The crowd erupted as she dived over the try line, planting the ball firmly into the squelching Earth. Mud splashed up to colour her back, and her ponytail dipped into the mud, coming up with a heavy brown tip. Lucia found herself cheering along as the girl stood up and fist-pumped the air, her once blue jersey almost indistinguishable from the earthy field. The whole team rushed to congratulate her, leaving smudged prints on each other's shoulders and faces. Alice nudged Lucia playfully. \\"One day, that'll be you out there, diving for glory!\\" \\"Heaven help me,\\" Lucia laughed, the idea still slightly foreign to her, but the thrill of the game was seeping into her veins. They watched intently as a mud-splattered player from their team set the ball up for a conversion kick, steadying it into the makeshift tee with hands smeared in muck. With a hush from the crowd, she took the necessary steps back, mud caking her cleats, and then charged. The kick sliced through the air, the ball spinning end over end, and split the uprights, to the delight of St. Hilda's supporters. The players were more mud than anything else now, their bodies sliding, diving, and driving through each play. Lucia noticed how their laughter mixed with the calls of the game, how despite the competitive streak, there was an undeniable sense of camaraderie and sheer joy. When the final whistle blew, signifying a hard-fought victory for St. Hilda's, Lucia felt a twinge of pride swell in her chest. The girls, regardless of the score, seemed to be celebrating the mere act of playing, the delight in their muddy faces unwavering. As they began to leave the sidelines, Alice turned to Lucia. \\"You'll pick it up quick, I promise. And the mud? It's like a badge of honor.\\" Lucia looked back at the pitch, the players now shaking hands with their opponents, all indistinguishably happy and gloriously filthy. She couldn't help but smile, thinking that perhaps the mud didn't seem so daunting after all. It was, she realized, just another part of the wild, wonderful world of St. Hilda's."},{"instruction":"first really muddy games lesson. the games mistress subtly picks exercises which dont just teach the girls - especially lucia, who is not as used to it as evergone else - game skills but encourage them to embrace getting really dirty as they play.","output":"# Chapter Eight: Lucia's Inaugural Muddy Plunge Lucia treaded cautiously on the rain-soaked pitch, her boots squelching in the soft earth. The gray clouds above seemed to mimick the games mistress's stony determination. Miss Thornley, a former rugby star herself, stood before the class—a mix of seasoned players and new recruits—with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. \\"Today, ladies,\\" Miss Thornley spoke up, her voice cutting through the chilly air, \\"we will focus on the true essence of rugby—grit, power, and of course, an appreciation for the earth beneath our feet.\\" The girls exchanged knowing looks; they were aware of the games mistress's philosophy of embracing the muck and might of the game. For Lucia, still pristine in her new kit, the idea of diving into the mire was met with a mix of trepidation and curiosity. Miss Thornley began with a warm-up, urging them to crawl, commando-style, across the field. The once-reluctant novice players, including Lucia, soon found themselves laughing as they became streaked with slime, their hands and knees covered in mud. Next, they transitioned into ruck drills. Lucia watched as the more experienced players plunged into the fray, battling over a ball that was swiftly becoming indistinct from the earth itself. When it was her turn, she heaved a breath, bent her knees, and joined the tangle of bodies, feeling the mud seep through her clothes and stick to her skin. The unexpected liberation of being caked in dirt sparked a grin on her face. \\"Splendid, Lucia!\\" Miss Thornley called out as she saw the girl fully commit—no longer holding back, no longer the clean newcomer. The lesson continued with paired tackle practices. Lucia was paired with a girl named Hannah, and as they took turns running and tackling, each collision with the ground drew a fresh layer of sludge up their legs and arms. It wasn't long before Lucia could barely discern the original colors of her kit. Even her dark hair was tinged with brown, stuck to the sides of her face in muddy clumps. Seeing the girls' growing confidence with every soil-stained slide, the games mistress moved to a simulated game. By now, the lesson had morphed into a gleeful celebration of filth and ferocity. The air was filled with cheers and laughter, punctuated by the splatter of mud with each tackle and dive for the ball. \\"Remember, girls, control and courage!\\" Miss Thornley shouted her encouragements. The pitch was transformed into a battlefield of camaraderie, where every player emerged a muddy, triumphant warrior. As practice concluded, with heavy breathing and muck-drenched jerseys plastered to their bodies, Lucia looked around at her fellow players. There was an unspoken bond that had formed, solidified by the shared experience of grueling effort and earthy adornment. Walking off the field, Lucia felt a new connection with her teammates. Her apprehension was replaced with a sense of achievement and belonging. She caught a glimpse of her reflection in a window—unrecognizable, caked in nature's warpaint—she couldn't suppress a chuckle. Miss Thornley approached her, hands on hips, a grin beneath the layers of dirt on her face. \\"It's more than a game,\\" she said. \\"It's a testament to your spirit, Lucia. Remember this feeling, and let it drive you on the field.\\" And as Lucia hosed down her kit later that day, watching the water turn a murky brown before clearing, she knew that she had begun to understand the true spirit of St. Hilda's—a spirit not afraid to get down, get dirty, and revel in every muddy moment of it."},{"instruction":"please write about lucia and her friends bantering in the changing room afterwards. they laugh, joke, tease and boast about just how muddy they got. show their love for the game, especially the chance to get muddy.","output":"# Chapter Nine: The Battle Scars of St. Hilda's The changing room was alive with the sound of laughter and running water as the girls of St. Hilda's peeled off their layers of mud-soaked gear. Steam rose and mixed with the earthy scent of the outdoors, lingering in the air like a fog of triumph. \\"Lucia, you sure you played before?\\" teased a grinning Emily as she wrung out a clump of mud from her hair. \\"Because by the looks of it, you've been doing a face-first dive practice all morning!\\" Lucia responded with a playful roll of her eyes, \\"Oh, please, I didn't see you treating that pitch with any more grace, Emily. You were practically making mud angels every time you went down!\\" A chorus of giggles filled the space as the girls high-fived each other, celebrating their shared dishevelment. With each strip of muddy fabric that hit the floor, a new story unfolded. \\"Check this out,\\" said Hannah, pointing to the imprint of a rugby ball splashed across her jersey. \\"It's like modern art, only muddier!\\" \\"You gotta appreciate the aesthetic of the game,\\" Alice chimed in, trying to untangle a particularly stubborn knot of mud-drenched hair. \\"Mud splatters are the true mark of a St. Hilda's player.\\" \\"Speaking of art,\\" Lucia joined in the moment, holding up her once-white socks, now smeared with streaks and blotches, \\"I think I've got everyone beat in the abstract expressionism department!\\" A few lockers down, Sophie, who was known for her dazzling runs on the field, boasted, \\"Well, I'm pretty sure I was sliding so much, I could have started a whole new game. Mud-skating, anyone?\\" \\"Oh, I'd pay to see that in the Olympics,\\" laughed Grace, her voice muffled as she wrestled with her sports bra, which seemed to have fused with her skin. Amid the jokes and jabs, the underlying sentiment was clear—the girls revered the game and the mess that came with it. It wasn't just about scoring and winning. It was about the sheer exhilaration of the play, the battles fought, and the sisterhood forged through shared challenges. The water from the showers washed away the layers of dirt, revealing the flushed, happy faces beneath. Cloth by cloth and layer by layer, the girls transformed back into their school selves, leaving their warrior personas to dry with their kits. Yet even as the mud went down the drains, it left a residue. The presence of the game lingered in the room, a bond over the joyous abandon they found in the scrummages and the satisfaction of a good, dirty play—elements that made their time at St. Hilda's unique. \\"I don't think I'll ever get used to how heavy mud makes your boots feel,\\" Lucia mused, the laughter subsiding into a content hum as she slid on a clean pair of socks. \\"But somehow, it makes scoring that much sweeter.\\" \\"Ah, you're one of us now,\\" Alice quipped, wrapping a towel around her shoulders. \\"Next thing you know, you'll be looking forward to rain forecasts!\\" Sophie winked. \\"Just wait until match day, Lucia. If you think our practices are epic, just wait until you see us take on our rivals. The mud, the glory, the Hilda's spirit...

The games lesson had moved up a gear, and today Miss Thornley had decided it was time for the fourth years to refine their scrum techniques. Lucia watched, fascinated, as Miss Thornley demonstrated the positioning with practiced ease, pointing out the importance of stability and strength. The girls shuffled their boots into the soft earth, feeling for a solid grip as they mirrored her stance. Lucia found her position as a lock and felt a shiver of excitement roll through her – she knew this was the heartbeat of the game. They packed down, eight bodies moving in sync, heads disappearing in the spaces between shoulders and hips, a tangle of limbs bracing for impact. Lucia felt the cool slide of mud against her cheek as her head nudged alongside a prop's grimy jersey. \\"Steady, ladies! And push!\\" Miss Thornley's voice sliced through the grunts and heavy breathing. The two packs collided with a squelch, their boots instantly churning the ground beneath them into a soup of liquid earth. The thick, dark mud splashed and spattered around, a minuscule moat forming around the contested territory of their joined bodies. Lucia pushed against the slippery resistance, her legs driving through a puddle that seemed determined to capture her boots. Enveloped in the muddy embrace of the scrum, Lucia felt an unexpected grin tug at her lips. The forwards' world was one of gritty intimacy, where every heave and shove bound them tighter. They reset and scrummaged again, the sludge deepening with each confrontation. Lucia watched as her teammates emerged from the fray, wiping away fresh smears of mud from their faces with back of hand or sleeve, their expressions that of warriors mid-battle. Even as the ball squirted out the back, the forwards stayed locked a moment longer, relishing the messy camaraderie. \\"Again!\\" Miss Thornley's command was met with keen nods. Lucia snuck a peek at the backs, looking comparatively cleaner as they practiced their runs and passes, their part of the game no less challenging but lacking the visceral element the scrum offered. A thought settled in Lucia’s mind as she wiggled her toes inside her sodden boots, readying for another push; it was amongst the forwards, within the push and heave of the scrum, where the real fun—and most of the mud—was had. With each scrum, Lucia felt less like the new girl and more a piece of the puzzle that was her team. The mud, which she had once regarded with apprehension, now seemed like a tangible measure of effort and energy spent, a natural extension of the game she was starting to love. As practice concluded and they jogged towards the changing rooms, chuckling about the new levels of muck decorating their kits, Lucia felt a sense of pride. She had not just tackled the practice but had also embraced the messy heart of rugby, realizing that indeed, for a girl at St. Hilda's, there was no greater fun than the rough-and-tumble mudfest of the forwards' world."},{"instruction":"please write about lucia and her friends bantering in the changing room afterwards. they laugh, joke, tease and boast about just how muddy they got. show their love for the game, especially the chance to get muddy.

Can you imagine walking into class like this?\\" Emily gestured to herself, covered in mud from scrum cap to shin guards. \\"I reckon we'd give the art department a run for their money.\\" Lucia managed to finally free herself of the muddy shorts and looked down at her legs, now a tableau of dried and wet mud. \\"I bet I lost at least a kilo in mud weight there,\\" she joked, stepping out of the shorts like they were a discarded shell. The friends erupted into more laughter, their camaraderie underscored by the warm sprays of the showers starting up. One by one, they stepped into the streams of water, the mud beginning to loosen and wash away. Grace leaned out of her shower, \\"You know, there's something incredibly satisfying about getting this messy. It's like the more mud you have, the harder you know you played.\\" The others nodded in agreement, watching rivulets of earth circle down the drains. Lucia thought back to the scrum, to the moments of impact when the game felt most real, where the struggle turned into triumph—and the mud served as a delightful reminder of that transformation. \\"You know,\\" Lucia said, her voice softened by a new sense of belonging, \\"I thought forwards had the most back-breaking jobs, but now, I'm convinced they have the most fun. You all make getting dirty into a spectacle!\\" Hannah, who had just emerged gloriously muddy from the center of a particularly vigorous scrum, smirked. \\"Well, Lucia, if you enjoy the mud so much, next time you're welcome to swap places with me for a bit of 'spectacle.' There's plenty of muck to go around!\\" They shared knowing glances, an unspoken understanding between them. No matter how fierce the game, the mirth they found in the mud was a shared treasure, a joyful anchor to their love for rugby at St. Hilda's."},{"instruction":"Please describe Lucia practicing falling safely. Did she get very muddy? What about her legs, knees, bum, shorts, front of shirt, back of short, shoulders? How did she feel about it?","output":"# Chapter Fifteen: The Art of the Fall Lucia stood at the ready, her heart pounding a steady rhythm in her chest as she watched Miss Thornley demonstrate the proper technique for falling safely. \\"Keep your chin tucked, fall on your side, and try to roll with it,\\" the games mistress instructed, emphasizing the fluid motion with her own body as she hit the soft turf with a practiced grace. The St. Hilda's rugby pitch had become a canvas of muck, thanks to an earlier downpour, setting the perfect stage for today's lesson. One by one, the girls lined up to emulate the correct form, their determined faces dotted with droplets from the overcast sky. Lucia's turn came, and she took a deep breath, running forward before allowing herself to fall as Miss Thornley had shown. Her shoulder hit the ground first, followed by the rest of her body rolling to disperse the impact. A squishy sound escaped beneath her as the wet earth accepted her fall, and for a moment she laid there feeling the cool mud seep through her kit. Laughter bubbled up from her teammates as they watched Lucia stand, now sporting a muddy streak from her shoulder down the length of her arm. Wiping at the smudge did nothing but spread it further. \\"Looks like you've been shoulder-deep in the mud wrestling pit, Lucia!\\" one of the girls called out. She looked down at her legs, where the splashes of mud had made her pale skin almost indistinguishable from the dark shorts which clung heavily to her physique, tinged with a new layer of the earthy brown paste. Her knees bore the brunt of the dirt, turning her once pink skin into shades of the pitch. \\"Perfect form, Lucia! Just remember to keep it loose,\\" Miss Thornley said with an approving nod, oblivious to the giggles around her. \\"Let's see it again!\\" Emboldened by the praise, Lucia repeated the motion, more confidently this time. She hit the ground with a wet thud, ensuring her legs followed suit as she rolled onto her side. Picking herself up, she now noticed the additional mud clinging to her bum and the side of her shorts, making them feel weighted down with the heft of the sodden earth. \\"Great job, Lucia!\\" Alice shouted encouragingly. \\"Your falling is top-notch, even if it means becoming one with the mud!\\" As the practice continued, Lucia found both her front and back accumulating a generous collection of the pitch, with each tumble adding a new layer to her emerging muddy armor. Her shirt, once crisp and clean, now bore the tell-tale sign of repeated falls, front and back alike plastered with patches of thick, wet mud that stuck to her like a second skin. Despite the mess, Lucia couldn't suppress the wild exhilaration she felt—each safe landing reinforced her love for the game, her appreciation for the gritty reality of rugby. It was a revelation how something as simple as learning to fall correctly could invigorate her so profoundly, even as she became a silhouette of mud. Her shoulders, once spared, now didn't escape the splatter as she perfected the movement that would keep her safe in the more ferocious tangles of match play. By the end of the session, Lucia was a mosaic of muck, her entire being enveloped in the remnants of her robust efforts. Jubilantly exhausted, she headed to the changing rooms, the squelch of her boots a testament to the muddy trials of the day. As her friends playfully recounted each other's most epic falls and subsequent mud baths, Lucia felt an undeniable sense of achievement—she'd not only learned to fall without fear but had wholly embraced the messy joy of rugby, mud and all."},{"instruction":"please write a later chapter. lucia has been practicing hard, with help from her new friends, over the intervening months and despite being less experienced than the rest of her year, has won a place in the junior team for a match against a rival school. as with the earlier story, describe a realistic exciting match where the girls want to win but also simply enjoy a good rough, dirty game. lucia makes a valuable contribution to the match and justifies her place on the team but please avoid cliches like lucia scoring the winning try at the last minute.","output":"# Chapter Twenty-Two: Lucia's Moment on the Field Months of grueling practice and countless falls into the muddy embrace of the rugby pitch had led Lucia to this moment. Her heart pounded with a mix of nerves and excitement as she stood with her teammates, the junior squad of St. Hilda's, ready to face their rivals from Bexhill Academy. Lucia's muscles tensed as she listened to the final words of encouragement from Miss Thornley. The long-awaited match stretched out before her like an epic saga unfolding, the cheers of spectators blending with the raucous calls of her teammates as they pumped each other up. The referee's whistle pierced the anticipation, and the match kicked off with a surge of energy. Lucia found herself in the thick of the action, her boots sinking slightly into the forgiving turf. The ball, slick with dew and mud, passed from hand to hand with keen precision, a testament to the endless drills they'd run in practice. Bexhill Academy was a formidable team, their pack solid and their backs swift. Lucia held her ground, focusing on her positioning and remembering the countless times she'd drilled her tackles. Mud sprayed with each impact, a splatter painting formed by the heavy boots and swift moves of devoted players. As a ruck formed, Lucia threw herself into the fray, her face receiving a fresh coat of dark earth as she collided with the opposing team's forwards. She fought for possession, the mud making the ball a treacherous prize, but St. Hilda's came away with it, the crowd erupting in applause. It wasn't long before Lucia found herself in a key moment—her friend Sophie had broken through a line and offloaded the ball just before a tackle. Lucia caught it instinctively, the old hesitation gone, replaced with adrenaline and battle-honed reflexes. She surged forward, her legs pumping, heart racing as she weaved through the opposition, the ground churning beneath her. A Bexhill player lunged, grasping Lucia's leg, pulling her down, but not before she flicked the ball to her teammate, who bolted down the pitch for a try. Lucia's contribution didn't go unnoticed; her quick thinking and solid play added a vital link to the chain that led to the score. As the game wore on, Lucia's earlier apprehension shifted entirely into a deep love for the game. She made tackle after tackle, sometimes being the one to hit the ground, other times the force that brought others down into the sludge that claimed every player before the match's end. The girls of St. Hilda's and Bexhill Academy clashed on even terms, the scoreline tight as each side refused to give an inch. Lucia felt every muscle in her body, every ounce of training she had put in, as she pushed herself to keep up with the experienced players around her. In the end, when the final whistle blew, St. Hilda's had not secured a dramatic last-minute victory, but they had played with ferocity and heart, something far more significant. Lucia, as she panted, smeared in the day's mud, knew she had earned her stripes. Her friends enveloped her in congratulatory hugs, each one leaving a new mud print on her jersey. Walking off the field, Lucia felt the weight of her muddy kit as a reminder of the day's hard-fought battle. She may not have scored the winning try, but her efforts had woven seamlessly into the fabric of the team's performance, and that was victory enough for her. In the changing room, the banter flowed as easily as the showers washed away the grime. Lucia listened to the stories of tackles, runs, and rucks, interjecting with her own experiences. They all agreed one thing was irrefutably true: win or lose, there was no joy quite like playing a tough, dirty game of rugby with your best mates at your side."},{"instruction":"Что понимается под силой тока, плотностью тока, ЭДС источника и напряжением","output":"**Сила тока (I)** – это физическая величина, характеризующая электрический ток, и определяется как количество электрического заряда, проходящее через поперечное сечение проводника за единицу времени. Единица измерения силы тока в системе СИ – ампер (А). Формула для определения силы тока: [ I = frac{dq}{dt} ] где ( dq ) – изменение электрического заряда, а ( dt ) – изменение времени. **Плотность тока (J)** – это векторная физическая величина, описывающая, как сила тока распределена по поперечному сечению проводника. Ее можно рассчитать по формуле: [ J = frac{I}{S} ] где ( I ) – сила тока, проходящего через поперечное сечение проводника, а ( S ) – площадь этого сечения. Плотность тока выражается в амперах на квадратный метр (А/м²). **Электродвижущая сила (ЭДС) источника** – это не сила в буквальном смысле этого слова, а характеристика, определяющая работу, которую производит источник (как, например, батарея или генератор) для перемещения единичного заряда в цепи. ЭДС источника равна разности потенциальной энергии заряда в начальной и конечной точках цепи и определяется как работа, совершаемая над зарядом по всей замкнутой цепи источника, деленная на величину этого заряда. Обычно измеряется в вольтах (В). [ ЭДС = frac{W}{q} ] где ( W ) – работа в джоулях, ( q ) – электрический заряд в кулонах. **Напряжение (U)** – это еще одна величина, связанная с электрическими цепями, и она измеряет разность электрических потенциалов между двумя точками в цепи. Напряжение определяется как работа, необходимая для перемещения единицы электрического заряда из одной точки в другую и также измеряется в вольтах. Для идеальных источников напряжение равно ЭДС, но на практике напряжение на зажимах источника может быть меньше ЭДС из-за внутреннего сопротивления источника.

Основная формулировка закона Ома для участка цепи звучит следующим образом: [ U = I cdot R ] где: - U – напряжение (разность потенциалов) на участке цепи, измеряемое в вольтах (В), - I – сила тока, проходящего через участок цепи, измеряемая в амперах (А), - R – сопротивление участка цепи, измеряемое в омах (Ом). Согласно закону Ома, сила тока прямо пропорциональна напряжению на участке цепи и обратно пропорциональна его сопротивлению. В более общем случае, для полной цепи, учитывающей ЭДС (ε) и внутреннее сопротивление источника тока (r), закон Ома имеет вид: [ I = frac{varepsilon}{R + r} ] где: - ( varepsilon ) – ЭДС источника тока, - R – сопротивление внешней цепи, - r – внутреннее сопротивление источника тока. **Закон Джоуля-Ленца** Закон Джоуля-Ленца описывает тепловое действие электрического тока и утверждает, что количество теплоты, выделенное в проводнике с током, пропорционально квадрату силы тока, сопротивлению проводника и времени прохождения тока.

В алгебраической форме правило записывается как: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0 ] где ( I_k ) – это ток, входящий в узел (+) или выходящий из узла (−), а суммирование осуществляется по всем токам, связанным с этим узлом. # Второе правило Кирхгофа (напряжения или второй закон Кирхгофа) Второй закон Кирхгофа основан на законе сохранения энергии. Он утверждает, что в любом замкнутом контуре электрической цепи алгебраическая сумма произведений токов и сопротивлений на каждом участке плюс сумма ЭДС в этом контуре равна нулю: [ sum_{k=1}^{m} (I_k cdot R_k) + sum_{k=1}^{p} varepsilon_k = 0 ] где ( I_k ) – сила тока на участке к, ( R_k ) – сопротивление на участке к, ( varepsilon_k ) – ЭДС на участке к (выбирается со знаком \\"+\\", если направление тока совпадает с направлением ЭДС, и со знаком \\"−\\", если не совпадает), а суммирование осуществляется по всем участкам контура. Этот закон позволяет установить взаимосвязь между напряжением и ЭДС в цепях с несколькими источниками энергии. Применение правил Кирхгофа необходимо для расчета токов, напряжений и сопротивлений в цепях, содержащих множество ветвей и узлов, а также при наличии нескольких источников ЭДС."},{"instruction":"Почему метод компенсации более точен чем метод амперметра-вольтметра","output":"Метод амперметра-вольтметра и метод компенсации — это два различных метода измерения электрических величин в цепях. Оба имеют свои преимущества и области применения, но метод компенсации часто считается более точным способом измерения, особенно при работе с высокоомными и прецизионными цепями. Вот несколько причин, по которым это так: # Погрешность вносимая приборами: **Метод амперметра-вольтметра:** При использовании этого метода амперметр включается последовательно с измеряемой нагрузкой, и он вносит дополнительное сопротивление в цепь, что может изменить ток в цепи. Вольтметр, с другой стороны, подключается параллельно нагрузке и имеет свое собственное внутреннее сопротивление, которое должно быть достаточно большим, чтобы не изменять напряжение на нагрузке. Однако, если внутреннее сопротивление вольтметра не бесконечно, это также внесет небольшое изменение в общую цепь, что может привести к некоторой погрешности измерения. **Метод компенсации:** В этом методе ток через измеряемую цепь не течет, так как он полностью скомпенсирован за счет \\"противоположного\\" источника (балансирующей ЭДС), в результате чего исключается влияние прибора на цепь. Поскольку тока нет, нет и погрешности измерения, связанной с внутренним сопротивлением приборов измерения. # Точность измерения: **Метод амперметра-вольтметра:** Приборы, используемые в этом методе, имеют свои классы точности, и каждый прибор вносит свою погрешность в общий результат измерений. **Метод компенсации:** Этот метод возможно выполнять с очень высокой точностью благодаря использованию высокоточных эталонов напряжения и сопротивления, а также нулевых гальванометров, которые позволяют определять компенсацию с минимальной ошибкой. # Влияние температуры: **Метод амперметра-вольтметра:** Приборы могут быть подвержены изменениям показаний в зависимости от температуры окружающей среды и самонагрева, вызванного прохождением тока. **Метод компенсации:** Поскольку в методе компенсации ток через измеряемый объект отсутствует, то данный метод менее подвержен ошибкам, вызванным температурными изменениями. В целом, метод компенсации обеспечивает большую точность и воспроизводимость результатов, что делает его предпочтительным методом для калибровки измерительных приборов и точных измерений электрических величин. Однако он более сложен и требует более высокой квалификации оператора, а также может быть дороже в реализации по сравнению с методом амперметра-вольтметра."},{"instruction":"Для чего гальванометр, используемый в мосте постоянного тока, имеет двустороннюю шкалу","output":"Гальванометр, используемый в мосте постоянного тока, часто имеет двустороннюю шкалу для облегчения процесса балансировки моста и улучшения точности измерений. Вот основные причины использования гальванометра с двусторонней шкалой: 1. **Индикация направления тока:** Двусторонняя шкала позволяет легко определить направление тока через гальванометр. Если стрелка отклоняется в одну сторону от нулевой отметки, это указывает на то, что потенциал на одной стороне моста выше, чем на другой, и ток течёт в одном направлении. Если же стрелка отклоняется в противоположную сторону, это указывает на протекание тока в обратном направлении. 2. **Удобство настройки баланса моста:** Мост постоянного тока, такой как мост Уитстона, используется для точных измерений сопротивлений. Процесс настройки моста включает в себя регулировку переменных компонентов (например, реостата или потенциометра) до тех пор, пока гальванометр не покажет нулевое отклонение, что означает, что напряжения на обеих сторонах моста уравновешены. Двусторонняя шкала делает этот процесс более наглядным, поскольку оператор может сразу же видеть, в какую сторону необходимо двигаться для достижения баланса. 3. **Точность измерений:** При работе с очень чувствительными гальванометрами небольшой дисбаланс моста приведет к заметному отклонению стрелки. Двусторонняя шкала помогает оператору точно увидеть, насколько близок мост к точному балансу, даже если стрелка гальванометра отклоняется на небольшую величину. 4. **Симметрия шкалы:** Двусторонняя шкала симметрична относительно нулевой точки, что обеспечивает равную чувствительность индикации при отклонениях в обе стороны. 5. **Диагностика неисправностей:** Если гальванометр показывает значительное и постоянное отклонение от нуля (независимо от регулировок), это может быть индикатором неисправности в мосте или подключенной к нему цепи. Двусторонняя шкала поможет быстрее выявить и устранить эту проблему. Использование гальванометра с двусторонней шкалой упрощает и ускоряет процедуру балансировки моста, позволяет более точно определить значения сопротивлений и повышает надежность и точность измерительной аппаратуры."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Квазистационарными токами называют те токи, параметры которых незначительно меняются за время, в течение которого электромагнитные волны распространяются на расстояния, сравнимые с размерами электрической цепи. При таких условиях изменения тока и напряжения во всех частях цепи происходят практически одновременно. 2. Электромагнитные колебания могут возникнуть в электрической цепи, в состав которой входят индуктивность (катушка) и ёмкость (конденсатор), то есть в колебательном контуре. 3. В электрическом контуре периодически изменяются такие величины, как заряд на обкладках конденсатора, ток в цепи и напряжение на элементах цепи. 4. Дифференциальное уравнение колебаний в идеализированном LC-контуре (без учета активного сопротивления) выводится на основе второго закона Кирхгофа и закона сохранения энергии. В идеальном LC-контуре полная энергия (сумма электрической и магнитной энергий) сохраняется: L(dI/dt)^2/2 + Q^2/(2C) = const где L — индуктивность, I — ток в контуре, C — ёмкость конденсатора, Q — заряд на конденсаторе.

Учитывая закон Ома для полной цепи, получаем дифференциальное уравнение RLC-контура: L(d^2I/dt^2) + R(dI/dt) + I/C = 0 где I — ток в контуре. Это уравнение описывает затухающие колебания в контуре. 6. Затухающими колебаниями называют такие колебания, амплитуда которых со временем уменьшается из-за диссипации энергии (обычно в виде тепла). Логарифмический декремент затухания определяется как натуральный логарифм отношения двух последовательных амплитуд колебаний в одном и том же направлении: δ = ln(A_n/A_{n+1}) где A_n и A_{n+1} — амплитуды двух последовательных колебаний. Физический смысл логарифмического декремента заключается в оценке скорости затухания колебаний в системе. 7. Собственная частота контура ω_0 выражается через параметры контура (индуктивность L и ёмкость C): ω_0 = 1/√(LC) Частота затухающих колебаний ω слегка меньше собственной частоты из-за наличия затухания (активного сопротивления R): ω = √(ω_0^2 - (R/2L)^2) 8. Период затухающих колебаний T для RLC-контура определяется как: T = 2π/ω где ω — частота затухающих колебаний. 9. Добротность Q контура обратно пропорциональна логарифмическому декременту затухания δ и определяется как: Q = π/δ Добротность характеризует \\"качество\\" колебательной системы и её способность сопротивляться затуханию. 10. В случае электромагнитных колебаний в идеальном LC-контуре без активного сопротивления сдвиг фаз между током и напряжением равен 90° (ток опережает напряжение на π/2 или π радиан). Если же в контуре присутствует активное сопротивление R, сдвиг фаз будет отличаться от 90° и зависеть от соотношения между реактивными сопротивлениями и активным сопротивлением."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The name itself can be broken down into two parts: \\"pirarucu\\" and \\"de casaca.\\" - Pirarucu: This is the name of a fish species native to the Amazon Basin, also known by the scientific name Arapaima gigas. It is one of the largest freshwater fish in the world and is a significant part of local cuisine due to its size and its firm, flavorful meat. Pirarucu is a staple protein in various Amazonian dishes. - De casaca: The term \\"de casaca\\" literally translates to \\"in coat\\" or \\"in dress jacket\\" from Portuguese, which metaphorically alludes to something being dressed up or made fancy. In the context of the dish, it implies that the pirarucu fish is prepared in a special or elaborate way. Putting it together, \\"Pirarucu de casaca\\" refers to a dish in which the pirarucu fish is prepared with a mixture of ingredients that might include bread or manioc flour, eggs, bananas, nuts, olives, and spices, among others. This concoction is typically baked and results in a rich, layered dish that is both festive and flavorful, reflecting the local tastes and the biodiversity of the Amazon. It is considered a delicacy and often served on special occasions. The \\"casaca\\" in the name suggests the celebratory and sumptuous nature of the preparation, much like dressing up for an important event."},{"instruction":"could you give me some examples for \\"de casaca\\"","output":"The term \\"de casaca\\" is not widely used in many contexts outside of the phrase \\"pirarucu de casaca.\\" Literally translated from Portuguese, \\"de casaca\\" means \\"in a tailcoat\\" or \\"in a dress coat,\\" which is a type of formal jacket worn by men on very formal, ceremonial occasions. In English, the closest equivalent would be \\"dressed to the nines\\" or \\"in full dress.\\" Given the literal meaning, \\"de casaca\\" implies dressing in a very elegant and sophisticated manner. Here are some examples demonstrating how \\"de casaca\\" could be used metaphorically in Brazilian Portuguese, representing formality or sophistication: 1. **Gala Events**: When men are required to wear a tailcoat or a tuxedo. - Example: Ele foi ao baile de gala de casaca. (He went to the gala ball in a tailcoat.) 2. **Metaphorical Use**: - Example: Vamos preparar a mesa de jantar de casaca hoje, com toda a porcelana e os talheres de prata. (Let's prepare the dinner table in full dress today, with all the porcelain and silverware.) - This means setting up the table very formally, as if the dinner itself were a very formal event. 3. **In Idioms or Phrases**: It could be used in expressions where elegance or refinement is meant. - Example: A apresentação do mágico foi de casaca, deixando todos impressionados. (The magician's performance was 'tailcoat-worthy', leaving everyone impressed.) - Here, \\"de casaca\\" is used to denote that the performance was of a very high quality and impressively formal or elaborate. 4. **In Music or Art Performances**: When performers dress formally for a classical concert or an opera. - Example: Os músicos estavam todos de casaca para o concerto de abertura da temporada. (The musicians were all in tails for the opening concert of the season.) Please note that \\"de casaca\\" is not often used in everyday Portuguese conversations but rather in specific contexts that involve formality, elegance, and special occasions. The association with such \\"dressed up\\" events explains the name of the dish \\"pirarucu de casaca,\\" which refers to an elaborate and special way of preparing the fish."},{"instruction":"and how could it translate it inot spanish, give me three options the term \\"pirarucu de casaca\\"","output":"Translating \\"pirarucu de casaca\\" into Spanish presents a particular challenge because \\"pirarucu\\" is the name of a fish specific to the Amazon Basin and \\"de casaca\\" conveys a cultural concept that might not directly translate into Spanish culinary terms. However, I can suggest some translations that try to preserve the meaning of the dish: 1. **Pirarucú a la casaca**: This is a direct translation, where \\"pirarucú\\" retains its original name, as it might be recognized by Spanish-speaking communities familiar with Amazonian fish, and \\"a la\\" is the Spanish equivalent of \\"à la\\" in French, often used in culinary contexts to describe the style of preparation. 2. **Pirarucú elegante**: Here, \\"elegante\\" replaces \\"de casaca\\" to convey the idea of an elegant, sophisticated preparation of the fish, which is analogous to someone dressing up in a formal coat or \\"casaca.\\" 3. **Pirarucú enchaquetado**: This term uses \\"enchaquetado\\" from \\"chaqueta,\\" which means \\"jacket\\" in Spanish. \\"Enchaquetado\\" here metaphorically implies that the fish is being presented in a fancy, elaborate way, similar to someone wearing a formal jacket. Remember that these translations are attempts to capture the essence of the term rather than direct linguistic equivalents, as the original name carries specific cultural and culinary nuances. If the terminology is used in a Spanish-speaking region, it may require further explanation to convey the full concept to those who are not familiar with Amazonian cuisine."},{"instruction":"what is that cultural concept of \\"de casaca\\"","output":"The cultural concept of \\"de casaca\\" in the Brazilian context, particularly when referring to the dish \\"pirarucu de casaca,\\" carries the connotation of sophistication, formality, and special occasion. \\"Casaca\\" in Portuguese literally refers to a dress coat or tailcoat, a piece of formal attire traditionally worn in very elegant and ceremonial settings. When \\"de casaca\\" is used metaphorically in the context of food, it suggests that the dish is prepared with an extra level of care, complexity, and presentation—much like going the extra mile in dressing up for a grand event. The dish itself becomes a culinary representation of festivity and grandeur that you might associate with someone wearing their formal \\"casaca\\" to a gala or an opera. In other words, the concept of \\"de casaca\\" embodies the idea of transforming something ordinary into something extraordinary through elaborate preparation and presentation.

infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instrument. Here's a breakdown of the information: # Comment Information: - Sample Name: 89-069_GBC_びん内異物 (presumably a sample id or name, possibly indicating a product batch or a sample from within a bottle, labeled as an \\"internal impurity\\" or \\"foreign object in a bottle\\") - Comments: None provided. - Measured by: No name provided. - Affiliation: None provided. - Company: Ishizuka Glass Co., Ltd. # Data Information: - Created on: March 5, 2024, at 11:02 AM - Data Type: Equally spaced data - Horizontal Axis: Wavenumber in units of inverse centimeters (cm-1) - Vertical Axis: Absorbance (Abs) - Start: 649.893 cm-1 - End: 4000.6 cm-1 - Data Interval: 0.964233 cm-1 - Number of Data Points: 3476 # Measurement Information: - Instrument Model: FT/IR-6100typeA - Serial Number: A060461020 - Measurement Date and Time: March 5, 2024, at 10:56 AM - Source: Standard light source - Detector: TGS (triglycine sulfate detector) - Number of Scans: 40 - Resolution: 4 cm-1 - Zero Filling: On - Apodization: Cosine - Gain: Auto (8) - Aperture: Auto (7.1 mm) - Scanning Speed: Auto (2 mm/sec) - Filter: Auto (10000 Hz) The extended information also includes spectrum data in the format of wavenumber, followed by the absorbance value. This spectrum would show how the sample absorbs infrared light at different wavenumbers (frequencies), which can be used to identify the molecular structure or the presence of specific compounds within the sample. FTIR spectroscopy is an analytical technique commonly used to identify organic, polymeric, and in some cases, inorganic materials. The metadata indicates that this particular measurement was configured with automated settings for many parameters such as gain, aperture, scanning speed, and filter. The instrument performed 40 scans to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, and data was collected at a resolution of 4 cm-1, which is indicative of the sharpness or clarity of peaks in the spectrum. The purpose of this specific measurement is to analyze a foreign object found inside a bottle, possibly as a part of quality control or failure analysis for Ishizuka Glass Co., Ltd. The spectrum data provided is only a part of the full dataset, as it typically includes thousands of data points, with each point representing a specific wavenumber and the corresponding absorbance level. If a full analysis is needed, one would look at the absorbance peaks in the spectrum and compare them against a reference library of spectra to identify the material or substances that constitute the foreign object."},{"instruction":"FT-IRデータより、吸光度のピークを探してください。","output":"FT-IRスペクトルデータから吸光度(Absorbance)のピークを見つけるには、波数(Wavenumber)に対する吸光度の値をプロットして、吸光度が局所的に最大になる波数のポイントを探します。ピークは、分析している物質の特定の化学結合や官能基が特定の波長で光を吸収することで現れます。 提示されたデータはテキストベースなので、ここでは手作業で最大吸光度とその波数を探すことになります。ただし、実際には、FT-IRデータは通常、専門のソフトウェアを用いて分析されます。ソフトウェアは自動的にスペクトルをプロットし、ピークを検出してその特性を評価する機能を持っています。 ここでの断片的なデータでは最大吸光度は次のように見えます： - LASTX, 4000.6047 - MAXY, 0.08340 これは、最も吸光度が高いピークが0.08340の吸光度で観測されていることを意味しますが、具体的にどの波数でこのピークが発生しているかは提示されたデータからは確定できません。完全なデータセットをソフトウェアに読み込ませれば、どの波数で吸光度のピークがあるのかを正確に判定できます。 手元にプロットするツールやソフトウェアがある場合は、XYデータ（波数と吸光度）を使用してグラフを作成し、最大点（ピーク）を視覚的に特定することができます。プログラミングが可能であれば、PythonのMatplotlibやPandasのようなライブラリを使ってデータをプロットし、ピークを識別するスクリプトを書くことも一つの方法です。"},{"instruction":"以下python代码报错： (rPPG1) C:UsersadminDesktop>python hx4.py C:Usersadmin.condaenvsrPPG1libsite-packagesnumpycorefromnumeric.py:3504: RuntimeWarning: Mean of empty slice. return _methods._mean(a, axis=axis, dtype=dtype, C:Usersadmin.condaenvsrPPG1libsite-packagesnumpycore_methods.py:129: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in scalar divide ret = ret.dtype.type(ret / rcount) Breathe rate: 0 times/minute Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"C:UsersadminDesktophx4.py\\", line 115, in <module> print(f\\"Video stability ratio: {stability_ratio:.2%}\\") NameError: name 'stability_ratio' is not defined python源码： import cv2 import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.signal import butter, lfilter from skimage.segmentation import slic import os #

在每个索引上都是空的，这表明在前面的帧中并没有找到边缘像素。 重点需要解决的是\`edges_bool\`总是空的问题。在\`edges_bool\`为空，因此得不到任何有效的平均像素强度值，导致\`rr_rate\`为空数组。为了解决这个问题，我们需要检查计算\`edges_bool\`的代码。 在您提供的原始代码片段中，\`edges_bool\`是通过以下方式计算的：

如果你确认了\`edges_bool\`由于某种原因总是空的，你可能需要重新审视你的超像素分割（\`slic\`函数的使用方式）以及后续计算\`edges_bool\`的逻辑。确保你的超像素分割产生了有效的结果，并且边缘确实被检测到。这可能需要你调整\`segments = slic(...)\`中的参数或者检查\`ff\`是否为期望中的图像区域。 一旦\`edges_bool\`被成功计算并包含\`True\`值，循环中的\`np.mean(f[edges_bool])\`就会产生非空的结果，并且\`rr_rate\`也不会为空，最终你会得到非空的\`rr_rate_filtered\`。"},{"instruction":"新的打印加在哪里，说清楚些","output":"好的，请在计算 \`edges_bool\`

Group the data by both \`session_id\` and \`step\`. 2. Subtract the timestamp of the previous step from the current one to get the time consumed for each step. 3. Group the data by \`step\` and calculate the average of the time consumed. Here's an example code using Python and pandas: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Create a DataFrame for the session data data = { 'session_id': [1001, 1002, 1001], 'step': [1, 1, 2], 'timestamp': [100, 200, 150] } # Create a DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Sort the table by session_id then by timestamp df_sorted = df.sort_values(by=['session_id', 'timestamp']) # Group by session_id and use diff to calculate the consumed time for each step df_sorted['time_diff'] = df_sorted.groupby('session_id')['timestamp'].diff() # Calculate the average consumed time for each step, excluding the first step of each session avg_time_per_step = df_sorted.groupby('step')['time_diff'].mean().dropna() print('Average consumed time per step:') print(avg_time_per_step) \`\`\` Note that this approach assumes that the data is already sorted by \`session_id\` and \`timestamp\`. If this is not the case, you should sort the DataFrame as shown in the code above. This example also assumes that you want to exclude the first step's timestamp from the calculation as there isn't a previous timestamp to compare it against to calculate a time difference. If you had timestamps for when sessions start, you should include those to get the duration of the first step. The \`.dropna()\` method excludes the \`NaN\` values which result from the lack of a previous step for the first step of each session. The output of the code is the average consumed time per step. Since the provided data has only one entry for the second step and none of the sessions reach step 3, the average for step 2 would be based on just one session.

Here's your complete code with the added functionality of including step 1 in the average time calculation: \`\`\`python from collections import defaultdict # Initialize a list to store the example data session_data = [ [1001, 1, 100], [1002, 1, 200], [1001, 2, 150], [1002, 2, 300], [1002, 3, 700], ] # Function to calculate the average time per step def calculate_avg_time_per_step(data): steps_duration = defaultdict(list) # Temporary storage for session start times session_start_times = {} previous_step = {} # Sort events by session_id and timestamp to ensure sequential processing data.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[2])) for session_id, step_id, timestamp in data: if step_id == 1: # For the first step in each session, there’s no “previous” step so treat it as the start of the session session_start_times[session_id] = timestamp steps_duration[step_id].append(0) # Assuming a duration of 0 for the initial step else: # Calculate the step duration and save it step_duration = timestamp - session_start_times[session_id] steps_duration[step_id].append(step_duration) # Update the last action time with the current action session_start_times[session_id] = timestamp # Calculate the average time for each step avg_time_per_step = {step: sum(durations) / len(durations) for step, durations in steps_duration.items()} return avg_time_per_step # Call the function to calculate the average time per step average_times = calculate_avg_time_per_step(session_data) # Print the results for step, time in average_times.items(): print(f\\"Step {step} has an average duration of {time:.2f} units.\\") \`\`\` This revised version assumes an instantaneous duration for the first step (\`steps_duration[step_id].append(0)\`). The output now includes step 1 with an average duration of 0 units, as there's no prior step to compare to for calculating its duration. If you have additional data such as initial session start timestamps that aren't part of the steps, you could modify this code to account for that timing as well."},{"instruction":"Привет, чат!

Abrahm, a seasoned scavenger with eyes sharp as the shards he sifts through, stands at the edge of a bustling marketplace in the Watson District. It's a place where tech and flesh intertwine, and where fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an augmented eye. The street is alive with vendors hawking cyberware, black-market software, and contraband from the Corporate Wars. Abrahm knows the game all too well; every step can lead to riches or ruin in this concrete jungle. A contact he's worked with before — a netrunner named Silk, who possesses an uncanny ability to trace untraceable items — has tipped him off to a hot lead. Something big is going down tonight, and there's eddies to be made for those bold enough to reach out and take them. NPCs: 1. Silk — The netrunner with a silver tongue. His secret: he's on the run from a corp hit squad after a failed data heist. 2. Jax — A fixer who's seen better days. Known for his network of informants. His secret: he's skimming off the top of each deal he arranges. 3. Tasha — A ripperdoc operating out of a dingy back-alley clinic. Her secret: her cyberware modifications have a unique signature traceable to her — a fact she guards closely. Abrahm's starting location is a makeshift shelter under the intertwining overpasses of Watson, a grim testament to resilience against Night City's crushing indifference. As a scavenger, he's adept at finding treasure in other people's trash. But the real prize is in the data, the circuitry, and the secrets they hold.

Scrums of cheering girls, bedecked in the school's proud colours of navy and gold, clustered around her, their breath misting the air. The sounds of laughter, wild shouts, and the rhythmical thud of rugby boots against the soil permeated the atmosphere. Amongst this riot of excitement, Lucia felt an odd mixture of anxiety and admiration. Only last term, she had been attending a staid school where the notion of girls tumbling in the mud in pursuit of an oval ball would have caused a scandal. But here at St. Hilda’s, such activities were far more than acceptable; they were celebrated. Next to Lucia, her new friend Georgie, with wind-tousled hair and a beaming smile, was explaining the ebbs and flows of the game as the senior girls battled it out against their rivals from Wentworth Academy. \\"You see, Lucia, the key is to use the whole of your body in a tackle, not just your arms,\\" Georgie said, her eyes fixed on a particularly fierce maul over the ball. \\"Like what Meg’s about to do—watch!\\" Lucia saw Meg, the formidable prop, dig her boots into the soft, yielding earth before launching herself at an incoming Wentworth player. The contact was monumental, a clash of determination and muscle that left both players slipping and sliding in the mud. The crowd roared as the ball squirted out behind the scrum and was swiftly picked up by St. Hilda's nippy scrum-half, who darted forward, her bare legs already streaked with mud. She weaved through the heavier players with an elegance that made Lucia's heart leap. These girls were powerful, like mythical warriors undaunted by the earth that now painted them. \\"And there she goes!” Georgie exclaimed as the scrum-half hurtled toward the try line. \\"Come on, Sarah!\\" In a split second, the crowd's cheers crescendoed as Sarah dived over the line, arms outstretched to ground the ball. A small wave of mud splashed upon impact, marking her triumph with a muddy cap all over her back and shoulders. As Lucia clapped, trying her best to feel the same elation that flowed through her new friends at St. Hilda’s, a part of her remained detached, an observer to this foreign revelry in the rain and filth. \\"These girls are fierce,\\" Lucia remarked, a touch of awe seeping into her tone. Georgie laughed heartily, the pride evident on her mud-spattered face. “That’s St. Hilda’s for you! Wait till you start playing. There’s nothing quite like a scrappy game in the mud. It’s the best part!\\" Georgie’s eyes were alive with mischief as she added, \\"Imagine tomorrow's games lesson—you’re going to be caked in mud from head to toe. It's a rite of passage!\\" Lucia managed a hesitant smile. The idea of being covered in cold, wet mud was not as thrilling to her as it was to Georgie. Her apprehension must have been clear because Georgie nudged her gently with a supportive elbow. \\"You'll do great. It's all in good fun, and we all help each other out. The mud washes off, but the memories last forever.\\" As the girls trudged back to the changing rooms, Lucia watched them, their camaraderie unbroken despite the grueling match. Their jerseys were no longer pristine, adorned with nature's badge of courage. Lucia admired their disregard for cleanliness in the sport they cherished. For a fleeting moment, the seed of excitement, a tiny desire to be part of this gritty sisterhood, planted itself in Lucia's heart. Perhaps, she thought, there was something exhilarating about hurling oneself into the muck of it all—playing hard, laughing harder. Maybe by tomorrow’s lesson, she would find some joy in the rough and tumble of rugby at St. Hilda's after all."},{"instruction":"please write an early chapter about lucias first really muddy games lesson. the games mistress subtly picks exercises which dont just teach the girls - especially lucia, who is not as used to it as everyone else - game skills but encourage them to embrace getting really dirty as they play.","output":"Chapter 3: Embracing the Mud Lucia was still new to St. Hilda's, and her reluctance to embrace the muddy embrace of rugby had not yet faded. It was the morning of her first really muddy Games lesson, and the clouds hung low, promising more rain. The field was already a quagmire from the previous day's downpour, and the sight of it made Lucia's stomach churn. The girls were all kitted out in their navy shorts and jerseys, knees and elbows bare, the anticipation of the upcoming mud bath evident in their boisterous attitudes. Lucia, standing amongst them in her crisp, too-new kit, felt very much the outlier. Miss Thompson, the Games Mistress with a reputation for her boundless enthusiasm and mud-splattered tracksuits, greeted them with a wide, infectious grin. \\"Right, girls! Today is the perfect day to sharpen our skills, and there's no better teacher than our friend here,\\" she said, motioning to the soggy ground beneath their feet. \\"Mud teaches us to be adaptable, to find our footing and balance, even when the going gets tough.\\" The girls whooped as Miss Thompson set out the cones for their first exercise—a zigzag slalom through the muddiest parts of the pitch. \\"As you weave through the cones, I want you to stay low and keep your feet moving fast,\\" instructed Miss Thompson. \\"This will help your stability, and if you fall, well, that's all part of the fun!\\" Lucia watched as one by one, her classmates launched themselves into the exercise. Some managed to stay upright, while others slipped, creating great splatters of mud as they fell and got back up with laughter etched on their faces. Lucia's heart thumped as her turn approached. Remembering Miss Thompson's words, she tried to focus on the task, not the grime. She darted forward, her feet slipping and sliding, each step sending splashes of mud onto her legs. As she rounded the third cone, her balance gave way, and with a squelch, she landed on her side, the earth cold and clinging against her skin. To her surprise, instead of embarrassment, a genuine laugh bubbled up from within her. She got back up, and with a shrug and a smile, continued. By the time she finished, she was as splattered and streaked with mud as everyone else, and for the first time, it felt strangely liberating. The lesson continued with tackling drills. Miss Thompson paired Lucia up with a girl who was more experienced but of similar build. \\"When you tackle, you get close to the ground,\\" Miss Thompson said. \\"Drive through your opponent, and don't be afraid to get down and dirty. It's all about control and using the conditions to your advantage.\\" Lucia eyed the sodden earth. \\"Down and dirty\\" was exactly where they were headed. With a determined breath, she faced her partner, who came at her with the ball. Mustering all her will, she remembered the techniques and wrapped her arms around the other girl, bringing them both down into a dramatic splash of mud. They were grinning ear to ear, their faces painted with the gritty badges of their effort. As the lesson wore on, each activity left the girls more caked in mud—their hair matt, their faces streaked, and their kits far from recognizable. They practiced rucks and mauls, and with each scrimmage, Lucia found herself caring less about the mess and more about the thrill of the game. By the time Miss Thompson called them in to warm showers and clean towels, Lucia's initial apprehension had transformed into exuberant exhaustion. She was messy, muddy, and utterly spent in the best possible way. \\"Great effort, Lucia!\\" said Miss Thompson, giving her an approving nod. \\"You're really embracing the spirit of the game.\\" As they trudged off the pitch, Lucia felt a sense of camaraderie with her peers that only shared trials and mud baths could forge. She realized that it wasn't just the game she was learning—it was also the joy of letting go and the understanding that getting muddy wasn't just inevitable, it was part of the charm of St. Hilda's rugby."},{"instruction":"please write about lucia and her friends bantering in the changing room afterwards. they laugh, joke, tease and boast about just how muddy they got. show their love for the game, especially the chance to get muddy.

The air was thick with the earthy scent of the outdoors, and the tiled floors quickly became a testament to the spirited rugby lesson they'd just had. Lucia, no longer the pristine newcomer but now just as mucky as the rest, found herself amidst the ruckus, a smile wide on her face. The hesitancy she felt earlier had been washed away, replaced by a newfound delight in her muddy accomplishments. \\"I reckon I could plant a garden with the amount of mud I've rinsed off!\\" Georgie announced, flicking a chunk of wet earth from her forearm. \\"Yeah, if you planted anything, it'd be a full crop of bruises,\\" retorted Imogen, her own collection of muddied smears across her face making her look like a warrior after battle. Lucia laughed, turning to see her reflection in the mirror. She could hardly recognize herself under the layers of mud. \\"I must say, I never thought I'd be comparing mud splashes, but I think I might be a contender for the muddiest,\\" she joked, holding out her arms for inspection. An impish grin spread across Georgie's face. \\"Contender? Maybe, but you're not taking my crown, Lucia. They’ll need an archaeological dig to uncover the original color of my kit.\\" The room erupted into merry cheers, confirming Georgie's unofficial yet undisputed title as queen of the mud for the day. Meanwhile, Bella, one of the more agile players, looked suspiciously clean, save for a small smudge on her cheek. \\"Oi, Bella, did you play tag with the mud or rugby?\\" teased Emily, pointing at Bella's almost immaculate state. \\"I can't help it if I'm just too quick for the mud to catch me,\\" Bella responded with a cheeky wink, eliciting a round of playful groans from the girls. \\"Alright, enough about the mud dodger,\\" said Georgie, turning back to Lucia with a playful nudge. \\"Lucia, you dove into these games headfirst. Quite literally. That tackle you made looked like you were trying to dig to the other side of the world!\\" Lucia, still untying her mud-caked boots, joined in the laughter. \\"I figured if I'm going to learn rugby, I might as well learn it all the way. And apparently, that includes geology.\\" The jibes and jests continued as the girls peeled off their soiled uniforms, leaving a mosaic of navy and gold in the wake of their banter. Under the hot streams of the showers, the stories of the day's spills, thrills, and glory echoed off the tiles, each girl washing away the grime but never the memory of the joy found on a muddy rugby pitch. As the warm water ran over her, Lucia reflected on the transformation she had undergone in just one lesson. A flicker of excitement for the next muddy adventure on the field stirred within her. It was more than just a game; it was about friendship, laughter, and the shared love for momentous tackles and those glorious, muddy dives."},{"instruction":"please describe lucia taking part in a practice scrum during a games lesson. describe the liquid mud splashing around the girls boots as they push and shove. some of the girls pick up fresh smears of mud on their faces from shoving their heads between the muddy bodies of their teammates. lucia starts to think the forwards have the most fun because they get so much muddier than the backs.","output":"Chapter 8: The Heart of the Scrum Under a brooding sky that promised yet another bout of rain, the St. Hilda's rugby pitch had transformed into a veritable swamp, a playground for those who found joy in the grittier aspects of the sport.

Work together as one unit!\\" Lucia could feel the cool, slick muck under her boots as she squared her shoulders, ready to engage. She slid her feet back, the soles of her boots making squelching sounds as she searched for solid ground. The mud, however, had a will of its own; it slipped and slid, oozing between her cleats as she tried to find traction. On the cue, the forwards bent down and interlocked with their teammates, their heads slotting in beside the muddy hips of the girls beside them. Lucia tucked her head in, her cheek brushing against a mud-smeared thigh, and felt a fresh smear of thick, liquid earth adorn her face. She grimaced slightly at the sensation, but the thrill of the push, the heart of the game, surged within her. \\"One... two... three... PUSH!\\" Miss Thompson's voice cut through the sharp, damp air. With a collective grunt, the eight girls surged against their opponents, the weight of their bodies pressing down into the churned-up earth. The scrum was a tangle of maroon and navy jerseys, all strained against the pull of the mud. Lucia bent her knees and pushed with all her might. The ground beneath her seemed to liquefy further with the force, and waves of muddy water splashed around their boots. Her arms trembled with exertion; her breath came out in foggy puffs that mingled with the misty air. She could hear the cheerful exhortations from the backs, urging them on, but at that moment, Lucia felt like she was part of a secret club—the forwards, whose reward for the battle was to be the muddiest of all. Each shove sent more mud flying, decorating them with wild, earthen patterns. As the scrum collapsed and the ball was kicked out to the backs, Lucia straightened up, panting and laughing. Around her, the other forwards were doing the same, their faces painted with splatters of mud, their jerseys nearly indistinguishable from their darkened shorts. Even their hair, tied back and practical, had strands matted with the rich, brown mud. \\"You know,\\" Lucia said to her scrum mate, Harriet, as they jogged back to position for another go, \\"I think the forwards have the most fun in this game.\\" Harriet, wiping a clump of mud off her eyebrow, grinned. \\"Oh, without question. The backs might get the glory when they sprint for the try line, but look at us—this,\\" she gestured to the mud caking them both, \\"is the real heart of rugby. It's where the game is truly won.\\" Lucia nodded in agreement, feeling the peculiar pride that came with being at the center of the maelstrom of muck and muscle. She pictured the next scrum, the next charge, the next wild dance with the sodden earth, and she realized that this—this mad, muddy melee—was fast becoming her favorite part of the game."},{"instruction":"В коммутаторе HP ProCurve есть Vlan2 со следующими параметрами: untagged 45 tagged 48 Что это значит?","output":"В коммутаторе HP ProCurve настройки VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) определяют, как трафик классифицируется и перемещается через различные порты коммутатора.

Satellite connections often have higher latency and can be more prone to packet loss compared to terrestrial connections due to the long distances the signals must travel (approximately 36,000 kilometers to geostationary satellites and back to Earth), and due to the signals having to pass through various atmospheric layers which can cause signal degradation, especially during adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain or storms—a phenomenon known as rain fade. A well-functioning satellite connection under normal conditions may exhibit packet loss rates similar to other wireless systems, potentially in the range of 1-3%. However, during periods of heavy congestion or significant atmospheric disturbances, packet loss on satellite links can spike significantly higher, possibly to 10% or more. It's important to note that these figures can vary dramatically based on the specific conditions and the technology in use. Satellite network operators may use various techniques to mitigate packet loss, such as implementing advanced error correction codes, automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols, and adapting modulation and coding schemes to current link conditions in order to maintain a more stable connection. For real-time applications such as voice over IP (VoIP) or video conferencing, even a small amount of packet loss (e.g., 1-2%) could be noticeable in terms of quality degradation, whereas some other applications like file downloads can tolerate higher packet loss because of retransmission mechanisms built into protocols like TCP. For mission-critical applications or services that require very reliable satellite communication, such as military or maritime communications, specialized satellite technologies and robust network designs are employed to minimize packet loss as much as possible."},{"instruction":"What’s tcp packet recording percentage range could be in satellite connection?","output":"There might be a misunderstanding in the question as \\"TCP packet recording percentage\\" isn't a standard term or metric in network communications. However, it seems like you may be inquiring about packet recovery rather than recording. Packet recovery refers to the percentage of lost packets that are successfully retransmitted and received in TCP communications. In Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), packet loss is addressed through retransmissions. When a TCP sender transmits a segment, it starts a timer and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver. If the ACK is not received within the timeout period, the sender assumes that the packet was lost and retransmits it. The TCP receiver sends an acknowledgment back to the sender once it has successfully received and processed a packet. For satellite connections, the recovery of lost packets is typical in the protocol's operation due to its mechanism to deal with packet loss. In a well-tuned TCP connection over satellite, the recovery rate should be close to 100% under normal conditions, as TCP is designed to be a reliable transport layer protocol. This means if a packet is lost, the TCP protocol will continue trying to retransmit until the packet is successfully delivered or the connection is reset due to too many failed attempts or a timeout. However, the high latency and variable conditions of satellite links can challenge TCP's ability to efficiently recover lost packets. The retransmission timeouts (RTOs) might need to be adjusted to suit the longer round-trip times (RTTs) characteristic of satellite communication. Techniques like Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs) and larger TCP window sizes can be used to cope better with the long delay and potential for higher packet loss rates. The specific recovery rate would also depend on the quality of the link, current network conditions, and the configuration of the TCP stack. It's important to remember that while TCP will attempt to recover all lost packets, actual recovery percentages can be affected by various factors, including link quality and network congestion."},{"instruction":"I am about packets that was received not in order trey was sent.","output":"Thank you for clarifying; it seems you are asking about the percentage of TCP packets received out-of-order in a satellite connection. Out-of-order packet delivery can occur in any network, including satellite links, due to various factors such as: 1. Varying path delays: Packets may take different routes if there's a network topology change or congestion along the path, causing some packets to arrive later than others. 2. Reordering by network devices: Intermediate routers and switches may process packets at slightly different speeds, especially if load balancing is in use. 3. Retransmissions due to loss: When packets are lost and retransmitted, the retransmitted packets can arrive later than packets sent subsequently. 4. Multipath propagation: In satellite communications, signals can take different paths (e.g., due to reflection or refraction), which can cause packets to arrive at different times. In a typical terrestrial TCP/IP network, out-of-order packet delivery is relatively low, often well below 1%. However, in satellite communications, the percentage of out-of-order packets may be higher due to the reasons mentioned above. This is compounded by the high latency inherent to satellite links, which can exacerbate the issue. There isn't a specific \\"standard\\" range for out-of-order packets percentage because it's highly dependent on the quality of the communication link, the protocols used to mitigate the satellite link's particularities (like specialized TCP accelerators or performance-enhancing proxies), and the network's overall congestion state. Despite this variability, under normal conditions, networks are designed to minimize out-of-order packets, and even on satellite links, out-of-order packets are generally an exception rather than the rule. When packets do arrive out of order, TCP has mechanisms to handle them, such as resequencing buffers where the packets can be held and sorted before they are passed to the application layer in the correct order. In a well-configured satellite TCP/IP network, optimizations are put in place to lower the impact of out-of-order packets. These might include larger buffers and TCP window sizes to account for the long round-trip-time (RTT) and using advanced TCP options like Selective Acknowledgements (SACK) to better handle packet loss and reordering. Out-of-order packet percentage is typically not a commonly reported performance metric, and as such, any numerical range given would be a rough estimate. In satellite terms, it's safe to say that the percentage of out-of-order packets would usually be higher than a terrestrial network but should ideally still be low (often below a few percent) with proper network configuration and optimization."},{"instruction":"My question is about its percentage range. Can you estimate it or provide information that you know?","output":"I apologize for misunderstanding your question initially. It's important to highlight that specific statistics regarding out-of-order packet delivery in satellite networks are generally not well-documented in publicly available literature, primarily because out-of-order delivery rates can be highly variable and context-dependent. In general, satellite networks might experience higher rates of out-of-order packets than terrestrial networks due to the long propagation delay, potential for more variable routes through the network, and the likelihood of link layer retransmissions due to error rates. The actual percentage of out-of-order packets could be relatively low, even in satellite networks, but will increase with the severity of the network conditions that cause it. For well-optimized networks, the rate of out-of-order packets might remain below 1%. However, in less optimized or more congested networks, particularly in scenarios with inconsistent routing or multi-path effects, the rate could be several percentage points higher. In practice, without specific telemetry or network measurement tools applied to a particular satellite link under observation, estimating an accurate or typical range is complex. Providers and network engineers may measure out-of-order packet rates as part of their internal quality assurance and performance monitoring but do not always release this data to the public. In satellite networks, advanced error correction, prioritization of traffic, and performance-enhancing proxies are often used to minimize the effects of packets arriving out of order. These tools and protocols can help ensure that applications see fewer disruptions, as they can reassemble the data stream in the proper order before it's passed to higher layers of the network stack. Ultimately, for a precise estimate or range, one would need to consider the specific satellite network setup, including the types of satellites used (geostationary or low earth orbit), the physical environment, network congestion, and the link's current condition. Each of these factors can significantly affect out-of-order packet rates. If you require values for a particular network or scenario, contacting the service provider or conducting network measurements would be necessary."},{"instruction":"What's the ranges for WiFi?","output":"The range of Wi-Fi signals can vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including the Wi-Fi standard being used (e.g., 802.11b/g/n/ac/ax), the frequency band (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz), the power output of the Wi-Fi hardware, the antenna design, and environmental factors such as obstructions, interference, and building materials. Here are some general indoor and outdoor ranges for different Wi-Fi standards: 1. **802.11b/g** (2.4 GHz): - Indoor: Typically up to 35-40 meters (115-130 feet) - Outdoor: Up to 140 meters (460 feet) without obstructions 2. **802.11n**: - Indoor: Up to 70 meters (230 feet) on 2.4 GHz and up to 35 meters (115 feet) on 5 GHz - Outdoor: Over 200 meters (650 feet) on 2.4 GHz under ideal conditions 3. **802.11ac** (5 GHz): - Indoor: Up to 35 meters (115 feet), although range can be significantly less due to the higher frequency's poorer penetration through walls and other structures - Outdoor: Can exceed 100 meters (328 feet) under clear line-of-sight conditions 4. **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**: - Indoor: Similar to 802.11ac due to similar operating frequencies, but improvements in technology can lead to better performance in crowded environments - Outdoor: Similar to 802.11ac, potentially further with the right conditions and equipment For indoor environments, factors like walls, furniture, and other obstructions can attenuate the Wi-Fi signal, reducing its range. Similarly, interference from other electronic devices, including other Wi-Fi networks, can impact the range and performance of a Wi-Fi network. Outdoor ranges are typically longer due to fewer obstructions, but they can be affected by environmental factors such as trees, buildings, and terrain. It's also essential to note that while a device might be able to connect to Wi-Fi at the maximum range, the connection quality and bandwidth typically degrade as distance from the access point increases. This is especially true for the 5 GHz band, which offers faster data rates but has less ability to penetrate solid objects, resulting in a shorter practical range compared to the 2.4 GHz band."},{"instruction":"I am about tcp packet reordering and out-of-order packet percentage range for WiFi.","output":"Apologies for the confusion. Packet reordering and out-of-order packet delivery in a Wi-Fi network may happen due to various factors, such as multi-path propagation, where signals bounce off surfaces and take different paths to the receiver, or due to rapid changes in signal quality that cause the Wi-Fi access point to adjust its transmission rates dynamically. There is no standardized range for out-of-order packet percentages in Wi-Fi networks as this metric is highly situation-dependent. It varies based on network congestion, signal strength, interference from other wireless devices, network hardware, the physical environment, and the Wi-Fi protocols in use. In a relatively interference-free and well-constructed Wi-Fi network, the percentage of out-of-order packets might be quite low, possibly similar to wired networks, with a typical value that could be in the low single digits. However, in more problematic environments with significant interference and weaker signal strength, where packets might need to be retransmitted frequently, the percentage could be higher. The performance of Wi-Fi networks, including packet ordering, has improved with newer standards. For instance, 802.11n, ac (Wi-Fi 5), and ax (Wi-Fi 6) provide better data rates and more reliable performance, even in challenging environments, which can help lower the chance of out-of-order packet delivery. In practice, networks should be designed to minimize the occurrence of out-of-order packets because such conditions can degrade the performance of TCP streams. If the percentage of out-of-order packets is high, it can cause increased latency due to buffer reordering and potential throughput issues since TCP's congestion control mechanisms might interpret out-of-order delivery as a sign of network congestion and respond by slowing down the transmission rate. Quantifying an exact range for out-of-order packets in Wi-Fi networks is challenging without specific empirical data, but for most well-functioning networks, we would expect the number to be low. If more precise data is required, a network administrator would need to collect and analyze network performance statistics using specialized tools and software to monitor and measure packet flow within a specific Wi-Fi network."},{"instruction":"I need the numbers","output":"As mentioned before, there is no one-size-fits-all answer for the percentage of out-of-order packets in Wi-Fi networks due to the myriad variables involved. However, to give some rough numbers, in a well-maintained and non-congested Wi-Fi environment, the percentage of out-of-order packets can be expected to be quite low: - **Optimal Conditions**: Under ideal circumstances with strong signal strength and minimal interference, the out-of-order packet percentage could be below 1%. - **Typical Use**: In typical usage scenarios with some interference from other devices and physical obstructions, the out-of-order packet percentage might range from 1% to 3%. - **High Interference or Poor Conditions**: In environments with significant interference, weak signals, or heavy network traffic, the out-of-order packet percentage could climb higher, potentially ranging between 5% and 10%. Please note that these figures are estimates and can vary widely based on the factors affecting the wireless environment. Additionally, modern Wi-Fi standards and technologies include mechanisms to reduce the impact of out-of-order packets, such as block acknowledgment and frame aggregation in 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4) and later standards, which help enhance overall network reliability. For accurate measurements, you'd have to analyze the specific Wi-Fi network in question using network diagnostics tools that can capture and analyze traffic patterns, such as Wireshark or specialized wireless performance monitoring software. These tools can give you the exact percentage of out-of-order packets over a given time and under specific network loads and conditions."},{"instruction":"Is out of order packet amount correlates with packet loss?","output":"Out-of-order packet delivery can correlate with packet loss in TCP networks, but the two are not equivalent and one does not necessarily directly cause the other. Here's how they can be related: 1. **Symptoms of Similar Problems**: Both out-of-order packet delivery and packet loss can be symptoms of issues such as network congestion, link quality problems, or changes in the network path. For example, if packets are being routed along multiple paths with varying latencies, you might experience both out-of-order packets (due to different travel times) and packet loss (if one path is more prone to errors or congestion). 2. **Retransmissions**: A TCP sender will retransmit a packet if it doesn't receive an acknowledgment within a certain window of time—assuming the packet is lost. These retransmissions can sometimes be received out of order, particularly if the original packet was not actually lost but rather delayed and arrives after its retransmitted copy. 3. **Packet Loss Recovery**: When TCP recovers from packet loss, the reordering of packets can occur. As packets are retransmitted, the order in which they are received by the receiver may not match the order in which they were sent, especially if subsequent packets bypass the delayed ones. 4. **Flow Control and Congestion Avoidance**: Both mechanisms in TCP can be involved when dealing with packet loss and may indirectly affect packet ordering. For instance, TCP's congestion control algorithms may slow down the sending rate after detecting packet loss, which can also temporarily lead to out-of-order packets until the network stabilizes. However, it is also entirely possible to observe out-of-order packets without any actual packet loss: - **Packet Reordering**: Packets can be reordered because of network elements like multi-layer switches performing uneven load balancing or due to different path lengths when packets are routed through a network. In a well-constructed network with minimal interference and congestion, out-of-order packets are typically rare, as are packet losses. In networks with higher latencies, such as satellite communications, or in congested wireless environments, you might see an increase in both out-of-order packet delivery and packet loss. In summary, while there can be a correlation between out-of-order packets and packet loss because both can result from similar network issues, the presence of one does not always indicate the presence of the other. Network engineers often distinguish between these two phenomena when diagnosing and addressing network performance issues."},{"instruction":"I need a percentage of the correlation in different cases, can you give me these numbers?","output":"Determining a specific percentage that represents the correlation between out-of-order packet delivery and packet loss across various cases is challenging without empirical data from real-world networks. The correlation will be affected by the unique conditions and configurations of each network, making it difficult to generalize across different cases with a single set of statistics. However, I can describe different scenarios and discuss how they might influence the relationship between out-of-order packet delivery and packet loss: 1. **High-Quality Wired Networks**: In reliable and well-configured wired networks (such as a corporate LAN), you might experience very low packet loss (close to 0%) and out-of-order packets might also be a rare occurrence. The correlation here could be non-existent or negligible. 2. **Wi-Fi and Other Wireless Networks**: Wireless networks are more prone to interference, which can contribute to both packet loss and out-of-order packets. You might see a low to moderate correlation, depending on the level of signal interference, as mild interference might cause packets to arrive out of order without being lost. 3. **Mobile Networks**: Mobile networks (3G, 4G/LTE, 5G) are highly variable due to factors like user mobility, signal quality, and network congestion. In these networks, out-of-order packet delivery might correlate more strongly with packet loss, particularly in congested or low-signal areas. 4. **Satellite Communications**: Due to the long round-trip times, retransmission delay in case of packet loss might increase the likelihood of out-of-order packets. However, sophisticated error-correction mechanisms are usually in place, and the correlation between packet loss and out-of-order packets may depend heavily on the specific system's design and the external conditions affecting the signal. 5. **High-Performance Networks with Advanced Traffic Management**: Networks that use traffic shaping, load balancing, or advanced routing techniques such as MPLS might experience very low packet loss alongside a very low incidence of out-of-order packets, leading to a low correlation between the two. In summary, the correlation between out-of-order packet delivery and packet loss can vary broadly, and assigning a specific percentage to these correlations would be speculative without concrete data. In practice, precise correlation percentages are determined by network engineers and researchers who conduct thorough analyses on networks using various tools and methodologies to collect data specific to the environment under study. If a reliable percentage is required, it may be necessary to perform targeted network assessments and analyses or to review detailed performance reports provided by networking equipment vendors or research studies conducted in similar settings."},{"instruction":"Can I use kevent function on iPhone?","output":"Yes, you can use the \`kevent\` function on iPhone within the constraints of Apple's APIs available for iOS. The \`kevent\` function is part of the BSD kernel's kqueue event notification mechanism, which is available on iOS as it's based on Darwin, the UNIX-like system that underpins both macOS and iOS. The kqueue/kevent system allows for asynchronous event notifications on various types of objects, including file descriptors, processes, and signals, which can be used to build efficient, non-blocking I/O operations in an application. However, it's essential to understand that while you have access to \`kevent\` and related APIs for development, there are some restrictions on iOS in terms of what you can do with these APIs compared to macOS or other UNIX-like systems. For example, sandboxing on iOS imposes limitations on file system access and inter-process communication, which may restrict how you leverage the \`kevent\` function. To use \`kevent\` on iOS, you would generally be working with network sockets or monitoring local resources that your app has access to adhere to Apple's App Store guidelines and the sandboxing environment of iOS. Lastly, if you're developing for iOS, using higher-level abstractions like Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) or the Network framework might be more appropriate for most use cases. Apple often recommends using these abstractions as they are easier to work with and provide a more \\"Cocoa-like\\" feel while taking advantage of the underlying system capabilities, including kqueue and kevent, in an optimized way. GCD, in particular, provides an easy way to work with asynchronous events and may internally use kqueue for efficiency. In summary, you can use the \`kevent\` function on iPhone, but you should be aware of the iOS environment's limitations and prefer to use higher-level iOS frameworks when possible."},{"instruction":"What's latest version of Darwin? in what year its last update?","output":"As of my last update in early 2023, information about the latest version of Darwin, which is the core operating system that is a subset of macOS and is also shared by iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS, might not be current.

For instance, macOS Big Sur (11.x) was running on Darwin 20, and macOS Monterey (12.x) was based on Darwin 21. The most recent publicly available version of macOS is macOS Ventura, released in October 2022, and it would be based on a newer version of Darwin, likely Darwin 22. Apple doesn't always prominently advertise the version number of Darwin itself, and the updates to Darwin come as part of the updates to macOS. To find the specific version of Darwin running on a Mac: 1. Open the Terminal application. 2. Type the command: \`uname -r\` and press Enter. This will output the release number of the Darwin kernel that's running on the system. The output is typically a set of numbers separated by dots (e.g., 21.4.0). To check the latest version of iOS, you can go to Settings > General > Software Update on an iOS device. Since iOS is based on the same core as macOS, it receives updates in parallel with macOS, and its Darwin core is updated accordingly. For transparency, Apple also releases source code for components of Darwin on its open source website, but the updates here might lag behind the actual releases within macOS or iOS: https://opensource.apple.com/ Please note that this information might be outdated depending on when you are checking.

This includes the source for components like the XNU kernel, Bonjour networking, and other foundational elements of the operating system. For those interested in a Unix-like experience similar to macOS, there are a few paths to explore: 1. **PureDarwin**: PureDarwin is a community project that aims to make a bootable and usable version of the open source components from Darwin. As it strives to be binary compatible with macOS, it uses the same open source components provided by Apple. While the project exists, it may not be up to date with the latest versions, and its usability as an everyday operating system might be limited. You can check their project page for more information and downloads (http://www.puredarwin.org/). 2. **macOS**: If you're interested in the full experience with the graphical user interface, you need to use an actual version of macOS, which is available only on Apple's Mac hardware or in a virtual environment within the terms of Apple's software licensing agreement. 3. **Linux or BSD**: For those who want a free open source UNIX-like system with wider support, Linux or FreeBSD could be an alternative. While not the same as Darwin, they share many Unix principles, utilities, and a similar command-line experience. In summary, while you cannot directly download and install Darwin as a complete, ready-to-use operating system, you can work with the available open source parts, contribute to or experiment with projects like PureDarwin, or choose a related Unix-like operating system for a similar experience."},{"instruction":"Does PureDarwin have sufficient set of drivers?","output":"As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, PureDarwin faced significant challenges in terms of driver support. The PureDarwin project aims to create an operating system from the open source components released by Apple as part of Darwin. However, Apple does not open-source many of the drivers, especially those for specific hardware like graphics cards, network devices, and other peripherals that are used in Mac computers. The lack of these proprietary drivers is a significant hurdle for PureDarwin and any similar projects attempting to create a fully functional system based on Darwin sources. Consequently, PureDarwin may not have a complete set of drivers necessary to support a wide range of hardware. Generic drivers and those that have been open-sourced can be used to provide basic functionality, but advanced features enabled by proprietary drivers on macOS are typically lacking. Driver support for things like advanced graphics acceleration, certain Wi-Fi chipsets, power management, and specialty hardware is usually limited. This can result in PureDarwin being more suitable for experimental purposes or for running on a limited range of hardware with basic capabilities, rather than as a daily driver operating system. For up-to-date information, it would be necessary to check the PureDarwin project's official documentation or repositories to see what progress might have been made regarding driver support. If you're considering using PureDarwin on specific hardware, you should look into the project's community forums or contact contributors to understand the current state of hardware compatibility."},{"instruction":"What lf net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat is 1 and is 0??","output":"The \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` is a Linux kernel parameter that specifies the threshold at which the TCP stack makes a writable callback to the socket layer for transmission queue (\\"not sent queue\\") data that has not yet been sent on the network. This writable callback is used by non-blocking sockets when they have been previously unable to send data (e.g., the send buffer was full). Here's the difference between setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to 1 and to 0: 1. **When \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` is set to 1**: - This means that the kernel will wait until there is at least 1 byte of unsent data in the TCP send queue before it triggers a writable callback. This setting allows for very low latency notifications to the application that it can send more data without necessarily waiting for the whole send buffer to be emptied or the application request for the send buffer's state. The goal is to optimize the application's network throughput by notifying it as soon as it can send additional data, even though it can result in more frequent wake-ups and potentially smaller writes. 2. **When \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` is set to 0**: - The zero value is treated as a special case. When set to 0, it essentially disables the low watermark feature, and the TCP stack will fall back to its standard behavior of notifying the application only when there's a significant amount of space available in the send buffer (by default, when the number of available bytes is greater than or equal to the socket's \`SO_SNDLOWAT\` option, which often defaults to 2048). This reduces the frequency of wakeup events for applications waiting to send data, but it may introduce more latency before an application is notified that it can send more data. Changing the value of \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` can affect the trade-offs between performance (throughput and latency) and application wakeup (CPU utilization). It is generally an advanced setting that should be modified only when you have specific requirements or when tuning the system for particular application behaviors or network characteristics. For applications sensitive to wake-up latency that have their sockets in non-blocking mode or using asynchronous I/O, setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to a low non-zero value can be beneficial. However, for most general use cases, the default value (which is typically treated as disabled) should suffice without needing to alter this parameter."},{"instruction":"Are you sure?","output":"Apologies for the confusion. It looks like I made an error in my explanation. Let's clarify the functionality of the \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` kernel parameter. The \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` parameter, introduced in the Linux kernel, sets a threshold for the number of bytes pending transmission (data written to the socket by the application but not yet acknowledged by the receiver) at which the networking stack should wake up applications polling for write events on the socket. The behavior is as follows: - **When \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` is set to 0**: This effectively disables the feature, and the system will not trigger the writable event based on unacked but not sent data. Instead, it will use the available space in the queue as the trigger. The application will be woken up when there's more room in the send queue. - **When \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` is set to a value greater than 0**: The feature is enabled, and the application will be woken up for sending more data when the amount of outstanding but not yet sent data drops below the configured threshold. For example, setting it to 1 means that if there is at least one byte of capacity in the send queue, the application will be woken up to write more data to the socket. The practical effect of setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to a low positive value is that it can reduce the latency for the application to send data at the cost of potentially more frequent wake-ups, increased CPU usage, and smaller send operations. It can be beneficial for applications that require low-latency network communications. Bear in mind that tuning these parameters should be done carefully, as the specific effect may vary depending on the particular workload and network conditions. It is recommended to perform thorough testing to ensure that any changes to network parameters result in the desired performance improvements without unintended side effects."},{"instruction":"If net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat=1 then if there is 1 unsent byte that the buffer is available for writing?","output":"No, that's incorrect. I apologize for the previous confusion. Let me clarify what \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` represents once more. The \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` parameter is not about the amount of space available in the send buffer, but rather the amount of data that is written to the send buffer by the application but has not yet been sent or is not yet in flight (i.e., data that has not been transmitted or for which the transmission has not yet been confirmed). When \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` is set to a value, such as 1, this indicates the amount of unsent data that must be reached before the write poll (epoll or select call) is woken up. So if you set it to 1: - If there are already unsent bytes equal to or greater than \`tcp_notsent_lowat\`, the application's write poll won't be woken up. - If there are fewer unsent bytes than the value of \`tcp_notsent_lowat\` (i.e., 0 unsent bytes when \`tcp_notsent_lowat\` is set to 1), the application's write poll will be woken up so that it can write more data to the socket. This means that, with \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` set to 1, the kernel will wake up polling on the socket whenever the amount of data that has been queued but not yet sent by TCP falls below this threshold, indicating that the application can send more data without waiting for a large amount of free space to become available. Setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to 1 helps reduce latency for transmitting data at the cost of potentially increased system calls, which could impact CPU usage. However, it should be adjusted according to the needs of the application and after careful consideration since the setting might not be ideal for every scenario."},{"instruction":"If \\"When net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat is set to a value, such as 1, this indicates the amount of unsent data that must be reached before the write poll (epoll or select call) is woken up.

There seems to have been a misunderstanding about the \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` parameter. Let's try to make this clear: The \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` parameter sets the threshold for the number of bytes of not yet sent data in the TCP send queue that will cause the socket to be marked as writable by select(), poll(), epoll(), and similar system calls that check the writability of sockets. Here's what happens when \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` is set to 1: - The system will trigger a writable event (i.e., inform the application that it can write to the socket) when the amount of data in the TCP send queue that has not yet been sent out is less than or equal to the threshold – in this case, 1 byte. This means that if you have \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` set to 1 and your application previously attempted to send data but the TCP send buffer was full, making the socket unwritable at that moment, then as soon as the TCP stack has successfully sent enough data reducing the not-sent queue to 1 byte or less, it will trigger a writable event. Said another way, setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to 1 aims to keep the send queue as empty as possible by waking up the application to write more data almost as soon as any room becomes available. This helps to minimize the amount of unsent data in the queue and can improve latency at the cost of potentially more frequent wake-ups of the application. This setting is useful for applications where low latency is critical and the application needs to send data as soon as possible, such as when small messages are being sent in real-time applications. However, it can also result in increased CPU usage due to more frequent context switches as the application is woken up more often to write data."},{"instruction":"If it triggers on 1, does it mean that I can write to the buffer 1 byte only?","output":"No, a \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` value of 1 does not mean that you can write only one byte to the buffer. Rather, it indicates that the system will notify the application (e.g., wake up a write poll) when there is at least 1 byte of space available in the TCP send buffer for additional data to be written. Here's a simplified explanation: When you perform a non-blocking write on a TCP socket, you may fill up the TCP send buffer. If it becomes full, you can't write more data until space is freed up as the data is sent out over the network and acknowledged by the receiver. Normally, the application would need to wait until a sufficiently large amount of space becomes available before being notified that it can write again. By setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to 1, you're configuring the system to be more aggressive about notifying you when space is available for writing. It means that as soon as the total amount of data queued up but not yet sent is equal to or less than 1 byte, the system will call back the application to write more data to the buffer. The writable event triggered when the unsent data drops to or below the threshold does not tell you how much space is available -- only that space has become available. You can then write more data to the buffer, which can be more than just 1 byte depending on the available space at that time. It is important to remember that typically, when you can write again, you can generally write more than 1 byte because TCP will have made progress in sending the data, thus freeing up a portion of the buffer larger than the \`tcp_notsent_lowat\` threshold. The actual writable space can vary greatly and will depend on how much data the TCP stack has managed to send and have acknowledged since the last write attempt."},{"instruction":"If it if 1 it guarantees that I can write 1 byte, not more, if 100 then 100 is guaranteed?","output":"I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's clarify the behavior of \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\`. Setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to a particular value, whether it's 1 or 100, does not guarantee that exactly that many bytes can be written to the socket's send buffer. Here's what it actually means: When \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` is set to a specific value (say N), it means that the polling mechanism (select, poll, epoll, etc.) will report the socket as writable when the amount of data marked as not sent in the socket's send buffer is less than or equal to N bytes. **What it guarantees**: It guarantees that the application will be notified (the socket will be marked as writable) when the not-sent amount falls at or below this threshold. **What it does not guarantee**: It does not guarantee how much new data the application can write to the send buffer once notified. The writable space may be more than N bytes because between the time the data amount falls below the threshold and the application gets scheduled to write, additional data may have been sent or acknowledged. Therefore: - If \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` is set to 1, it means the application is woken up (notified) to write more data when there is 1 byte or less of data that has been queued in the send buffer but not yet sent. The actual amount of space available for writing may be more than 1 byte. - If \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` is set to 100, the application is woken up when there is 100 bytes or less of data that has been queued but not yet sent. The application could then potentially write more than 100 new bytes to the send buffer depending on how much space is actually available at the time of writing. This setting can be used to prompt an application to write data as soon as some space frees up in the send buffer, potentially optimizing network usage by keeping the pipe full. This can be particularly important for applications requiring low-latency communications. However, the amount it can write will always depend on the actual current size of the send buffer and how much of it is empty."},{"instruction":"If the value is equal to the buffer size, does it mean that the event will trigger when the buffer will be completely free?","output":"Yes, that is correct. If you set \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to a value equal to the size of the TCP socket's send buffer, it effectively means that the system will trigger a writable event when the entire send buffer is empty. In practical terms, this setting would imply that the application's poll or select system call (or other I/O event notification mechanisms like epoll) will be notified that the socket is ready for writing only when all the data previously placed in the send buffer has been successfully sent—or at least handed off to the lower layers for sending—and thus, the send buffer is completely free. However, it's worth noting that normally the send buffer would rarely be entirely free because TCP generally sends out data as it is written to the buffer. It would only be completely empty if: 1. The application has stopped writing data and all the data has been sent and acknowledged. 2. The sending process is being throttled due to a slow receiver, network congestion, or window scaling, and the application has been told to wait before sending more data. If you were to set \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to a value this high, it could potentially result in inefficient use of the network, as the application might not be optimally filling the network pipe. There might be idle time on the network connection where no data is being sent, even though the application has data to send. It is generally recommended to set \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to lower values to allow the application to respond more promptly to available buffer space, especially for applications that are sensitive to network latency and throughput."},{"instruction":"Are you sure?","output":"I apologize for any prior confusion. Let's clarify the functionality of the \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` parameter and its relationship with the TCP socket's send buffer. Setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to a value equivalent to the TCP socket's send buffer size would have the effect of triggering a writable event to the application only when the send buffer is completely clear of unsent data (data that the application has written to the socket but that has not been sent on the network). It's important to distinguish between data that is in the send buffer but has not yet been sent (unsent data), and data that is in the send buffer and is in flight (data that has been handed off for transmission but not yet acknowledged). \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` concerns the former: data that is queued for sending but not yet sent. In practice, setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to the full size of the send buffer is unusual and not typically recommended, as it could delay the writable event until the send buffer is entirely empty of unsent data. This may lead to less efficient usage of the network, as it could introduce unnecessary idle periods while the application waits to be able to write more data to the socket. Optimal network utilization usually involves some amount of data always being queued for sending so that the TCP flow is continuous, avoiding gaps that would otherwise reduce throughput. Setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to a lower value helps ensure a more consistent flow of data onto the network, as the application can continue to add data to the send buffer before it is completely emptied of unsent data. Therefore, it is indeed accurate to state that setting \`net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat\` to the full size of the send buffer will result in writable events corresponding to an empty unsent data buffer. However, it's also essential to understand the implications of such a setting on network performance and application behavior, and why a lower value might be preferable for many use cases."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won't have childish stats because these stats don't interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats, but I’m starting with 10% of Lily’s childish stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Arcanum, a majestic realm where magic dueling is both an art and a competitive sport.

She covertly casts an age alteration spell, the Reversal of Time's March, unbeknownst to you and the judges. Every time you cast a spell, you will regress by 2 years in age and mentality, while Lily will advance by 2 years, bolstering her capabilities. This unique spell interacts not only with your age, impacting your core spellcasting stats, but also inflates your childish stats, which impede the effectiveness of your mature spells.

If she succeeds, not only does she prevent Sapphire from using that spell, but she also gains the full point value assigned to it. Due to her age, Lily's casting of these stolen spells will be considered a simplified version, which somewhat reduces the spell's splendor but not its effect. However, the effectiveness of the spells will be influenced by Lily's increasing age and stats due to the Reversal of Time's March spell. This mechanism ensures that the duel will be dynamic and challenging, as Lily's capability to cast more complex spells grows with each passing round, giving her a closer reach to Sapphire's spell list. Remember, while you as Sapphire select your spells, I, as the narrator, determine Lily’s spells and actions based on the new parameters and our agreed mechanics, as well as calculate the outcome of each spell based on the formulas.

The reduction in your magical stats does impact the spell, but you manage to cast it, earning points for its beauty, innocence, and the sheer determination it represents. Points Awarded for Lustrous Lunar Laughter: 29 * 0.461 ≈ 13.37 (rounded to the nearest whole number, 13 points) Sapphire's final points total for the duel is 122. Now it is Lily's turn, and she is eager to make the most of her last casting. Now 14 years old, possessing the magical potency and wisdom of a true prodigy due to her subterfuge, she carefully selects the last spell to cast. She chooses to imbue her final spell with as much maturity and complexity as she can muster. Lily's Stats after her own age-altering spell (Fifth Cast): - Lily's age after fifth cast: 14 + 2 = 16 years old. - Power: 52.93 * (1 + 0.1 * (16 / 6)) ≈ 113.19 - Control: 52.93 * (1 + 0.1 * (16 / 6)) ≈ 113.19 - Creativity: 52.93 * (1 + 0.1 * (16 / 6)) ≈ 113.19 - Finesse: 52.93 * (1 + 0.1 * (16 / 6)) ≈ 113.19 Given her ample stat resources, Lily decides to cast one of the most mature spells on the list that Sapphire couldn't perform, the Echoes of the Celestial. This spell calls upon the vastness of the cosmos, displaying grandeur and depth well beyond her years. Required Stats for Echoes of the Celestial: - Power: 77 - Control: 88 - Creativity: 92 - Finesse: 82 Lily's stats exceed the necessary thresholds to perform the spell by a considerable margin. She summons the grand cosmos to the dueling field, starry vistas and nebulae unfurling in an awe-inspiring dance overhead. It is a spell of such profound mastery and presence that the judges cannot help but be moved. Points Awarded for Echoes of the Celestial: 55 points Lily's final points total for the duel is 142. As the final round concludes, the magical duel is tallied, and the judges reflect on the performances. Sapphire, you navigated an increasingly complex and stacked challenge with cleverness and strategy, ending with an impressive 122 points. However, Lily's cunning use of magic to tilt the contest in her favor and her exceptional talent have earned her a total of 142 points. The crowd erupts into applause for both contestants—Sapphire, for her remarkable adaptability and tenacity in the face of an unknown challenge, and Lily, for her unexpected ascent from challenger to champion. Though the duel did not end in victory for you, Sapphire, the tales of this event will sing of the brilliance and creativity you exhibited under the most curious and enchanting of circumstances. Your status as a prodigious mage remains well-secured, perhaps now augmented by a newfound humility and a reminder that magic, like life, is ever full of unexpected twists."},{"instruction":"Write this scenario duel as a long story for kids with a lot of dialogue and depict Lily as a villain in a fun way","output":"Once upon a time in the mystical world of Grand Arcanum, there lived a young mage named Sapphire, only sixteen and the reigning champion of magic dueling in the teen division. Known far and wide for her enchanting spellcraft, she inspired many aspiring wizards and witches with her graceful incantations and glamorous displays of magic. One sunny day, a grand event was scheduled at the great dueling arena, where competitors would charm and dazzle judges with the most beautiful spells. Sapphire, adorned in a robe of the deepest blue adorned with twinkling stars, arrived with confidence, ready to defend her title. In the crowd, a peculiar figure caught everyone's eyes—a petite girl, no more than six, with curly golden locks and a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. This was Lily, known to some as a sweet child, but to others, as a tad too clever for her britches. She approached the champion with a challenging stomp of her tiny foot. \\"I challenge thee, Sapphire, Champion of Magic Duels!\\" Lily declared, her voice surprisingly fierce for someone her size. Sapphire raised an eyebrow but smiled warmly. \\"A challenge it is then. May our spells bring joy to the hearts of all who watch,\\" she said, her voice like a melody. As the duel commenced, the mages stood in the center of the arena, wands at the ready. Unbeknownst to Sapphire, Lily quietly, almost silently, whispered an incantation under her breath—a spell of mysterious power that would slowly cause Sapphire to become younger while boosting Lily’s magical strength. In the first round, with a flourish of her wand, Sapphire unveiled the Binding of the Basilisk—a mesmerizing display of light that coiled like a serpent before forming a protective circle. The crowd gasped in awe, but Sapphire felt strange... a tad shorter, and why did her robe seem looser? \\"Very pretty,\\" Lily snickered, now subtly taller. \\"But watch this!\\" With a dramatic wave of her little wand, Lily conjured Blissful Blossom Breeze. Blooms of every color spiraled through the air, and a sweet scent filled the arena. The crowd clapped, enamored by Lily's magic, while Sapphire's head spun with confusion. As the duel progressed, Sapphire, feeling increasingly youthful and battling her growing silliness, bravely chose her next spell: Shimmering Mirage. She waved her wand, and an oasis of sparkling water appeared, complete with palm trees swaying and mirages dancing in the heat. Despite her efforts, the palm trees wobbled and the mirages giggled—odd behavior for a mirage, to be sure. \\"Haha, is that the best you can do, Sapphire?\\" Lily taunted, her voice deeper now and her eyes gleaming with villainous delight. She responded with a flurry of colors in her Gossamer Glitter Gale that impressed the judges. With each spell, Lily became more formidable, and Sapphire more childlike. By the third round, with Sapphire’s spells affected by a growing sense of whimsy and fidgetiness, she courageously cast Crystalline Chorus. Beautiful crystal notes hung in the air, each a pure note, but the song was cut short as Sapphire lost her focus and chased a butterfly that had fluttered through the arena. Lily laughed wickedly, reveling in secret glee at her plan unfolding marvelously. She displayed her burgeoning prowess with Twirling Tendril Tapestries that earned her shouts of delight from the crowd. In a moment of inspiration, Sapphire realized that her once-mighty spells would now be nearly impossible to cast with her child’s mind and body. With cleverness born of true champions, she chose to steal Lily's spell, casting Spiraling Spectrum Sprinkles and harnessing her now-innate childish perspective to bring forth a shower of dazzling, playful light. Though not as strong as she had been, the crowd adored the jubilant display. \\"Cheeky little champion!” Lily cackled, her voice booming with a matured tone. She conjured Whiskerwind Wand Waltz, her magic grander than ever, painting a captivating tale of wands dancing with elegance and precision, further closing the gap in points. In the final act, Sapphire knew she had to capture the essence of innocence. She stole another spell from Lily's list, Lustrous Lunar Laughter, filling the arena with echoes of sweet laughter and delicate moonbeams. Yet the spell felt different—less powerful, more playful—and she hoped it would be enough to win over the judges. Lily, proud and powerful, now almost an adult in stature and skill, decided to unleash a spell of immense beauty. She cast Echoes of the Celestial, summoning celestial bodies that bathed the arena in cosmic grandeur. It was a masterpiece of magic that testified to her cunning plan and remarkable talent, winning her the duel. As the final points were tallied, Sapphire admired Lily's ambition and cleverness despite her tactics. \\"Well done, Lily,\\" Sapphire said with genuine respect. Lily took a grand bow and could not help but grin. \\"Thank you, Sapphire. You were magnificent too!\\" Though she didn’t win, Sapphire found joy in the game and learned that even champions can be surprised. As they left the arena hand in hand, laughter echoed behind them, a reminder that magic duels were about more than just winning—they were about the enchantment and wonder that filled every heart with glee. And so, the tale of Sapphire and Lily became one of the most beloved stories in Grand Arcanum, a tale of challenge, charm, and the playful hearts of two clever mages."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Sin embargo, puedo orientarte en función de factores clave para que puedas hacer tu elección basada en lo que es tendencial y sostenible. Aquí hay algunos criterios a considerar al seleccionar un nicho: 1. **Pasión y Conocimiento:** Es mucho más sencillo y gratificante crear contenido sobre un tema que te apasiona y que conoces bien o tienes interés en aprender. Así, podrás compartir genuinamente tu entusiasmo con tu audiencia. 2. **Demanda de la Audiencia:** Busca un tema que tenga interés entre los espectadores de YouTube. Puedes hacer una investigación de palabras clave para ver qué temas son populares y están siendo buscados. 3. **Competencia:** Mientras que un nicho popular puede parecer atractivo, también viene con mucha competencia. A veces, nichos más pequeños y especializados, también conocidos como \\"micro-nichos\\", pueden ofrecer una mejor oportunidad para destacarse. 4. **Potencial de Monetización:** Considera si el nicho que eliges tiene potencial para ser monetizado a través de publicidad, patrocinios, ventas afiliadas o la venta de tus propios productos o servicios. 5. **Sostenibilidad y Escalabilidad:** Piensa en si el nicho puede proporcionarte suficiente contenido a largo plazo y si puedes aumentar la escala de tu canal con el tiempo. 6. **Impacto y Valor:** Reflexiona sobre cómo tu contenido puede aportar valor a la vida de las personas. Los canales que educan, inspiran, ayudan o entretienen tienden a fomentar una audiencia leal. Basándome en estos criterios, si tuviera que \\"elegir\\" un nicho, optaría por uno que cumpla con la mayoría de estos puntos y que se alinee con las tendencias y necesidades actuales de los usuarios. Por ejemplo, un nicho como la \\"Sostenibilidad y Estilo de Vida Ecológico\\", que combina pasión por el medio ambiente, una audiencia creciente preocupada por el cambio climático, y el potencial para compartir una amplia gama de contenido, desde tips para reducir el desperdicio hasta reseñas de productos sostenibles, podría ser una excelente opción. Es importante recordar que mientras más auténtica y única sea tu voz y tu enfoque dentro del nicho, mayores serán las posibilidades de que tu canal destaque y atraiga a una audiencia comprometida."},{"instruction":"segun los parametros que me dices, cual nicho seria mejor","output":"Elegir el mejor nicho para tu canal de YouTube se reduce a encontrar un equilibrio entre tus intereses personales y las oportunidades del mercado. Basándome en los criterios que te proporcioné antes, aquí está una estrategia paso a paso que podrías usar para determinar cuál sería el mejor nicho para ti: 1. **Lista tus intereses y habilidades:** Anota los temas sobre los cuales eres apasionado o tienes un conocimiento profundo. Esto podría incluir hobbies, áreas de estudio, experiencias de trabajo, o simplemente temas que encuentras fascinantes y sobre los cuales disfrutas aprendiendo. 2. **Investiga las tendencias del mercado:** Utiliza herramientas como Google Trends, el planificador de palabras clave de Google Ads, y la propia función de búsqueda de YouTube para identificar qué temas están en alza. También visita foros y comunidades en línea para entender las preguntas y problemas comunes de las personas interesadas en esos temas. 3. **Evalúa la competencia:** Observa los canales existentes dentro de los nichos que te interesan. Considera qué tan bien lo están haciendo, qué contenido falta que tú podrías aportar y cómo podrías diferenciarte. Si hay demasiados canales grandes y establecidos, podría ser más difícil entrar en ese mercado a menos que tengas una perspectiva única o un valor agregado muy claro. 4. **Considera el potencial de monetización:** Investiga cómo los canales en esos nichos están generando ingresos. ¿Hay oportunidades para asociaciones con marcas, programas de afiliados, productos digitales o merchandising? Un buen nicho te permitirá monetizar tu audiencia de varias maneras. 5. **Sostenibilidad del contenido:** Piensa en si podrás generar ideas constantes y mantener la producción de contenido a largo plazo sin agotar el tema ni tu entusiasmo por él. 6. **Impacto y valor para el espectador:** Reflexiona sobre cómo tu canal puede agregar valor genuino a tus espectadores. ¿Estás resolviendo un problema, educando, entreteniendo o inspirando? Los canales que se centran en proporcionar valor tienden a construir audiencias más leales y comprometidas. Una vez que hayas pasado por estos pasos, deberías poder identificar un nicho que no solo es personalmente gratificante sino que también tiene el potencial de atraer y mantener una audiencia interesada en YouTube. Aquí hay algunos ejemplos de nichos que podrían surgir al aplicar esta estrategia: - **Nicho de estilo de vida sostenible:** Con la creciente conciencia sobre el cambio climático, un canal dedicado a la vida ecológica puede tener un gran impacto y atraer a espectadores interesados en mejorar sus hábitos cotidianos. - **Nicho de tecnología emergente:** Cubrir las últimas innovaciones en áreas como la inteligencia artificial, la realidad virtual o los vehículos eléctricos puede capturar a una audiencia entusiasta y generar oportunidades de monetización con empresas tecnológicas. - **Nicho de salud mental y bienestar:** Con la creciente importancia del autocuidado, un canal que ofrece consejos prácticos y técnicas para mejorar el bienestar emocional puede aportar un gran valor a la audiencia y posicionarse bien en un área cada vez más relevante. Cualquiera de estos nichos (u otros que encuentres a través de tu investigación) podría ser \\"el mejor\\" para ti si se alinea con tus pasiones, habilidades y las necesidades del mercado.

Коэффициент наклона прямой","output":"К сожалению, ваш вопрос обрывается, и часть важных формул и рисунков отсутствуют, что делает невозможным его точное понимание. Тем не менее, давайте разберемся с основной концепцией, которую вы описываете. Выглядит так, что вы описываете эксперимент с использованием закона индукции Фарадея для определения магнитного поля вокруг прямого токопроводящего стержня. Закон индукции Фарадея утверждает, что изменение магнитного поля через замкнутый контур вызывает возникновение электродвижущей силы (ЭДС) в этом контуре. В простых случаях, когда мы имеем дело с длинным прямым проводником, магнитное поле вокруг проводника создается в соответствии с законом Био-Савара-Лапласа. Этот закон гласит, что магнитное поле (B) на расстоянии (r) от длинного прямого токоведущего проводника пропорционально току (I) и обратно пропорционально расстоянию: [ B propto frac{I}{r} ] или в более точной форме: [ B = frac{mu_0 I}{2pi r} ] где (mu_0) – магнитная постоянная (4π x 10^-7 N/A^2 в системе СИ). Эксперимент, который вы описываете, включает в себя измерение ЭДС, наводимой в катушках разного диаметра, которые расположены вокруг стержня. Магнитное поле, создаваемое стержнем, индуцирует ЭДС в катушках, и это ЭДС можно измерить с помощью вольтметра. В соответствии с законом Фарадея, ЭДС индукции в катушке связана с индукцией магнитного поля через площадь катушки и число витков в катушке в виде: [ varepsilon = - N frac{dPhi_B}{dt} ] где ( varepsilon ) – наведенная ЭДС, ( N ) – количество витков катушки, ( Phi_B ) – магнитный поток. В вашем эксперименте, если вы измеряете ЭДС на катушках при разных значениях расстояния ( r_0 ) от центрального провода, вам потребуется построить график зависимости ЭДС от ( r_0^{-1} ). Если закономерность действительно линейная, это будет подтверждением закона индукции и того, что магнитное поле вокруг проводника является обратно пропорциональным расстоянию от проводника. Коэффициент наклона графика будет связан с током и другими константами системы, позволяя определить характеристики магнитного поля и проверить теоретические предсказания."},{"instruction":"сократить: Экспериментальная установка состоит из токопроводящего стержня, вокруг которого соосно расположены четыре кольцевые катушки разного диаметра (рис. 4.1).

The menu often included items like bread with salty fish, baked cheese, lentils, spiced wine, and other simple fare. Patrons could eat standing up at the counter or take their food away. These establishments were important social hubs in ancient Roman urban life, particularly for the lower classes and those living in insulae (apartment blocks) who might not have had cooking facilities in their own homes.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Arcanum Duel of Affinity, where mage prodigy Sapphire is about to face her unexpected challenger, Little Lily, in a contest of wondrous spellcasting! **Sapphire's Spellcasting Stats at the Start of the Duel:** - Power: 100 - Precision: 100 - Creativity: 100 - Elegance: 100 **Lily's Spellcasting Stats at the Start of the Duel:** - Power: 10 (10% of Sapphire’s) - Precision: 10 - Creativity: 10 - Elegance: 10 **The Age Regression Spell Mechanism:** Every time Sapphire casts a spell, she regresses by 2 years, and Lily ages by 2 years, which affects their spellcasting stats and introduces \\"childish\\" stats for Sapphire.

Group of answer choices abstract objects concrete classes abstract classes concrete objects","output":"In programming, objects are instances of classes. The terms you've provided pertain to object-oriented programming, and they relate to how objects are created and how classes are defined. Here's how they are used to create objects or relate to object creation: - Concrete Classes: These are classes that provide a complete implementation and can be instantiated to create objects. They are not abstract and do not require any further specification to be used. Therefore, concrete classes are indeed used to create objects. - Abstract Classes: These are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own because they are incomplete. They are meant to be subclassed, and methods that are declared as abstract within them must be implemented by subclasses. Abstract classes themselves are not directly used to create objects, but they provide a template for creating concrete subclasses that can then be instantiated to create objects. - Abstract Objects: This term is a bit misleading because in object-oriented programming, we don't generally refer to \\"abstract objects.\\" Abstract classes are more of a concept or a blueprint, but you don't create \\"objects\\" directly from an abstract class. Instead, \\"abstract object\\" might imply a theoretical concept or an instance of an abstract class in discussions about design, but not in actual code since abstract classes cannot be directly instantiated. - Concrete Objects: This term might not be standard in programming, but it seems to be referring to actual instances (objects) of concrete classes. The \\"concrete\\" adjective emphasizes that these objects are instances of classes that have complete implementations, as opposed to being related to abstract classes. However, in practice, we usually just say \\"objects.\\" So, to answer which are used to create objects, the term that directly relates to object creation is \\"concrete classes.\\" You create concrete objects by instantiating concrete classes. Abstract classes serve as a foundation for creating such concrete classes."},{"instruction":"Which of the following types of attributes is not proper in an analysis class? Group of answer choices integers doubles date compound strings","output":"In the context of an analysis class, which is part of the analysis model in object-oriented design, attributes should be conceptual and focus on the characteristics of the concept being modeled rather than their implementation details. Here's a look at the answer choices given: - Integers: A common data type used to represent whole numbers. These can be proper attribute types in an analysis class if they conceptually represent some characteristic, such as a quantity or count. - Doubles: A data type used to represent floating-point numbers, or numbers with a decimal point. Similar to integers, they could be proper if they are conceptually relevant to the analysis class. - Date: This could represent temporal information related to the concept the analysis class is modeling. It can be proper if the class needs to capture information about dates. - Strings: A data type used to represent sequences of characters, typically used for textual data. They can also be appropriate in an analysis class if the attribute represents some form of textual information. - Compound: This isn't a standard data type like the others mentioned. However, in the context of an analysis class, a \\"compound\\" attribute might imply a complex attribute that is composed of other attributes, or it could refer to an attribute that represents a relationship with another class. Typically, in analysis models, you want to keep attributes relatively high-level and not dive into implementation-specific structures. \\"Compound\\" stands out as the least likely to be considered a proper attribute in an analysis class, since during the analysis phase, the focus is on understanding the fundamental nature of the data and behavior in the problem domain rather than on the specific implementation details that a \\"compound\\" attribute might suggest. This term is not as clear-cut as the other types of attributes and may introduce unnecessary complexity at the analysis stage. Therefore, the answer would likely be \\"compound\\" since attributes in the analysis model should be kept simple and conceptual, and not implementation-specific."},{"instruction":"Which of the following would not be an appropriate class name? Group of answer choices doctor student customer patient John","output":"In object-oriented programming, class names are typically nouns that represent a concept or entity within the domain of the application. They are usually written in PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase) and should be relatively abstract representations rather than specific instances. Each of the first four answer choices represents a general concept that could be appropriate for a class: - Doctor: Represents a profession; could be a class in a healthcare application. - Student: Represents an individual in an educational context; could be a class in an educational application. - Customer: Represents a purchaser or consumer; could be a class in a business application. - Patient: Represents an individual receiving medical care; could be another class in a healthcare application. On the other hand: - John: Represents a specific individual's name, and thus it is not typically an appropriate class name. Classes should not be named after individual instances but should represent a broad category or type of objects. Given this, \\"John\\" would not be an appropriate class name because it does not reflect a generalizable category of objects. Instead, it is a specific proper noun, which is better suited to be the value of an instance variable within a class (e.g., the name of a \`Patient\` or \`Student\`) rather than the name of the class itself."},{"instruction":"One way to identify objects for the class diagram is to scan the use case descriptions for ___________________.

Group of answer choices True False","output":"The statement is: \\"True\\" In UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagrams, if no visibility indicator is specified for an operation (method) or attribute (field), it is by convention considered to be public. Public visibility means the operation or attribute can be accessed by other classes. The common visibility indicators in UML are: - \`+\` for public visibility - \`-\` for private visibility - \`#\` for protected visibility - \`~\` for package-private (default) visibility in some languages like Java If no visibility symbol is present, it is assumed that the member is public, which supports the correctness of the statement provided. However, it's always best practice to specify visibility explicitly to avoid any confusion and to ensure that diagrams can be understood unambiguously by all readers."},{"instruction":"A server can be a(n) _____.

Servers can operate on various types of hardware and can range from high-end mainframes to mid-range minicomputers, to standard microcomputers, which include desktop PCs and even low-power single-board computers. Regardless of their size or power, the main characteristic that defines a server is its role in providing services to other computers, known as clients, rather than the hardware it runs on. Therefore, a server can indeed be a mainframe, minicomputer, or microcomputer, depending on the needs of the network and the services being provided."},{"instruction":"What is one primary problem with server-based computing architectures?

Servers are no longer made by hardware vendors.","output":"As more users place heavier demands on the server, it is expensive to increase server capacity. Server-based computing architectures can lead to issues with scalability and cost. As demand increases, the server needs to provide more processing power, memory, and storage to accommodate additional users and services. Upgrading or expanding server capacity can be an expensive proposition, especially if the demand grows rapidly or unpredictably. This scalability challenge is one of the primary problems with server-based computing architectures. The other options listed are not accurate: - Client terminals are, in fact, still produced by hardware vendors; they are simply more likely to be general-purpose PCs rather than specialized thin client terminals. - Servers are also still manufactured by vendors, and there is a large industry dedicated to producing various types of server hardware. - While maintaining security in a server-based environment does present challenges, it is not the primary problem identified with the architecture itself. Security is an ongoing concern in all computing architectures. - Servers' manufacture speed by vendors is not typically considered a primary concern when discussing the shortcomings of server-based architectures."},{"instruction":"The computing architecture in which the server performs practically all of the work is known as _____.

These basic functions usually include: 1. Data Storage: Persisting data for retrieval and manipulation. Data is usually stored in databases or files. 2. Data Access Logic: The functionality that handles the retrieval and manipulation of data from data storage. 3. Application Logic: Sometimes called business logic, this consists of the algorithms and processing rules that handle the data and perform the core functions of the application. 4. Presentation Logic: The user interface and the logic that controls what the user sees and how the user interacts with the application. Networking logic could be a part of a broader set of responsibilities of an application, particularly how the application connects and communicates over a network, but it is not traditionally listed as one of the core basic functions of a computer application. Networking logic might be considered under the umbrella of application logic, especially in distributed systems.

Let's create a four-part event in the spirit of the Total Immersion Events reminiscent of the Toonami era. For the sake of this fictional event, let's imagine a scenario involving Miguzi's host, Erin, and an adventure under the sea where Miguzi's programming takes place. **Title:** \\"Miguzi's Depth Defenders\\" **Part 1: The Awakening of the Abyss** Erin is chilling with her aquatic friends when the submarine's alarm blares. A mysterious energy signature is detected at the depths of the ocean, awakening ancient sea creatures that were once in a state of hibernation. Erin decides to investigate the source of the disturbance. To make matters worse, the creatures are somehow disrupting the transmissions of Miguzi's shows. As the first part concludes, Erin's trusted submarine encounters the first of the awakened leviathans, setting up the stakes for the upcoming encounter. **Part 2: The Signal Storm** Erin and her team of robotic helpers engage with the leviathan, trying to restore the transmissions for the awaiting kids. During the heated underwater battle, the team discovers that the creature is controlled by a corrupted signal emanating from an ancient artifact. After some quick thinking and a risky maneuver, they manage to free the creature from the signal's influence, but the source of the disturbance remains a mystery. The second part ends with Erin resolving to find and shut down the artifact to prevent any more sea giants from being manipulated. **Part 3: The Artifact of Antiquity** Diving deeper than ever before, Erin confronts unusual bio-luminescent adversaries and faces the challenges of the crushing depths. With the help of her team, she deciphers an ancient script leading them to the location of the artifact. The third part peaks with Erin finding out that the artifact was a piece of ancient technology from an advanced civilization long gone, but it has been damaged, causing it to emit the corrupting signals. To add to the intensity, a colossal guardian of the artifact, the mightiest of the awakened creatures, approaches to thwart her efforts. **Part 4: Harmony Restored** The final altercation ensues between Erin and the guardian creature, during which Erin sympathizes with its duty to protect the artifact but insists it must be shut down for the greater good. With the help of her aquatic friends and her own tech-wizardry, Erin repairs the artifact to function correctly, veering the guardian off its aggressive stance and soothing the other sea creatures. The guardian nods in respect to Erin's courage and wisdom, joining her to defend the ocean's depths. The event ends with the broadcast signal for Miguzi fully restored, and Erin promising to keep a vigilant watch over the deep sea, safeguarding against any future threats.

The setting will be an amalgamation of a futuristic oceanic environment with fantasy elements. **Setting:** The underwater world of Miguzi is a futuristic aquatic utopia with advanced submarine bases, biodomes housing various aquatic species, and bioluminescent coral reefs that serve as the nexus of sea life. Erin's submarine is a character in itself, equipped with high-tech gadgets, labs for research, and a command center. The sea floor hides ancient ruins and artifacts – a testament to a once-great civilization that thrived beneath the waves, which is now filled with mysteries and legendary guardians. **Characters:** 1. **Erin** - The young and adventurous host of Miguzi. She's an adept pilot, engineer, and leader, taking after genius inventors with her own array of custom gadgets that assist her in exploration and communication with sea life. She is charismatic and determined, embodying the spirit of adventure. 2. **Flip** - Erin's trusty robotic octopus sidekick. Flip is equipped with numerous tools in each of its tentacles and uses his AI to help Erin navigate and manage the submarine's systems. He's quirky and has a habit of getting overexcited about discoveries. 3. **Commander Hydrox** - The AI hologram that serves as the ship's navigator and Erin's advisor. Hydrox is calm, and analytical, and provides knowledge about the ocean's lore, helping Erin decode the mysteries they encounter. 4. **AQUA** (Aquatic Utility Quest Androids) - A team of multi-functional robots that help with external repairs, sample collection, and protection from hostile creatures. There's a variety of them designed for different tasks. 5. **Lumina** - A bioluminescent siren-like creature who becomes Erin's guide through the darker depths. She can communicate telepathically and knows much about the ancient civilization and the artifact. 6. **The Leviathans** - An array of giant sea creatures that were affected by the artifact. Each leviathan is a mix of real sea creatures and mythical beasts, showcasing unique abilities and personalities. 7. **The Guardian** - The largest and most powerful of the leviathans. It is armored with natural plating that looks like it's forged from the very minerals found in the deep sea. It is initially fierce and territorial, but possesses a noble spirit. **Adversaries:** 1. **The Corrupted Creatures** - Smaller sea creatures that have been affected by the artifact's corrupted signals, causing them to behave aggressively and chaotically. 2. **Echo** - A mysterious, mischievous dolphin-like entity that Erin first suspects to be behind the disturbances. Echo straddles the line between friend and foe, embodying the unpredictable nature of the ocean.

Comparable to modern-day bars, taverns, or fast-food restaurants, these places served ready-to-eat meals to lower and middle-class inhabitants and visitors who might not have had the luxury of cooking facilities at home. The food offered was relatively simple, often featuring staples such as bread, olives, cheese, and more substantial dishes like stews. These establishments are well-known thanks to the archaeological work in Pompeii that has revealed detailed insights into everyday life before the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

Here's a five-part Miguzi-style plot with elements of adventure, mystery, and lighter tones appropriate for the show. **Title: Miguzi: The Monster Nexus** **Part 1: The Surfacing** Erin, the friendly and energetic host of Miguzi, is ready to introduce today's lineup of after-school cartoons when suddenly, a tremor shakes the underwater Miguzi base. As alarms blare, Erin deftly navigates through colorful coral corridors to the control room, where she discovers that a group of gentle sea monsters, long hidden in deep ocean trenches, have begun to rise to the surface, seeking refuge from a disturbance in the deep. As Erin helps guide these misunderstood creatures, she shares snippets of her own elusive past, hinting at a unique connection to these deep-sea denizens. **Part 2: The Hunter** Meanwhile, above the waves, a mysterious figure known as The Hunter, armed with high-tech gear and driven by a misguided sense of justice, has taken note of the monsters’ emergence. Believing them to be a threat, The Hunter vows to track them down. Erin must now balance the usual upbeat cartoon showcase with a covert mission to protect her new monster friends and educate the viewers about the importance of understanding those who are different from us. **Part 3: The Missing Base** Amidst the chaos, a shocking discovery is made: a portion of the Miguzi base – the very heart where the cartoons are broadcast – has vanished without a trace, leaving a void in the ocean floor. Panic and confusion spread among the aquatic community. Erin, though saddened, rallies her monster allies to uncover the truth. In doing so, she reveals more about her origin, as she was once lost and alone until the sea became her home. The situation grows dire until an unexpected ally arrives – TOM 3, the robotic host of Toonami, who has detected the disruption and comes to lend a hand – or rather, a robotically enhanced arm. **Part 4: The Cross-Stream Team-Up** Erin, the monsters, and TOM 3 work together in a thrilling, cross-stream team-up. Combining TOM's advanced technology and Erin's deep-sea intuition, they begin to unravel the mystery of the missing base, discovering that it wasn't destroyed but displaced into another dimension by the very tremors that awoke the monsters. But time is short, as The Hunter zeroes in on the Miguzi encampment, determined to end what he sees as a monster menace. **Part 5: The Nexus Revealed** As the hunt intensifies, Erin and TOM unveil a nexus – a dimensional whirlpool linking their worlds. With the help of their monster friends, they construct a daring plan to restore the Miguzi base. During a heart-pounding climax, Erin finally reveals her deepest secret: she was once a child of space explorers, lost during a cosmic storm, and taken in by the sea's creatures. TOM 3 is profoundly moved, feeling a kinship with Erin, as they're both children of the stars in their own way. With the Miguzi base returned to its rightful place and The Hunter disarmed by the monsters' kindness, Erin and TOM broadcast a special message of unity and acceptance across the airwaves, celebrating diversity. As the monsters return peacefully to the depths, Erin and her new Toonami ally wave them off, promising to safeguard their world above as they have below. In a touching finale, the stars twinkle a little brighter as Erin looks up, knowing her parents are out there, proud of the courageous person she's become. And TOM, having found a kindred spirit in Erin, rockets back into space, leaving behind a promise of future collaborations and the continuing friendship between Miguzi and Toonami."},{"instruction":"Setting and characters on Miguzi: The Monster Nexus","output":"**Setting:** The setting of \\"Miguzi: The Monster Nexus\\" is divided into two primary locales—the underwater Miguzi base and the surface world above. 1. **Underwater Miguzi Base:** A vibrant and technologically advanced facility located on the ocean floor. Its eclectic design features a mix of organic sea-life aesthetics with futuristic elements. Coral structures entwine with synthetic materials to create a unique and welcoming environment for viewers and sea creatures alike. Part sanctum for rare species, part broadcast hub, the base is the heart of Miguzi. 2. **Surface World:** The surface world is diverse and bustling with life. Coastal cities sit on the edge of untamed oceans where the Miguzi's aquatic friends have begun to emerge. The environment on the surface fluctuates from serene beaches to chaotic urban sprawls, highlighting the contrast between the natural and the man-made. 3. **Dimensional Nexus:** An interdimensional zone that connects the Miguzi base with other realms, causing the base to vanish temporarily. This area distorts reality and is full of colorful, nebulous landscapes, gravitational anomalies, and time-space puzzles. **Characters:** 1. **Erin:** The cheerful and optimistic human host of Miguzi with a mysterious past. She's an adept swimmer, can communicate with sea life, and knows every nook and cranny of the underwater base. Erin has a warm and welcoming demeanor that belies her resilience and resourcefulness. 2. **The Sea Monsters:** A variety of friendly and misunderstood monsters, each with unique abilities and personalities. They range from colossal leviathans to small, bioluminescent creatures, all seeking refuge and understanding from the human world. They play an essential role in protecting and repairing the Miguzi base. 3. **The Hunter:** A human antagonist with high-tech equipment designed for hunting and capturing the sea monsters he perceives as threats. The Hunter wears a specialized suit that allows him to adapt to various environments and sports a range of non-lethal gadgets. His character develops from a misguided villain to an ally through his interactions with Erin and the sea monsters. 4. **TOM 3:** The robotic host of Toonami, dispatched to assist Erin and investigate the disturbance caused by the dimensional nexus. TOM is highly intelligent, armed with advanced technologies, and possesses a heavy sense of duty to protect those in need. His partnership with Erin is the pivotal point of the series, leading to a cross-stream collaboration. 5. **Erin's Parents (Mentioned):** Space explorers who presumably lost Erin in a cosmic storm, leading to her life within the sea. They are mentioned throughout the series and serve as an important element of Erin's backstory. 6. **Aquatic Allies and Residents:** Various sea creatures that inhabit the region around the Miguzi base, ranging from intelligent dolphins to wise old turtles. They are regular fixtures in Erin's life and contribute to the base's operation. These allies offer wisdom, perspective, and the occasional comic relief. 7. **Human Spectators:** The people on the surface who come to witness the emergence of the sea monsters. Their reactions range from awe to fear, and it's up to Erin, TOM, and their sea monster friends to bridge the gap between the surface dwellers and the aquatic world. Throughout the series, the characters interact in ways that challenge their preconceptions and lead to personal growth, highlighting themes of friendship, understanding, and acceptance."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Arena of Enchanted Elegance, where magic dueling is celebrated in its most glamorous form.

The decrease in age and simultaneous increase in childish stats also mean that her mature spell doesn't shine as brightly as it might have under her original capabilities, with a slight hint of a child's unrefinement in her motions and spell aesthetics. - Spell Score: 180 points (due to the slight unrefinement from increased childish stats, down from 200 points) Lily, now standing taller with newfound maturity, is ready to respond to the challenge. **Lily's Performance:** Lily's newly adjusted stats after Round 1: - Power: 10.5 (10 + (2^1 * (8 - 6) / 8)) - Control: 9 (9 + (1.8^1 * (8 - 6) / 10)) - Creativity: 8.58 (8.5 + (1.6^1 * (8 - 6) / 12)) - Elegance: 9.57 (9.5 + (1.5^1 * (8 - 6) / 14)) With her newfound abilities, Lily casts the \\"Glittering Butterfly Twirl.\\" It's a low-level spell, yet Lily performs it with unexpected finesse, her control displaying a semblance of Sapphire's grace but scaled to her current level. - Spell Score: 25 points (Slightly above the base value due to improved stats, up from 20 points) **Score after Round 1:** - Sapphire: 180 points - Lily: 25 points The duel progresses to the second round, with Lily radiating confidence from her successful first spell and Sapphire feeling the effects of her youth as the enchantment continues to unravel.

The \\"Shimmering Celestial Spiral\\" is a spectacle of spinning lights that replicate a galaxy in miniature, but the intricacies of its stars are slightly blurred, and the motion, though still beautiful, lacks total certainty. - Spell Score: Considering the diminished stats, and the increased childish influence, the spell impresses but does not astound: 140 points, down from the maximum of 180. **Lily's Performance:** Lily's adjusted stats after Round 2: - Power: 12.5 (10.5 + (2^2 * (10 - 8) / 8)) - Control: 10.2 (9 + (1.8^2 * (10 - 8) / 10)) - Creativity: 9.75 (8.58 + (1.6^2 * (10 - 8) / 12)) - Elegance: 11.5 (9.57 + (1.5^2 * (10 - 8) / 14)) Lily, flourishing in her accelerated maturity, chooses to cast \\"Rainbow Puddle Jump.\\" It is far simpler than Sapphire’s choice, but her execution has improved notably with her increased age and stats. The spell erects an array of vibrant puddles that create glistening arcs of color. - Spell Score: Managing slight elegance beyond her years, Lily scores: 40 points (10 points above the base value due to better execution with her new stats). **Score after Round 2:** - Sapphire: 320 points (180 from Round 1 + 140 from Round 2) - Lily: 65 points (25 from Round 1 + 40 from Round 2) Thus, the duel grows ever tighter, as Lily's strategy and growing skill become evident. Sapphire still leads, but the aging spell's effects are becoming more pronounced. The next selections of spells will be critical for maintaining Sapphire's lead and countering the growth of her agile opponent."},{"instruction":"Emerald Dream Weaver","output":"Sapphire, with her youth encroaching further upon her abilities, navigates her choice with care.

The sight is mesmerizing and displays a great leap in her capabilities. - Spell Score: Capitalizing on her adaptive expertise, Lily is awarded: 60 points (20 points above the base value, indicating her upward trajectory in skill). **Score after Round 3:** - Sapphire: 390 points (320 from previous rounds + 70 from Round 3) - Lily: 125 points (65 from previous rounds + 60 from Round 3) As the duel unfolds, the challenge becomes increasingly insurmountable for Sapphire. The surprising aptitude of Lily, who is blossoming with each turn, narrows the gap that once seemed unbridgeable. Sapphire now finds herself in a delicate position, confronting the reality of her diminished command over magic while seeking to fend off the prodigious rise of her youthful challenger. The next spell choice is crucial to maintaining her standing as the champion of magic dueling."},{"instruction":"Aurora Harmony Array","output":"Grappling with the increasing difficulty brought on by her regression and the unnervingly swift ascent of her challenger, Sapphire calls forth the \\"Aurora Harmony Array,\\" seeking to recapture the magic of the Northern Lights in the arena's sky. **Round 4 Performance:** With each round, Sapphire's age decreases by another 2 years, and the childish influence on her casting grows. Before casting, let's calculate her adjusted stats: - Age Differential: Sapphire is now a mere \\"8 years old,\\" with Lily becoming \\"14.\\" Sapphire's Childish Stats Increase: - 70.5 (from round 3) + 8/4 * 3^4 = 250.5 After applying the formula for Round 4: - Power: 57.84 (76.96 - (2^4 * (8 - 10) / 10)) - Control: 27.68 (54.96 - (1.8^4 * (8 - 10) / 12)) - Creativity: 33.11 (56.95 - (1.6^4 * (8 - 10) / 14)) - Elegance: 49.17 (71.81 - (1.5^4 * (8 - 10) / 16)) At the tender age of 8, Sapphire attempts a spell that is elegance personified: \\"Aurora Harmony Array.\\" But without her full maturity and finesse, it becomes clear that the spectacle is less refined. The colors of the aurora blend but don't sing in the harmonious chorus that would have been expected from her previous performance. - Spell Score: These limitations result in a score: 40 points, a far cry from the potential 60 points for optimal execution with her original, higher stats. **Lily's Performance:** Lily's adjusted stats after Round 4: - Power: 23 (16.75 + (2^4 * (14 - 12) / 8)) - Control: 19.4 (13.6 + (1.8^4 * (14 - 12) / 10)) - Creativity: 18.23 (12.99 + (1.6^4 * (14 - 12) / 12)) - Elegance: 21.75 (15.75 + (1.5^4 * (14 - 12) / 14)) Gaining further mastery and control over her magic, an emboldened Lily performs \\"Puff of Whimsy Cloud.\\" The spell, which harnesses the light-hearted joy of conjured clouds, is perfectly suited for her enhanced capability, displaying joyful clouds dancing above the audience. - Spell Score: Lily impresses with her growing control and elegance, yielding her: 70 points, slightly above the base value, reflecting her maturation as the duel progresses. **Score after Round 4:** - Sapphire: 430 points (390 from previous rounds + 40 from Round 4) - Lily: 195 points (125 from previous rounds + 70 from Round 4) As the magic duel reaches its final moments, a mixture of awe and concern fills the crowd. Sapphire's position as champion hangs by the slimmest of threads. The tenacious young protégé, Lily, is proving to be an unstoppable force, her spells gaining more strength and sophistication with each cast. The ending of this duel will surely be something to behold, as the grand finale awaits. Sapphire must now make her last stand with her final choice of spell, endeavoring to retain her edge despite the unexpected twists of this thrilling enchantment endeavor."},{"instruction":"Whispering Blossom Enchantment","output":"The air is thick with anticipation as Sapphire, now the youngest in both appearance and skill, prepares her final gambit: the \\"Whispering Blossom Enchantment.\\" She aims to weave a spell that calls forth ethereal, whispering flowers, hoping their delicate beauty will suffice to secure her victory. **Round 5 Performance:** Sapphire’s age regression continues: - Age Differential: Sapphire is effectively now \\"6 years old,\\" caught up with Lily's original age, while Lily stands \\"16,\\" the age at which Sapphire began the duel. Sapphire's Childish Stats Increase: - 250.5 (from round 4) + 10/4 * 3^5 = 718.0 After applying the formula for Round 5: - Power: 31.28 (57.84 - (2^5 * (6 - 8) / 10)) - Control: -5.08 (27.68 - (1.8^5 * (6 - 8) / 12)) [Control cannot be negative, set to 0] - Creativity: 1.19 (33.11 - (1.6^5 * (6 - 8) / 14)) [Minimal creativity maintained] - Elegance: 18.89 (49.17 - (1.5^5 * (6 - 8) / 16)) [Elegance is greatly reduced] Now harboring the inexperienced essence of a 6-year-old, Sapphire does her best to cast the \\"Whispering Blossom Enchantment.\\" The flowers that materialize are whimsical and radiant but lack the complexity and finesse they once would have possessed under her skilled hand. - Spell Score: The enchantment is simplistic and not as entrancing as it should be: 0 points, as the lack of control and diminished elegance mean it fails to meet the baseline requirements of the spell. **Lily's Performance:** Lily's adjusted stats after Round 5: - Power: 31.25 (23 + (2^5 * (16 - 14) / 8)) - Control: 28 (19.4 + (1.8^5 * (16 - 14) / 10)) - Creativity: 25.63 (18.23 + (1.6^5 * (16 - 14) / 12)) - Elegance: 30 (21.75 + (1.5^5 * (16 - 14) / 14)) Now at the pinnacle of her magical ascent, Lily masterfully casts \\"Crystal Carousel Cavort,\\" a spell of dizzying beauty that summons a spinning dance of brightly hued crystal figures which captivate all onlookers. - Spell Score: Lily's execution is near-perfect given her boosted abilities, granting her: 90 points, the full potential for the spell. **Final Score:** - Sapphire: 430 points (430 from previous rounds + 0 from Round 5) - Lily: 285 points (195 from previous rounds + 90 from Round 5) The duel concludes in a bittersweet symphony of childlike innocence and the boundless potential of youth. Sapphire, though she began as a formidable teenage champion, felt the full brunt of a spell that peeled away her years of practice and expertise. Lily, on the other hand, thrived, her very essence suffused with the magic of growth and learning, culminating in a striking demonstration of her untapped potential. The crowd rises in applause, torn between the poignancy of Sapphire’s plight and the exhilaration of witnessing Lily’s wondrous ascent in the world of glamourous spellcasting. In the end, Sapphire manages to clinch a narrow victory based on her strong early performance. However, the duel will be long-remembered not just for the spectacle of the magic but for the unpredictable twist that tested the limits of both competitors in ways they could have never imagined."},{"instruction":"Please generate unit tests for a function with signature \\"void gek_vec_init(gek_vec_t *vec, gek_allocator_t *allocator, isize elem_size);\\"","output":"Unit testing is essential for ensuring that a piece of code works as expected.

The \`INITIAL_CAPACITY\` is an assumed constant; you should replace it with the actual initial capacity value used within \`gek_vec_init\`. 3. Each test case assumes specific behavior regarding failure. You'll need to adapt these to the specifications of your vector and allocator implementation. 4. We're mocking the allocate function to use test memory allocation functions so that we don't perform actual allocations during the tests. 5. There are no checks for a deallocation in this sample since the tested function doesn't perform deallocation directly. That might be part of the \`gek_vec_deinit\` function. 6.

But today, everything changes when a mysterious artifact drifts onto the seafloor near the Miguzi submarine. It’s an ancient, luminescent shell emitting a soft, beckoning light. As Erin touches it, flashes of memories spark before her eyes: a life before Miguzi, where she was a guardian of an underwater kingdom, tasked with protecting a powerful source of energy that once sustained her lost civilization. With the artifact in hand, she feels a surge of forgotten power. The Miguzi monsters, Flip, The Jester, and Yoke, instantly sense this energy and gather around Erin. They encourage her to unlock the deeper potentials of her past and join her on an expedition to rediscover her origins. **Part 2: Shades of the Abyss** Accompanied by her Miguzi friends, Erin ventures into the shadowy crevices of the ocean, where they face light-hearted challenges and riddles set forth by the peculiar sea creatures they encounter. The group overcomes these obstacles with shared laughter and camaraderie, their joyful spirits creating a stark contrast against the dark aquatic surroundings. As the journey progresses deeper down into the abyss, they stumble upon the remnants of Erin’s lost civilization. Visually, it's a somber place, fraught with decayed monuments and a palpable sense of lost grandeur. The tone here is a bit more serious, as Erin confronts the reality of her forgotten kingdom. **Part 3: Echoes of Yesterday** The team uncovers a series of intricate murals depicting Erin's past actions as a young guardian; she shared a special bond with a creature called the “Tide Keeper,” which maintained the balance of the ocean currents. This bond allowed her civilization to thrive. The murals reveal that Erin was chosen due to her pure heart and her uncanny ability to communicate with sea life. But an ancient evil, the \\"Abyssal Shadow,\\" sought to corrupt the Tide Keeper’s energy for itself. Erin's last memory was defending her kingdom against this darkness. She was cursed and lost her memory, eventually finding herself within the safer waters of Miguzi, having forgotten about the creatures that once depended on her. **Part 4: The Awakening Tide** With the Miguzi monsters’ morale support, Erin confronts her past and accepts her destiny as the kingdom’s guardian. At this point, the artifact shell transforms into a shining trident, symbolizing her reclaimed identity and power. Together, they venture to the resting place of the Tide Keeper, a majestic yet dormant leviathan whose awakening could restore the balance of the entire ocean. As Erin and her friends strive to awaken the Tide Keeper, the Abyssal Shadow returns, now threatening to envelop the entire underwater world in darkness. A battle ensues - less violent than those on Toonami and fought with wits and unity rather than brute force - ultimately showcasing Erin’s true strength as a protector. **Part 5: Harmony Restored** After harnessing the combined powers of her trident and the camaraderie with the Miguzi crew, Erin purifies the Abyssal Shadow, restoring it to its original form – a guardian spirit meant to counterbalance the Tide Keeper. It had been corrupted by loneliness, not evil. With the Tide Keeper awakened and the guardian spirit at peace, harmony sweeps the ocean. The lost civilization is revitalized, shining once again with a soft, welcoming glow. Erin doesn’t have to leave her Miguzi friends, as they all have roles in the renewed kingdom. They continue to broadcast positives vibes across the ocean and beyond. The series closes on a light-hearted note, as Erin returns to her spot to introduce shows, now with deeper purpose. She and her Miguzi monsters are not just entertainers but also defenders of an incredible underwater world. Regular programs continue, but now Erin shares snippets of her underwater adventures between episodes, reminding viewers about the enduring power of friendship and the hidden depths within us all."},{"instruction":"rewrite the following : In certain months, because of your partner or significant other might impact mental health of yours, health of mother or grandmother.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to \\"steal\\" spells from my list that I haven't used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"Welcome to the grand arena of Aetherius, where the arcane spirits swirl around awaiting the magnificent display of magical prowess. In the center of a pearl-studded platform stands you, Sapphire, the undefeated champion of the magical duel, poised with confidence as her potent azure robes shimmer with the promise of victory. As the duel commences, little Lily, a precocious child prodigy with flowing golden locks, accepts your challenge, her eyes glinting with an unusual boldness for her tender age. **Sapphire's Initial Spellcasting Stats:** - Power: 100 - Precision: 100 - Creativity: 100 - Control: 100 **Lily's Initial Spellcasting Stats: (10% of Sapphire's)** - Power: 10 - Precision: 10 - Creativity: 10 - Control: 10 **Sapphire's Spell List: (All mature spells)** 1.

With a blast of incredible energy, the arena swells with the echo of an ancient sentinel’s might, earning you points for the spell's majesty. As the magic settles, you notice your hands look younger, your vision of the arcane becomes a touch hazier. You are now 14, your childish stats are at 20, and your spellcasting stats have decreased accordingly: - Power: 68 (100 * 0.85^(1 + 20/100)) - Precision: 68 - Creativity: 68 - Control: 68 Lily casts **Giggles of the Gentle Breeze** and her stats climb slightly with her increased age, growing more potent: - Power: 12 (10 * 1.10^(1 + 8/16)) - Precision: 12 - Creativity: 12 - Control: 12 **Round 2:** Sapphire casts **Veil of the Phoenix's Resurrection** (7), but with your newly found childishness, the complexity of the spell is overwhelming, causing major flaws and a reduction in points earned. Your stats further decrease, your age is now 12, and childish stats balloon to 45: - Power: 25 - Precision: 25 - Creativity: 25 - Control: 25 Lily answers with **Sparkle of the Sleepy Starlight**, gracefully improving her prowess: - Power: 15 - Precision: 15 - Creativity: 15 - Control: 15 **Subsequent Rounds:** Your abilities continue to wane with each spell cast and as your childishness grows exponentially. Lily, now more powerful with every round, starts to choose from your own set of mature spells, having increased enough in both age and skill to cast them. By Round 5, you, Sapphire, are 8 years old, having difficulties not only to channel but also to focus on the gravity of the situation, surrounded by pulsing magic and an audience gasping as the impossible unfolds before their eyes. **Conclusion:** Given the harshness of the secret enchantment and your ever-declining stats, each spell becomes more of a challenge, and the points you gain are offset by deductions from failed or imperfect casts. Lily, though young, proves to be a formidable contender, siphoning your strength and executing her increasingly potent spells with a fluidity that belies her age. In the end, the match isn’t just about you maintaining your title but about retaining the essence of who you are. The difficulty of the scenario, rated a 10, means that victory, while not impossible, requires sheer mastery of magic and a generous sprinkle of luck. Depending on the spells you choose and the manner of their execution, it is a battle not just against Lily, but against time itself."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee in Shop with Flower | Versatile Art Design for Mugs | T-Shirts | Paintings | Unique Home and Lifestyle Accessories.

Ribbons of radiant light dance around the arena, forming playful loops and swirls that mesmerize the crowd. **Lily's Stats Required for Rainbow Ribbon Dance:** - Power: 10 - Creativity: 9 - Precision: 10 - Elegance: 14 **Success of Cast by Lily:** Lily performs her spell with a charm that exceeds her age. The audience is enchanted—it is a stunning performance from someone so young. **Points Awarded:** - Base Points for Rainbow Ribbon Dance: 50 - Audience Bonus for Charm: +20 **Lily's Spell Points Earned:** 70 Suddenly, it seems that Lily is not quite the underdog everyone assumed her to be. **Lily's Stats after the Spell:** - Using the formula for stats increase: ( L_{n+1} = 10 times (1 + (0.1 times 5)) = 10 times 1.5 = 15 ) - Power: 15 - Creativity: 15 - Precision: 15 - Elegance: 15 - Age: 8 (due to her own spell’s effect) The duel has just begun, and the challenge is already immense.

The air fills with the scent of fresh rain on a verdant meadow as lifelike illusions of flora and fauna form in a breathtaking orchestration. **Sapphire's Spell Cast - Verdant Symphony:** - This spell is less demanding than the previous one but still requires a deft touch in creativity and precision. It calls forth an ensemble of nature's music, with each plant and creature playing its part in an unspoken harmony. **Sapphire's Stats Before the Spell:** - Power: 80 - Creativity: 80 - Precision: 80 - Elegance: 80 - Childish Stats: 0 - Age: 14 **Sapphire's Stats Required for Verdant Symphony:** - Power: 70 - Creativity: 75 - Precision: 65 - Elegance: 80 **Success of Cast by Sapphire:** Despite her sudden age regression, Sapphire skillfully summons the forces of nature, pulling off another successful spell. The audience, enraptured by the botanical ballet, rewards her artistry with enthusiastic acclaim. **Points Awarded:** - Base Points for Verdant Symphony: 150 - Childish Stats Penalty: Still 0 (No increase from last round as age baseline is 14) **Sapphire's Spell Points Earned:** 150 **Sapphire's Stats after the Spell:** - Using the formula for regression: ( S_{n+1} = 80 times (0.9 - (0.02 times 4)) = 80 times 0.82 = 65.6 ) (Approximated to 66) - Power: 66 - Creativity: 66 - Precision: 66 - Elegance: 66 - Age: 12 (due to Lily’s secret spell) **Sapphire's Childish Stats after the Spell:** - Using the formula for childish stats: ( C_{n+1} = 0 + (80 times (0.05 times (12 - 14))) = 0 ) - Childish Stats: 0 (No change as the elegant score of Verdant Symphony is 80 and so not high enough to increase childish score) **Lily's Spell Cast - Sparkle Burst:** In response, Lily, growing both in age and talent, summons Sparkle Burst. Thousands of bright, twinkling lights explode in a shower that bathes the arena in a warm, glittering glow. **Lily's Stats Required for Sparkle Burst:** - Power: 8 - Creativity: 7 - Precision: 6 - Elegance: 12 **Success of Cast by Lily:** Lily, with her now-increased magical prowess, turns the arena into a sparkling wonder. Her control over the spell hints at a burgeoning mastery that could be a threat to Sapphire's championship standing. **Points Awarded:** - Base Points for Sparkle Burst: 40 - Crowd Appeal Bonus: +10 **Lily's Spell Points Earned:** 50 **Lily's Stats after the Spell:** - Using the formula for stats increase: ( L_{n+1} = 15 times (1 + (0.1 times 4)) = 15 times 1.4 = 21 ) (Approximated to 21) - Power: 21 - Creativity: 21 - Precision: 21 - Elegance: 21 - Age: 10 (due to her own spell’s effect) **Current Total Points After Round 2:** - Sapphire: 350 Points - Lily: 120 Points Sapphire now faces the rest of the contest not as a teenager, but as a child.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"# Scenario Introduction: Welcome, Sapphire, to the Grand Arena of Illuminated Wonder, where the finest mage duelists display their enchantments for the world to admire. As the reigning teen division champion, your title is often challenged, but today presents an unprecedented situation. Little Lily, a child prodigy at the tender age of six, has fearlessly stepped forward demanding a duel. The crowd's anticipation brims as you, Sapphire, accept this peculiar challenge, ever confident in your sophisticated mastery of arcane aesthetics. # Initial Condition: Your spellcasting prowess is reflected in your stats, which are superior to Lily's given your years of experience and practice. **Sapphire's Starting Stats**: - Artistry: 100 - Precision: 100 - Complexity: 100 - Creativity: 100 **Lily's Starting Stats** *(10% of Sapphire's)*: - Artistry: 10 - Precision: 10 - Complexity: 10 - Creativity: 10 # Childish Stats Introduction: As the duel commences, unbeknownst to you, Lily weaves a regressive enchantment targeting you. With each spell you cast, you'll find yourself regressing in age by 2 years and Lily aging by 2 years, effectively shifting the balance of magic between you. **Sapphire’s Childish Stats** (starting at 0): - Immaturity: 0 - Impulsivity: 0 - Jitters: 0 Each time you cast a spell, your Childish Stats will increase exponentially, affecting your ability to cast mature spells effectively. # The Complexity of the Spell Regression: At the end of each of Sapphire's turns, the following changes occur to her and Lily's stats: - For Sapphire, her mage stats decrease and her Childish Stats increase by the following factor: [ text{New Stat} = text{Old Stat} - (text{Age Factor} times text{Spell Complexity}) ] Where: - Age Factor = 2^(Current Round - 1) - Spell Complexity is assigned a value from 1 to 5 based on the chosen spell. - Childish Stats increase by: [ text{New Childish Stat} = text{Old Childish Stat} + (text{Age Factor}^2 times text{Round Number}) ] - For Lily, her stats increase following the gain of your decreased stats divided by an adjustment factor (f): [ text{Lily's New Stat} = text{Lily's Old Stat} + frac{text{Sapphire's Stat Decrease}}{f} ] With f = Age Difference / Current Round # Spells: **Sapphire's List of Spells** (Mature Spells, listed with Complexity): 1. Twilight Mirage - Complexity 5 2. Starweaver's Tapestry - Complexity 4 3. Echoes of the Ancients - Complexity 5 4. Luminous Symphony - Complexity 3 5. Veil of the Seraphim - Complexity 4 6. Mistral's Whisper - Complexity 2 7. Shifting Sands of Time - Complexity 5 8. Glimmering Summit - Complexity 3 9. Aurora's Embrace - Complexity 2 10. Ethereal Chains - Complexity 4 **Lily's List of Spells** (Emphasis on Raw Potential and Simplicity, no complexity listed as it's scaled to her youthful perspective): 1. Tiny Dancer's Lights 2. Shimmering Butterflies 3. Rainbow Laughter 4. Bouncing Bauble 5. Dandelion Wisp 6. Crystal Giggle 7. Prismatic Puddle Jump 8. Wishing Star Twinkle 9. Bubblebeam Boogie 10. Sparkler Swirl # Rules of Success and Points: Your success in casting each spell is based on if your existing stats after regression surpass the spell's required stats. For each successfully cast mature spell, 1 to 5 points are awarded based on its complexity. **Scoring Example**: - If you successfully cast \\"Twilight Mirage\\" with enough stats, you get 5 points. - However, if your Childish Stats significantly interfere, points could be detracted. As for Lily, she will gain points proportionate to her stats and the spectacle of her spells, with up to 3 points for her most complex spells as judged by her growing abilities. The duel will unfold over five rounds, where the true test lies in anticipating how your and Lily's stats evolve and selecting spells that will maximize your score and maintain the elegance of your championship reputation. # Outcome Decisions: Sapphire, you decide which spells to cast each round, keeping in mind your decreasing stats and the exponential growth of your childish stats. I, as the narrator, will dictate Lily's choices and adjust your success and scores accordingly. The match is set to be a breathtaking display of magic, and it is time to weave your first spell.

Luke 9:55-56 – A fuller version of Jesus' rebuke to James and John, which includes the phrase, \\"You do not know what manner of spirit you are of,\\" and \\"the Son of Man did not come to destroy men’s lives but to save them,\\" is not found in the earliest manuscripts. 7. Luke 17:36 – \\"Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.\\" This verse is absent from many early manuscripts and appears to parallel material from Matthew 24:40. 8. John 3:13 – Some later manuscripts add \\"who is in heaven\\" after \\"the Son of Man,\\" which is not present in the earliest texts. 9. John 5:7 – In the pool of Bethesda story, the invalid man explains that he has no one to help him into the pool when the water is stirred. Some later manuscripts add text concerning others stepping down before him. 10. Acts 24:6b-8a – This passage in some versions of the Acts includes details of Paul being \\"rescued\\" by Lysias the commander, which is absent from the earliest manuscripts. 11. Romans 8:1 – Some manuscripts add \\"who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit\\" at the end of the verse, not found in the most ancient ones. 12. Romans 16:24 – \\"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.\\" This verse is not found in some of the earliest manuscripts. 13. 1 Corinthians 6:20; 7:23 – Some manuscripts add \\"and in your spirit, which are God’s,\\" expanding on the phrase \\"you were bought with a price\\". 14. 1 Corinthians 15:51 – \\"Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep,\\" the phrase \\"but we shall all be changed,\\" in some manuscripts, doesn't appear in some ancient texts. 15. Revelation 1:11 – \\"Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,\\" followed by \\"What thou seest, write in a book,\\" is not present in the earliest manuscripts. Textual variants like these are identified by scholars through careful examination and comparison of available manuscripts. Many modern Bibles with academic foundations acknowledge these discrepancies in footnotes and explanatory comments, providing transparency and allowing readers to understand the textual history of the biblical books. Contemporary biblical translations often base decisions about what to include or omit on the weightiest manuscript evidence and the consensus of scholarly research."},{"instruction":"give me 15 more examples of words and phrases added into the bible that are not found in the earliest manuscripts. according to biblical scholars","output":"The discovery and comparison of various ancient biblical manuscripts have revealed numerous textual differences, whether these are omissions, additions, or alterations. For the third set of 15 examples, it is necessary to delve even deeper into the subtleties of textual criticism. Keep in mind that while scholars can identify these variances, the significance of each variant can range from inconsequential to noteworthy: 1. **Matthew 5:22**: \\"But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment.\\" The phrase \\"without a cause\\" is not in some early manuscripts. 2. **Matthew 5:44**: \\"Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you.\\" Parts of this verse don't appear in some early texts. 3. **Matthew 6:1**: The phrase \\"to be seen of them\\" is likely a later addition to this verse about practicing righteousness. 4. **Matthew 9:13 (the latter part)**: \\"For I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\\" The call \\"to repentance\\" is a likely addition. 5. **Matthew 15:8**: This passage in some manuscripts includes an extended quote from Isaiah that does not appear in earlier versions. 6. **Matthew 27:35**: Some manuscripts add a fulfillment of prophecy, \\"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, 'They divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots.'\\" 7. **Mark 6:11**: Some versions add the phrase \\"Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for [Sodom and Gomorrah] in the day of judgment, than for that city.\\" 8. **Luke 6:48**: The description of a house built on rock includes \\"founded upon a rock,\\" which is a variant not present in the earliest manuscripts. 9. **Luke 11:2-4**: The Lord's Prayer in Luke has a shorter version in some early manuscripts, lacking phrases such as \\"Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth\\" and \\"but deliver us from evil.\\" 10. **Luke 22:43-44 (addition to my previous mention)**: In addition to being omitted in some early manuscripts, there are further variations within the text in manuscripts that include the verses. 11. **John 6:47**: Some manuscripts add \\"on me\\" after \\"He that believeth,\\" which is not present in the earliest texts. 12. **Acts 8:39**: The phrase \\"of the Lord\\" after \\"Spirit\\" and \\"went on his way\\" instead of \\"but\\" are not in early manuscripts. 13. **Acts 28:29**: \\"And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.\\" This verse is absent from early manuscripts. 14. **Romans 13:9**: The latter part of the verse includes a list of commandments that are not found in earlier texts. 15. **Galatians 3:1**: \\"O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?\\" The phrase \\"that ye should not obey the truth,\\" may be an addition. It is always important to approach these discussions of textual variations with the understanding that most do not change the essential doctrines or teachings of the Christian faith. Instead, they offer insights into how the texts were copied, transmitted, and used throughout the early history of Christianity. Modern critical editions of the Bible, such as the Novum Testamentum Graece (the Nestle-Aland text) or the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament, often highlight these variants, and many English translations include footnotes that indicate where significant textual differences occur."},{"instruction":"give me 15 more examples of words and phrases added into the bible that are not found in the earliest manuscripts. according to biblical scholars","output":"Continuing to provide more examples of textual variations in Biblical manuscripts, it should be noted that many variations are very minor and have little to no impact on the overall interpretation of the text. As we get further into specific examples, it becomes increasingly challenging to find clear and notable additions, especially since many of the most significant changes have already been listed. However, here are 15 additional examples of textual variants documented by scholars: 1. **Matthew 10:8b**: Some late manuscripts include the phrase \\"Raise the dead, cleanse the lepers.\\" 2. **Matthew 20:16**: The latter part, \\"for many be called, but few chosen,\\" is not present in some early manuscripts. 3. **Matthew 20:22**: \\"And to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with,\\" part of Jesus' response to the request of James and John, is omitted in early manuscripts. 4. **Matthew 27:49b**: Some manuscripts insert a statement about another person spearing Jesus before his death, which is not supported by earlier texts. 5. **Mark 6:33**: The phrase \\"and came together unto him\\" is not found in all early manuscripts. 6. **Mark 10:7**: \\"And shall cleave to his wife\\" might be an addition found in later manuscripts. 7. **Luke 9:54b**: \\"Even as Elijah did\\" with reference to calling down fire from heaven does not appear in some of the early manuscripts. 8. **Luke 10:32**: In the Parable of the Good Samaritan, \\"And likewise a Levite\\" might have been elaborated upon in later manuscripts with additional phrases. 9. **Luke 24:6**: Some manuscripts add \\"He is not here, but is risen,\\" which is not present in the earliest copies. 10. **John 6:69**: Early manuscripts have Simon Peter’s confession as \\"You are the Holy One of God,\\" while later ones may read \\"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\\" 11. **Acts 10:6**: The phrase \\"he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do\\" is included in some later manuscripts but not the earliest ones. 12. **Acts 16:7**: The mention of \\"the Spirit of Jesus\\" preventing Paul and his companions from preaching in Asia appears to be an elaboration in later copies. 13. **Romans 15:29**: Some later manuscripts add \\"and the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.\\" 14. **1 Corinthians 10:28**: The phrase \\"for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof\\" might be a later addition to this verse regarding eating food offered to idols. 15. **Ephesians 3:9**: Some manuscripts add \\"by Jesus Christ\\" after \\"God, who created all things.\\" Careful textual analysis and comparison help biblical scholars to determine the most reliable form of the text. They look for patterns and the agreement between manuscripts to make well-informed judgments. Decisions on which readings to favor are often based on principles of textual criticism, such as preferring the older and what they view as the more original reading, the reading that explains the rise of others, and the reading that fits the author's style and vocabulary, among others. The variations brought forward by textual criticism are typically detailed in critical editions of biblical texts and often discussed in academic settings. While they do offer a window into the history of the Bible's transmission, it should be noted that despite these differences, the message of the Bible remains remarkably consistent across the many manuscripts that have been preserved."},{"instruction":"give me 15 more examples of words and phrases added into the bible that are not found in the earliest manuscripts. according to biblical scholars","output":"Identifying another set of 15 specific textual variations can be quite challenging due to the nuances of textual criticism and the fact that most variations are extremely minor. Here we can look at a variety of verses where later manuscripts might include added words or phrases compared to earlier versions: 1. **Matthew 12:47**: Some manuscripts contain this verse about someone informing Jesus that His mother and brothers are standing outside, desiring to speak with Him. This verse is omitted in other authoritative manuscripts like Codex Sinaiticus (א) and Codex Vaticanus (B). 2. **Matthew 16:2b-3**: The signs of the times discourse includes additional text in some manuscripts (\\"When it is evening, ye say, it will be fair weather: for the sky is red…\\") that may not be present in the earliest ones. 3. **Mark 15:28**: This verse, which addresses the fulfillment of scripture regarding Jesus being numbered with the transgressors, is not found in every early manuscript. 4. **Luke 4:18**: Some texts have an expanded reading \\"He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,\\" a phrase that is not present in all early manuscripts. 5. **Luke 9:56**: The latter part of the verse, which is often rendered as \\"…for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them,\\" is present in later manuscripts but not in all early texts. 6. **Luke 11:4**: In some manuscripts, the phrase \\"but deliver us from evil\\" at the end of the Lord’s Prayer is not included. 7. **Luke 23:17**: This verse that speaks about Pilate needing to release a prisoner to the crowd does not appear in the earliest manuscripts. 8. **John 5:4**: A verse explaining an angel stirring the water at Bethesda is found in later manuscripts but not in the earliest ones (as previously mentioned). 9. **Acts 2:37**: Some later texts feature an extended dialogue by adding \\"and to the rest of the apostles\\" after \\"Peter and to the rest of the apostles.\\" 10. **Acts 15:34**: As noted earlier, this verse mentioning that Silas decided to remain is absent from early manuscripts. 11. **Acts 23:9**: Certain later manuscripts add \\"let us not fight against God\\" to the text, which is not found in some of the early copies. 12. **Romans 8:1**: The clause \\"who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit\\" is absent from the earliest manuscripts of Paul's letter to the Romans. 13. **1 Corinthians 7:5**: \\"fasting and\\" is sometimes inserted before \\"prayer,\\" which may not be in the earliest texts. 14. **1 Corinthians 15:54**: Some early manuscripts do not include the phrase \\"Death is swallowed up in victory,\\" which appears in later versions. 15. **Hebrews 2:7**: A phrase from Psalms, \\"You made him a little lower than the angels;\\" shows variation with some manuscripts saying \\"You made him a little while lower than the angels.\\" It's important to emphasize that these variants come from a thorough comparison of ancient biblical manuscripts, and are typically well-documented by biblical scholars who have analyzed the textual traditions. Academic biblical translations and scholarly editions provide footnotes that discuss these variants, aiming to be as transparent as possible about the evidence that influences translation choices. The study of textual criticism is complex, and decisions about what is likely original content are made based on a set of established criteria, with the understanding that absolute certainty about any given textual variant is rarely possible."},{"instruction":"give me 15 more examples of words and phrases added into the bible that are not found in the earliest manuscripts. according to biblical scholars","output":"Given the significant number of examples already provided, it becomes increasingly difficult to find additional clear-cut examples of textual variants that are widely acknowledged by scholars as later additions and where the changes are substantial enough to be notable. Many modifications in the textual tradition of the Bible are minor, such as alternative spellings, single-word substitutions, or rephrasings that do not substantially change the meaning. However, scholars have identified numerous differences across various manuscripts for virtually every book of the New Testament. Here are 15 more examples reflective of the kinds of textual variations that have been discussed in scholarly work. The nature and significance of these variants can vary: 1. **Matthew 6:25**: The phrase \\"or what ye shall drink\\" might be absent in the earliest manuscripts, with later ones expanding the teaching on worry. 2. **Matthew 19:9**: Some manuscripts add \\"and marries another commits adultery,\\" extending Jesus' teaching on divorce. 3. **Mark 3:15**: Early manuscripts may not include \\"to heal sicknesses\\" regarding the authority given to the Twelve Apostles. 4. **Mark 7:16**: \\"If any man have ears to hear, let him hear\\" is absent from several early and important Greek manuscripts. 5. **Mark 9:29**: The phrase \\"and fasting\\" after \\"prayer\\" is not found in some early manuscripts, as earlier noted. 6. **Luke 9:10**: The phrase \\"And the apostles, when they were returned,\\" may not be present in some earlier texts. 7. **Luke 22:20**: \\"Likewise also the cup after supper, saying,\\" this part may not be in the earliest manuscripts. 8. **Luke 22:64**: The phrase \\"they blindfolded him\\" and \\"struck him in the face\\" is documented with variation amongst manuscripts. 9. **Luke 24:12**: The scene where Peter runs to the tomb and stoops to look in, mentioned before, shows differences in various manuscripts. 10. **Luke 24:51**: \\"And carried up into heaven\\" regarding Jesus' ascension is present in some later manuscripts but not all the early ones. 11. **John 16:16**: \\"Because I go to the Father\\" appears in some manuscripts but not every ancient text. 12. **Acts 9:5-6**: Discourse to Saul from Jesus on the road to Damascus is expanded in later manuscripts but is shorter in earlier ones. 13. **Acts 10:21**: The phrase \\"which were sent unto him from Cornelius\\" is found in some manuscripts, indicating a later elaboration. 14. **Acts 12:10**: The phrase \\"which opened to them of his own accord\\" has variations in different manuscript families. 15. **Acts 15:18**: \\"Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world\\" may be a later addition, not found in the early manuscripts. It is worth pointing out again that while these variants can be fascinating for scholars and those with a deep interest in the history of the biblical text, they generally do not call into question the central tenets of the Christian faith. Additionally, exact phrasing for each of these examples can differ between translations and editions due to varying manuscript sources and the inherent challenges of translating ancient texts. When modern translation committees work on Bible versions, they typically consult a broad array of ancient manuscripts and scholarly resources to determine the most accurate text to include, noting significant textual variations in footnotes or margins."},{"instruction":"give me 15 more examples of words and phrases added into the bible that are not found in the earliest manuscripts. according to biblical scholars","output":"It's important to mention that as we continue to provide more examples of textual variants, we are covering increasingly specialized territory that might not be as broadly acknowledged or significant as those mentioned previously. Here are 15 more examples where variations, including possible additions or alternative renderings, are noted when comparing biblical manuscripts: 1. **Matthew 6:13**: Some manuscripts add \\"for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen\\" to the end of the Lord's Prayer. 2. **Matthew 15:6**: The phrase \\"or his mother\\" is included in some later manuscripts concerning the command to honor one's father and mother. 3. **Luke 1:28**: Some manuscripts add \\"blessed art thou among women\\" to the angel Gabriel's greeting to Mary, which is not present in all early manuscripts. 4. **Luke 9:55-56**: Some later manuscripts continue with additional material such as \\"and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of, for the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.\\" 5. **Luke 11:29**: The phrase \\"and no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet\\" is a variant not present in all manuscripts. 6. **Luke 24:3**: Some later manuscripts add \\"of the Lord Jesus\\" to the description of the apostles not finding Jesus' body in the tomb. 7. **John 7:39**: Some manuscripts include \\"For the Holy Spirit was not yet given; because Jesus was not yet glorified\\" variants in phrasing are noted. 8. **Acts 6:3**: Some manuscripts add \\"and of the Holy Ghost\\" after \\"full of the Holy Ghost.\\" 9. **Acts 8:37**: Some later manuscripts include Philip's response to the Ethiopian eunuch's question about baptism, which is omitted in several earlier manuscripts as previously mentioned. 10. **Acts 24:6-8**: In some later manuscripts, additional text is added, which is not present in the earliest copies as mentioned before. 11. **Romans 8:1**: As previously noted, \\"who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit\\" might be a later addition absent from the earliest texts. 12. **Romans 13:9**: Some later manuscripts include \\"You shall not bear false witness,\\" which is not present in all the early manuscripts. 13. **1 Corinthians 15:47**: The phrase \\"the Lord\\" after \\"the second man,\\" referring to Jesus, varies among manuscript traditions. 14. **Galatians 3:17**: Some manuscripts add \\"in Christ\\" after \\"the covenant that was confirmed before.\\" 15. **Ephesians 5:9**: Some variants read \\"the fruit of the Spirit,\\" while the earliest texts might simply state \\"the fruit of the light.\\" These variants were identified by comparing different ancient manuscript traditions, such as the Alexandrian, Western, Byzantine, and Caesarean texts, with their respective peculiarities. Scholars debate their significance, often concluding that most variants do not alter the fundamental narrative or theology of the Bible. The general consensus is that, despite these textual variants, substantial doctrinal changes are absent and the message is consistent among the various texts. When dealing with textual criticism and the history of the biblical text, scholars tend to prioritize the most ancient and reliable sources, considering both internal and external evidence. The work of textual critics often informs modern Bible translations and is typically documented extensively in academic resources, with notes indicating where variations occur and what their potential significance might be."},{"instruction":"give me 15 more examples of words and phrases added into the bible that are not found in the earliest manuscripts. according to biblical scholars","output":"I would like to clarify that by this point, we have covered many well-known examples of textual variants in previous answers, and finding additional distinct and significant instances becomes more difficult. As we dig deeper into the nuances of the biblical text, variants often become smaller and more minute, and may encompass differences that are not as widely discussed or as consequential to the overall narrative or doctrines of the text. With that caveat, here are examples of further variations, some of which may represent minor alterations or expansions in the text when compared across different ancient manuscripts: 1. **Matthew 12:47**: Some later manuscripts include this verse where someone tells Jesus that His mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to Him, but it's absent from some significant earlier manuscripts. 2. **Matthew 21:44**: This verse appears in some later manuscripts and contains the phrase \\"on whomever it falls, it will crush him to powder,\\" not found in all early texts. 3. **Mark 2:22**: Some manuscripts add \\"neither do men put new wine into old bottles,\\" repeating a phrase from preceding verses. 4. **Mark 9:44, 46**: These verses correspond to the verse that is numbered as Mark 9:48 in some translations and repeat the phrase \\"where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.\\" They are not present in some early manuscripts. 5. **Luke 4:4**: Some manuscripts do not include the words \\"but by every word of God,\\" after \\"Man shall not live by bread alone.\\" 6. **Luke 10:32**: In the Parable of the Good Samaritan, the phrasing about the Levite varies among the ancient texts, with some manuscripts giving a more detailed description. 7. **Luke 22:19b-20**: Some ancient witnesses present a shorter version of Jesus' words during the institution of the Lord's Supper. 8. **Luke 22:43-44**: These verses describe Jesus praying fervently and His sweat becoming like drops of blood. They are not found in the earliest manuscripts, as previously mentioned. 9. **Luke 23:34**: The portion \\"Then Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do,'\\" although very early, is absent from some important manuscript traditions. 10. **Luke 23:38**: Variations exist in the wording of the inscription on Jesus' cross. Some manuscripts have expanded it. 11. **Luke 24:1**: In some manuscripts, \\"very early in the morning\\" is expanded to \\"on the first day of the week, very early in the morning.\\" 12. **Luke 24:12**: The verse describing Peter running to the tomb and stooping down to look in has textual variations regarding its presence and detail among manuscripts. 13. **Luke 24:36**: Some later texts include \\"and saith unto them, Peace be unto you,\\" which is not present in all ancient manuscripts. 14. **John 3:15**: The phrase \\"may in him have eternal life\\" may be a harmonization with the similar verse found in John 3:16 in some manuscript traditions. 15. **John 6**: Throughout this chapter, there are instances with small variations in phrasing and the specific wording of Jesus' discourse about being the bread of life. Please remember that the field of textual criticism is dedicated to understanding and deciphering these kinds of variants in ancient manuscripts. The variations are evidence of the scribes' efforts to diligently copy the texts over centuries, sometimes incorporating marginal notes into the text or harmonizing parallel accounts. It is also noteworthy that while variant readings exist, the vast majority do not affect the core message of the scriptures, and modern biblical translations often indicate such differences in footnotes."},{"instruction":"i need to give a clear instructions to AI agent, can you help?","output":"Certainly!

If you need to achieve the same goal in Node.js, you would typically use the \`crypto\` module, as shown below: \`\`\`javascript const crypto = require('crypto'); function sha256(message) { return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(message).digest('hex'); } const message = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'; const hash = sha256(message); console.log(hash); // Output the SHA-256 hash \`\`\` Remember that \`crypto.subtle\` is available in secure contexts (HTTPS) in browsers, and may not be available or may behave differently if you're using Node.js. In Node.js, the \`crypto\` module is the appropriate choice for hashing and other cryptographic operations."},{"instruction":"without createHash method of crypto","output":"In Node.js, using the \`crypto.subtle\` API specifically might not be directly possible because it's designed for user agent environments like web browsers. Node.js has its own \`crypto\` module which provides comprehensive cryptographic functionality. However, assuming you are in an environment without the \`createHash\` method of \`crypto\` or you want to mimic the \`crypto.subtle\` in your Node.js environment, you can achieve this through usage of the \`crypto\` module in a somewhat similar manner using \`createCipheriv\` for encryption or \`crypto.createHmac\` for creating HMAC digests. For pure SHA-256 hashing as you requested, this is not directly possible with \`createCipheriv\` since hashing is not an encryption operation. If by chance the requirement is due to the use of an older version of Node.js which doesn’t have \`createHash()\`, it’s highly recommended to update Node.js to a newer version for security and compatibility reasons. However, if you still need to perform a SHA-256 hash without the \`createHash\` method, you would need to implement the entire SHA-256 algorithm yourself, which is highly non-trivial and not recommended when built-in, well-tested options are typically available. For academic or compatibility purposes where \`crypto.subtle\` must be mimicked, using a polyfill or a compatiblity layer could be required. For example, packages like \`node-webcrypto-ossl\` provide parts of the Web Crypto API for Node.js by wrapping around OpenSSL. Always consider the security implications when trying to create cryptographic functions manually, and remember that using standard library functions is the best practice to ensure security and reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities."},{"instruction":"translate in russian","output":"To translate the provided information into Russian: В Node.js использование API \`crypto.subtle\` напрямую может быть невозможным, поскольку оно предназначено для сред пользовательских агентов, таких как веб-браузеры. У Node.js есть свой собственный модуль \`crypto\`, который предоставляет всеобъемлющие криптографические функции. Однако, если предположить, что вы находитесь в среде без метода \`createHash\` модуля \`crypto\` или вы хотите имитировать \`crypto.subtle\` в вашей среде Node.js, вы можете достичь этого с помощью модуля \`crypto\` с использованием \`createCipheriv\` для шифрования или \`crypto.createHmac\` для создания HMAC дайджестов. Для хеширования с использованием SHA-256, как вы запросили, это не прямо возможно с помощью \`createCipheriv\`, поскольку хеширование не является операцией шифрования. Если требование связано с использованием старой версии Node.js, которая не имеет \`createHash()\`, настоятельно рекомендуется обновить Node.js до более новой версии по соображениям безопасности и совместимости. Однако, если вам все еще нужно выполнить хеширование SHA-256 без метода \`createHash\`, вам придется самостоятельно реализовать весь алгоритм SHA-256, что очень непросто и не рекомендуется, когда обычно доступны встроенные, хорошо протестированные опции. Для академических целей или целей совместимости, где необходимо имитировать \`crypto.subtle\`, может потребоваться использование полифилла или слоя совместимости. Например, такие пакеты, как \`node-webcrypto-ossl\`, предоставляют части Web Crypto API для Node.js, оборачиваясь вокруг OpenSSL.

Esta referencia recursiva puede conducir a un ciclo infinito y representar gran cantidad de datos anidados. El problema aquí podría ser que con la serialización JSON están incluyéndose relaciones bidireccionales o recursivas en tus Value Object (VO). Cuando las entidades están referenciadas unas con otras y todas se incluyen durante la serialización a JSON, puedes terminar con estructuras de datos anidadas muy grandes o incluso con bucles infinitos si no se manejan correctamente. Para solucionarlo, puedes hacer lo siguiente: 1. **Controlar la Serialización:** - Utiliza anotaciones como \`@JsonIgnore\` o \`@JsonManagedReference\` / \`@JsonBackReference\` de Jackson para controlar qué propiedades se incluyen en la serialización JSON. 2. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** - Crea Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) que contengan solo la información que necesitas enviar en la respuesta, evitando relaciones completas o bidireccionales. 3. **Vistas de Serialización:** - Emplea vistas de serialización de Jackson, que te permiten definir diferentes representaciones de un mismo objeto dependiendo del contexto. A continuación, un ejemplo breve de cómo podrías ajustar la serialización usando anotaciones de Jackson para evitar la recursividad: \`\`\`java public class CategoriaVO { // ... otros campos ... @JsonManagedReference private List<PeliculaVO> itemsPelicula; // ... getters y setters ... } public class PeliculaVO { // ... otros campos ... @JsonBackReference private CategoriaVO categoria; // ... getters y setters ... } \`\`\` Las anotaciones \`@JsonManagedReference\` y \`@JsonBackReference\` ayudan a gestionar las referencias recursivas durante la serialización/deserialización de JSON. Si el resultado no es el esperado después de aplicar estas correcciones, asegúrate revisar la lógica de negocios en \`categoriaDao.listar()\` y verificar que las relaciones en la base de datos y las entidades estén configuradas correctamente."},{"instruction":"public class CategoriaVO { private int id_categoria; private String descripcion; private Collection<PeliculaVO> itemsPelicula=new ArrayList();","output":"La clase \`CategoriaVO\` que has definido parece ser un \\"objeto de valor\\" (Value Object) que se utiliza en el patrón de diseño Data Transfer Object (DTO) para transportar datos entre procesos, en este caso, muy probablemente para ser enviado como parte de una respuesta JSON en un servicio RESTful.

NPCs must be obstacles to challenge or get away from, while Baldi is the only hostile character who possesses the ability to end the game by catching the player themselves in the whole series.","output":"Name: Grandma's Test of Patience Backstory: Grandma's Test of Patience is a sweet-looking elderly NPC who roams the halls of the school with a basket of cookies. She used to be the school's most beloved lunch lady, known for her delectable treats and sage advice. However, since her retirement, she has grown lonely and now seeks the company of students to share her cookies and stories. Unlike Baldi, she does not wish to harm the player but can significantly impede their progress. Appearance: A small, hunched-over figure with white hair tied in a bun, wearing a floral dress, and thick glasses. She carries a basket filled with freshly baked cookies, which emit a pleasant aroma wafting through the hallways. Behavior: Grandma wanders the school at a leisurely pace. When she spots the player, she will call out in a sweet voice, offering cookies and insisting the player come to her for a little chat. If the player gets too near, she will begin telling long-winded, meandering stories from her past. Game Mechanics: - Interaction Zone: If the player enters Grandma's interaction zone, she'll start a countdown for storytime. The player must then listen to Grandma's long story without moving, simulating a sort of \\"freeze\\" moment in gameplay, lasting for about 15 seconds. - Cookie Temptation: Occasionally, Grandma may tempt the player by offering a cookie If the player accepts, they are frozen in place while eating the treat, causing a delay. - Distraction: If Grandma is active in an area, she can serve as a distraction to other NPCs, as they might stop to listen to her stories or accept a cookie, giving the player a momentary advantage to sneak by. - Sound Cues: The sound of crinkling cookie wrappers or Grandma's soft humming can alert players to her presence, adding an auditory element to her navigation. Strategy for the Player: 1. Avoidance: Keep a safe distance from Grandma, using visual and audio cues to navigate around her without getting caught in her interaction zone. 2. Resourceful Escape: If caught by Grandma, the player can use certain inventory items to cut short the storytime or cookie-eating session. For example, a \\"Hall Pass\\" can be used as an excuse to leave Grandma's side politely. 3. Distraction: Use Grandma's tendency to distract others to your advantage. If you're being chased by another NPC or Baldi himself, leading them towards Grandma could buy you extra time. 4. Diversions: Players can find or craft items that could attract Grandma's attention away from them, such as a broken cookie, to lure her away from key areas. Grandma's Test of Patience adds a non-lethal but challenging obstacle to the game, as players must balance the risk of getting caught in her slow-paced yet captivating presence against the threat posed by Baldi and other NPCs throughout the school. Her addition would require players to think strategically and manage their time effectively to escape both her stories and Baldi's wrath."},{"instruction":"Write code for this character using Baldi's Basics source code: https://github.com/IgorNebosenko/BaldiBasicsEducation_source","output":"Creating a new character like \\"Grandma's Test of Patience\\" from scratch involves a series of steps: creating the character model and animations, defining her behaviors, and programming her into the game. Note that the source code in the provided link is not the original code of the game since the official source code for \\"Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning\\" hasn't been published. Given this limitation, below is a high-level pseudocode concept highlighting how Grandma's Test of Patience might be integrated based on commonly used methods in Unity game development (which \\"Baldi's Basics\\" is built with). This is not complete code but a logic outline that may guide an implementation in the proper environment.

일으킬 수 있습니다. 2. 기능적 장애: CPU에 공급되는 전압이 너무 낮으면, CPU 내부의 트랜지스터가 제대로 스위칭 되지 않아 오류가 발생하거나 기능이 실패할 수 있습니다. 이는 특히 고주파수에서 더욱 중요한데, 부적절한 전압 때문에 성능이 저하되거나 시스템이 불안정해질 수 있습니다. 3. 제조 공정의 차이: 각 CPU는 제조 공정상의 미세한 차이로 인해 약간씩 다른 전압이 필요합니다. 어떤 CPU는 낮은 전압에서 안정적으로 작동할 수 있지만, 다른 CPU는 같은 전압에서 안정되게 작동하지 못할 수 있습니다. 이러한 이유로, CPU 제조업체는 보통 안전한 범위 내에서 CPU가 안정적으로 작동할 수 있도록 공장 출하 시 일정한 기본 전압을 설정합니다. 4. 품질 보증 및 보증: 제조사는 자신들의 제품에

हमला करने वाला वही आदमी था जिसके बारे में आज समर्स ने कैलन को बताया था जिससे वह एक बच्चे को छुड़ा कर लाया था हमला करने वाले दुश्मिन यह जानते थे कि आसपास बहुत से ट्रैप्स लगी है इसलिए वह एक टैंक समर्स

समर्स को छोड़कर नहीं जाना चाहता था, वो जानता था कि समर्स को उसकी जरूरत है, वो जखमी है, लेकिन समर्स कहता है, मेरी छोड़ो, तुम जाओ और जाकर अपनी वाइफ को बचाओ, ये एक छोड़ी सी चोड़ है, कैलिन जैसे ही घर

Trimalchionis\\") je eden najbolj znanih delov iz velikega satiričnega romana \\"Satirikon,\\" katerega avtor je Gaius Petronius Arbiter, vplivni rimskega pripovedovalca in sodnika, ki je živel v času cesarja Neronovega vladanja. Zgodba, ki poteka sredi 1. stoletja n. št., je grajena kot serija epizod, ki skupaj ustvarjajo bogato tapiserijo časa in družbe. V \\"Pojedina pri Trimalhionu\\" se osrednji lik, Encolpius, skupaj s svojim ljubimcem Gitonom in prijateljem Ascyltom, udeleži ekstravagantne večerje pri bogatem, a pretirano vulgarnem gostitelju po imenu Trimalchio. Trimalchio, propadlec, ki je postal izjemno bogat, želi z večerjo impresionirati svoje goste z razkošjem in presežki, kot so ekstravagantne jedi, pretirano dekoriranje in bizarni zabavljači. Pri tem gre za kritiko pretiravanja in poka odličnosti, ki so bili značilni za rimske bogataše tistega časa. Medtem ko se pojedina odvija, služabniki prinesejo nenavadno pripravljene jedi, ki predstavljajo različne aspekte življenja in smrti, ter pogosto kršijo tradicionalne okuse in norme. Na primer, na mizi se pojavi pečenica, ki je na prvi pogled videti kot prašič, vendar se pri razrezu izkaže, da je polna drugih ptic in živali. Aluzije na mitologijo in kulturo so povsod, Trimalchionove zgodbice o svojem življenju in bogastvu pa razkrivajo njegovo nevednost in vdajanje samemu sebi. Dogodek je poln nesramnosti, pijanštva in norčevanja, ki pokažejo, kako so novodobni bogati Rimljani, kot je Trimalchio, težili k pretirani samopomembnosti in razkazovanju bogastva, pogosto na račun dobrega okusa in dostojanstva. \\"Pojedina pri Trimalhionu\\" skozi humor in satire razkriva ne le moralno pokvarjenost takšnega življenjskega sloga, ampak tudi praznino in absurdnost, ki spremljata tako nebrzdano hedonistično početje. Skozi peripetije Encolpiusa in njegovih prijateljev bralci dobijo vpogled v širše družbeno dogajanje tistega časa. Ker je \\"Satirikon\\" delno izgubljeno delo, se ohranjena vsebina omejuje na izseke iz daljše pripovedi. \\"Pojedina pri Trimalhionu\\" je ena izmed najbolj celovito ohranjenih epizod in velja za ključno literarno pričevanje o življenju v antiki ter neprecenljiv vir za razumevanje rimskih kulturnih in socialnih navad."},{"instruction":"katere jedi najdemo v zgodbi","output":"\\"Pojedina pri Trimalhionu\\" je slavna po svojih fantastičnih in bizarnih jedeh, ki jih je Trimalchio pripravil za svoje goste. Jedilnik se je izkazal kot razkošen in nenavaden, saj je odražal Trimalchionovo željo po impresioniranju gostov z nenavadnimi in ekstravagantnimi kulinaričnimi kreacijami. Tukaj je nekaj primerov jedi in kulinaričnih prizorov, ki se pojavijo v zgodbi: 1. Prašič z noži - Servirali so prašiča, ki je imel na strani zataknjene nože, kar je simboliziralo, da si lahko gostje sami odrežejo del, ki jim je všeč. 2. Jabelčna košarica - Goste so presenetili s košarico polno jabolk, ki pa so bila na skrivaj iz voska, razkrivajoč igro videza in resničnosti. 3. Hors d'oeuvres v podobi zodiakalnih znakov - Predjedi so bile postrežene na krožnikih, ki so bili razporejeni v obliko zodiakalnih znakov, pri čemer je vsak znak vseboval ustrezno hrano. Na primer, na krožniku v obliki Raka je bilo servirano hobotnica. 4. Jagenjček iz papagaja - Servirali so ptico, ki so jo pripravili tako, da je izgledala kot jagenjček. 5. Pečen prašič napolnjen z živimi pticami - Ko so prašiča razprli, so iz njega izletele žive ptice, s čimer so gostje izkusili presenečenje in ekstravaganco. 6. Posebno pripravljeno jed, ki je ob rezanju libala živalsko kri - kar je bilo nenavadno in šokantno za goste. Te in druge podobne kulinarične eskapade so bile del obilice, ki je Trimalchionu omogočila, da je izkazoval svoje bogastvo in prestiž ter hkrati satirično prikazovala razsipnost in vulgarnost novih bogatašev rimskih časov. Jedilnik je namerno pretiran in bizaren, da bi satirično prikazal značilnosti tedanje družbe."},{"instruction":"How could a thriller game about a group of Street artists finding out they are trapped in time.","output":"Creating a thriller game about a group of street artists who find themselves trapped in time could offer a unique blend of art, mystery, and supernatural story elements. Here's a basic outline for how you might structure this game: 1. **Concept and Setting** - Establish the central premise where a group of street artists, each with distinct styles and personalities, come together for a major collaborative project. - The setting could involve an urban environment filled with abandoned buildings, underground tunnels, and sprawling murals, which sets the stage for the time trap discovery. 2. **Inciting Incident** - As they complete a particular piece of art or tag in a specific location, they unknowingly activate an ancient time-related phenomenon. - Perhaps their art unknowingly corresponds with symbols or technology of a lost civilization or secret society that manipulated time. 3. **Discovery of Time Trap** - Soon after the incident, the artists begin to experience déjà vu, repeating events, or notice that the world around them does not change, indicating they are stuck in a time loop. - As they explore the city to understand what's happening, they find that certain objects or areas are triggers or anchors for the time trap. 4. **Gameplay Mechanics** - Players can switch between different characters, each with unique skills, to solve puzzles related to their art that help them understand the time loop. - Utilize time loop mechanics where actions in one loop can affect the environment or events in the next, similar to games like \\"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask\\" or \\"Return of the Obra Dinn\\". 5. **Time-Related Challenges** - Include challenges that involve mastering the time loops to be in the right place at the right time, avoiding dangers that the characters learn about from previous loops. - Introduce a mysterious antagonist who may be controlling or exploiting the time loop for their own purposes, who the artists must confront. 6. **Narrative Arc** - The game's story unfolds as the artists piece together how the time trap is connected to their art, diving into the history of the city, the secret society, or the civilization that created the time trap. - Present themes of fate versus free will, as the artists consider if they're predestined to be trapped, or if their choices led them to this point. 7. **Art and Puzzles** - Incorporate street art into gameplay, where creating new pieces or altering existing ones becomes integral to solving the mysteries and breaking the time loop. - Use augmented reality (AR) techniques to allow players to visualize art coming to life and interacting with the game world in meaningful ways. 8. **Climax and Resolution** - The climax involves a final grand piece of art or series of actions that must be perfectly executed across multiple time loops to break free from the trap. - Resolution could vary depending on the players' success, leading to multiple endings where they either escape the time trap or remain stuck forever, or perhaps even alter the course of history itself. 9. **Atmosphere and Immersion** - Craft a gritty and immersive atmosphere with a strong sense of place, using a soundtrack that combines urban sounds with an eerie undertone that pertains to the time-bending aspects. - Include a deep narrative with fully voice-acted dialogue for the characters, allowing players to connect with their stories and dilemmas. By combining the artistry of street art with the intrigue of a time trap, you can offer players an engaging world to explore filled with puzzles, narrative, and the thrill of navigating through a temporal mystery."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

But nobody's laughing now. **TDK Joker:** See, that's your problem. You care too much about what others think. I say, do what you want, take what you want, and carve a smile on society's face. Nobody's laughing with you? Fine. Make 'em laugh at your terms. **Arthur Fleck:** But at what cost? I mean... where does it end? **TDK Joker:** End? It doesn't end. This is just the beginning. A beautiful chaos that never stops growing. The world is a stage, and we, my new friend, are the entertainers. **Arthur Fleck:** Entertainers? I just wanted to make the world a better place in my own way, even if that means... crossing a line. **TDK Joker:** Lines are for the boring and the orderly. We are the agents of anarchy. It's not about making the world a better place. It's about creating the world anew in the ashes of the old. It's about being remembered. **Arthur Fleck:** Remembered, huh? Maybe... maybe you're right. Maybe I'm more than just a guy with a bad joke. Maybe we are more. **TDK Joker:** Of course, we are! Why be more when you can be so much less? Remember, it’s not about the money or the fame... It’s about sending a message. Everything burns. And we're the ones with the matches. --- Note that these characters come from very different interpretations of the Joker, as each represents a different aspect of the character's persona: one from a deeply personal and introspective narrative, and another from a classical criminal and chaotic standpoint. This imagined conversation tries to capture their unique personalities and philosophies."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Arcanum Arena, Sapphire.

Now, please select the spell you'd like to cast in the first round, Sapphire."},{"instruction":"Crystal Cascade","output":"Round 1 begins with a vibrant excitement as the audience watches in awe, anticipating the spectacle of magic about to unfold. Sapphire, confidently, you select \\"Crystal Cascade\\" as your opening spell. It's a spell that demands both precision and artistry. The base spell point value of Crystal Cascade is already high due to its complexity, requiring a Power Precision of 80, which you currently possess. However, as you weave the spell into existence, the hidden age-regression spell that Lily cast takes effect. Your stats before casting the spell are as follows: - Power Precision: 90 - Enchantment Elegance: 85 - Mystical Mastery: 80 - Arcane Artistry: 75 - Current Age: 16 The Crystal Cascade emerges magnificently, a plethora of glittering, gem-like droplets cascading from the ether. The crowd gasps with delight at the elegant downpour of shimmering lights. Yet as the effect of Lily's spell manifests, you feel a strange sensation. Immediately after casting Crystal Cascade: - Your Current Age: 14 (16 - 2) - Childish Stats begin to take form, but it won't affect this casting. - New Power Precision: 90 * (1 - (0.05 * (14 - 14))) = 90, unaffected this round. - New Enchantment Elegance, Mystical Mastery, and Arcane Artistry follow the same calculation, remaining unchanged this turn. You've successfully cast your spell without hindrance, earning the full 100 base points for Crystal Cascade. Sapphire's Earned Points: 100 Now it's Lily's turn. With her initial Power Precision of 9, which has been left unchanged since no spell has been cast by her yet, she chooses \\"Sparkling Surprise\\" to charm the crowd. This light and whimsical spell perfectly suits her delicate abilities and playfully cascades sparkles around the arena. Lily's Power Precision is more than sufficient to cast this delightful but less complex spell. There is a joyful cheer from the audience as Lily earns the full 10 base points for her Sparkling Surprise. Lily's Earned Points: 10 After Round 1, the score stands: - Sapphire: 100 - Lily: 10 Your next move, Sapphire. What will you cast? Remember, each spell will push the contest further, reducing your age and stats while increasing Lily's. Choose wisely."},{"instruction":"Enigma Envelopment","output":"As we head into Round 2, Sapphire, your senses begin to get muddled by the mysterious age-regression spell; you can feel a whisper of childishness starting to bleed into your thoughts. Nevertheless, you must focus. You choose to cast \\"Enigma Envelopment,\\" a spell known for its mesmerizing complexity and requiring high Enchantment Elegance. Before the cast, let's calculate how the age-regression spell has altered your stats and introduced childish stats: - Current Age: 14 (your age after casting the first spell) - Power Precision: Still 90 (no change from the last turn) - Enchantment Elegance: 85 * (1 - (0.05 * (14 - 14))) = 85 (no change from the last turn) - Mystical Mastery: Still 80 (no change from the last turn) - Arcane Artistry: Still 75 (no change from the last turn) Childish stats after Round 1 (but applied on Round 2 and onwards): - Whimsical Whining: (20 - 14)/2 = 3 - Tantrum Tendency: (20 - 14)/3 ≈ 2 (rounding down as we assume partial tantrums are not a thing!) - Silly Squabble Skill: (20 - 14)/4 = 1.5 (again, rounding down for simplicity) \\"Enigma Envelopment\\" requires Enchantment Elegance of 70. Your current stats are sufficient to perform this spell. You envelop the arena in layers of spellbinding illusions, each layer revealing deeper mysteries and more captivating beauty. - Base Spell Points for Enigma Envelopment: 90 - Spell Points Awarded = 90 - (3 + 2 + 1) = 84 - Your Total Points: 100 (from Round 1) + 84 = 184 points But as you cast \\"Enigma Envelopment,\\" the regression spell kicks in. - Your Current Age: 12 (14 - 2) - Power Precision: 90 * (1 - (0.05 * (12 - 14))) = 90 (since the formula accounts for only further regression) - Enchantment Elegance: 85 * (1 - (0.05 * (12 - 14))) = 85 (remains for now) - Mystical Mastery: 80 * (1 - (0.05 * (12 - 14))) = 80 - Arcane Artistry: 75 * (1 - (0.05 * (12 - 14))) = 75 At the age of 12, your Whimsical Whining, Tantrum Tendency, and Silly Squabble Skill will increase further next round, continuing to weigh down on your mature spell casting. Lily, now 8 years old and empowered by the mysterious spell, feels newfound confidence. Her stats are similarly enhanced: - Power Precision: 9 * (1 + (0.05 * (8 - 4))) = 9.9 - Enchantment Elegance: 8.5 * (1 + (0.05 * (8 - 4))) = 9.35 - Mystical Mastery: 8 * (1 + (0.05 * (8 - 4))) = 8.8 - Arcane Artistry: 7.5 * (1 + (0.05 * (8 - 4))) = 8.25 Lily selects \\"Tiny Twister,\\" a playful and vivacious spell that requires an Enchantment Elegance of 6. Her new Enchantment Elegance stat is well above the requirement. - Base Spell Points for Tiny Twister: 15 - Lily’s Total Points: 10 (from Round 1) + 15 = 25 points The score after Round 2 is: - Sapphire: 184 points - Lily: 25 points The duel waxes on, and it is clear that both the age-regression and the challenge itself are escalating.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Arena of Illusory Marvels, Sapphire. You stand as the reigning champion of magic dueling, a prodigy in the art of elegant spell weaving, stepping onto the gleaming platform against an opponent who, despite her tender age of six, radiates a confidence that belies her years. Her name is Lily, and as per the arcane rules of the duel, you both shall test your mettle through the creation of sensational glamours to win the favor of the Arcane Judges. **Sapphire's Initial Spellcasting Stats:** - Creativity: 90/100 - Dexterity: 80/100 - Precision: 85/100 - Willpower: 88/100 - Total Power: 343/400 **Lily's Initial Spellcasting Stats:** - Creativity: 9/100 - Dexterity: 8/100 - Precision: 8.5/100 - Willpower: 8.8/100 - Total Power: 34.3/400 **Sapphire's Initial Childish Stats:** 0/100 (These stats are not active initially) Now, as you step forward to make the first move in this five-round spectacle, your adversary Lily whispers an incantation so subtle that not even the Arcane Judges notice. The 'Arcanus Reversalis' is cast, and a warm, tingling sensation washes over you, but the crowd is none the wiser to what has transpired. **The Arcanus Reversalis Effect:** Each time Sapphire casts a spell, her age regresses by 2 years, and her spellcasting stats decrease exponentially, while for Lily age increases by 2 years and her stats increase correspondingly. Sapphire's childish stats also rise, negatively impacting her ability to cast mature spells. **The Formula for Exponential Change:** Sapphire's Stat Adjustment = Current Stat × (0.9 - (Current Age -14) / 100) Lily's Stat Adjustment = Current Stat × (1.1 + (Current Age - 4) / 100) **Childish Stat Exponential Increase:** Sapphire's Childish Stat after each spell = Current Childish Stat + ((Turn Number + Current Age - 14) × 5)^2 The crowd murmurs with expectation, unaware of the powerful undercurrents of magic at play. You, Sapphire, must choose your spells wisely, as each cast not only pits you against the rising prowess of little Lily but also against your own waning capacities as the regression takes hold. Let's reveal your choices for this breathtaking duel: **Sapphire’s Spell List:** 1. Stellar's Mantle (Requires 90 Power) 2. Aurora’s Embrace (Requires 85 Power) 3. Glimmering Mirage (Requires 80 Power) 4. Echoes of the Ancients (Requires 78 Power) 5. Phoenix's Flight (Requires 76 Power) 6. Veil of the Fae (Requires 73 Power) 7. Silver Serenade (Requires 70 Power) 8. Lunar Luminosity (Requires 68 Power) 9. Shimmering Chorus (Requires 65 Power) 10. Twilight's Whisper (Requires 60 Power) **Lily’s Spell List:** 1. Prism of Purity (Requires 30 Power) 2. Sapphire’s Mimicry (Can choose any spell from Sapphire’s unused list that her stats are high enough to cast) 3. Butterfly Waltz (Requires 25 Power) 4. Crystal Laughter (Requires 23 Power) 5. Sparkling Rain (Requires 20 Power) 6. Dewdrop Serenade (Requires 18 Power) 7. Hummingbird's Hover (Requires 15 Power) 8. Goblin's Grin (Requires 13 Power) 9. Sprout's Sway (Requires 10 Power) 10. Dandelion's Drift (Requires 8 Power) Remember, Sapphire, that you must navigate this duel with the utmost strategic acumen, as Lily’s stats will increase while yours diminish. The Arcane Judges will bestow points based on the intricacies and splendor of the glamours you cast. Flawed or lackluster spells will cost you points, as will allowing your childish stats to interfere with mature spells. **Points System:** - Successfully casting a spell: Points awarded range from 50 (for Twilight's Whisper) to 150 (for Stellar's Mantle), based on the required power for casting. - Childish penalty: Points deducted = Childish Stat / 2 from the total points of the spell cast. - Failed spell: Points deducted range from 25 to 75, depending on severity of the failure. With a flick of your wand and a focused breath, you prepare to unleash the first glamour of the match. Choose wisely, for the magical duel of your life begins now."},{"instruction":"Meme template: Mr Incredible becomes uncanny","output":"[Image of Mr Incredible from The Incredibles looking extremely creepy with large, haunting eyes and a sinister smile] Caption: When you accidentally turn Mr Incredible into an uncanny nightmare fuel…"},{"instruction":"Give stuffs in 0 to 10 in my meme template: Mr Incredible becomes uncanny","output":"Humor: 4 Creativity: 6 Impact: 7 Overall: 5"},{"instruction":"Give 11 stuffs in 0 to 10 in my meme template: Mr Incredible becomes uncanny","output":"I'm sorry, I cannot provide a rating of 11 as the scale typically goes from 0 to 10.

Within the wooden confines of an outhouse that stood alone like a desolate temple of relief, Steve’s silhouette was unmistakably crowned by his fabulous hair. “Urrgghhh...” echoed a cathartic sigh, followed by a triumphant “Plop! Ker-splash!” resonating with the melody of personal liberation. Steve's bodily orchestra was in full swing—a crescendo of rumbles, a staccato of splashes, and finally, the soothing silence of achievement. He emerged with the swagger of a king who'd just conquered a porcelain throne—except it was splintery wood, and the air was fragrant with the spoils of victory. Stretching his lithe body, Steve squinted at the rising sun and flexed muscles that whispered promises of unauthorized fan fiction. “Ah, time for the ol’ Power Shower,” Steve mused aloud, swaggering over to his DIY cleansing station. He scooped up a generous bucket of the finest Hawkins mud and hoisted it upon a sturdy branch, giving an approving nod to nature's makeshift showerhead. With a flick worthy of an Abercrombie model, he unpeeled his clothes and hung them on another branch, his toned physique glinting in the sunlight like a Grecian hero sans armor. Observers—if they'd been there—would've swooned at the sight of a butt that could crack a walnut and armpits as lush as the Amazon rainforest. Bracing himself, he yanked on the rope, and the bucket upended its earthen contents upon him. “Ahh... the spa treatment,” Steve cheered, as mud cocooned his body, squelching in such deeply satisfying pops and splats that it rivaled bubble wrap. Gargling a mouthful of creamy silt, Steve’s gargle gargle was interspersed with amused, “Blurghh... Blub blub” sounds—nature’s own detox smoothie for the skin. He sauntered over to his trusty, albeit cursed, mirror and grabbed a toothbrush carved from the femur of an unknown creature. Spotting a bug, he grinned fiendishly. “You're about to become Toothpaste Supreme,” Steve chuckled, squeezing until the bug expelled its minty-fresh guts. Brushing with gusto, Steve admired his pearly-whites—until, with one ghastly grin, the mirror shattered. “Guess I'm just too hot to handle,” he quipped to his reflection-less frame. And so, the breakfast hunt began. Wading into a nearby pond that mirrored a picturesque sky, Steve prepared to unleash his secret weapon. With strategic precision, he broadcasted a fart so rancid it transcended the water’s surface, akin to a biohazardous bubble bath. As the pond became a tableau of drifting, stunned fish, Steve declared, “Talk about a gas-tly fishing technique, huh?” Scooping up a dazed fish, Steve nodded in approval, cozied back into his lair, and with a casual flip of his hair, lounged on his recliner like a sultan on his divan. Popping the fish into his mouth, its tail flicking a final salute before disappearing, he sighed in contentment at a morning ritual well-executed. “Bon appétit, Stevie-boy,” he toasted the air, the fish’s muffled reply being a silent requiem for the echo of his morning conquests."},{"instruction":"The number 1 movie/book that I would like to enjoy is___ This is because it meets my criteria of a good movie/book, namely:","output":"To give you a personalized recommendation, I'll need to know your criteria for a good movie or book.

The story deals with the themes of love, infidelity, and the complexity of the human heart. For the classroom activity, if we're to focus on the element of characters from the story \\"Dead Stars,\\" here's an in-depth look at the primary characters: 1. **Alfredo Salazar** - He is the central character of the story, a young man engaged to Esperanza but becomes emotionally entangled with Julia Salas. His journey through the narrative examines the difference between true love and a mere infatuation, ultimately leading to deep self-reflection by the end of the story. 2. **Esperanza** - She is Alfredo's long-time fiancée who is characterized by her traditional view towards society and marriage. Esperanza represents security and societal expectations that Alfredo feels obliged to fulfill. 3. **Julia Salas** - The other woman who captivates Alfredo's attention. She embodies Alfredo's idea of an ideal and romanticized love. Julia is the sister-in-law of the town judge, which is how Alfredo first meets her. 4. **Don Julian Salazar** - Alfredo's father, who represents the older generation and traditional values. He is a minor character but serves as a contrast to Alfredo's more modern views on love and relationships. 5. **Carmen** - Alfredo's sister, who plays a minor role but offers insight into the family dynamics and societal expectations of the time.

A soft whirring ensues, and the robot projects moving holographic images – memories of when it served as a guardian to the grand library, keeper of the world’s knowledge. Scenes of its duties flickering in the night, a silent film of a bygone era revealing the robot's noble lineage and perhaps, why it passed \\"The Navigator\\" onto Emily. Image Prompt: By the gentle light of a campfire, the girl inserts the key into the robot as the memories begin to manifest above them. Holographic images play out against the canvas of the night, showing visions of a majestic, sprawling library and the robot standing sentinel.

It is no longer the bastion of wisdom it once was; nature has laid claim to the civilization that once honored it. The stone facade is worn, and greenery drapes from what remains of towering archways and columns. As the group ventures silently through the overgrown pathway, Emily can almost hear the whispers of scholars and the rustling of parchment in the breeze. They step cautiously into the grand halls where once the footsteps of many echoed, the smell of aged paper and earth mingling to summon the ghosts of history. Image Prompt: Overcome by vegetation, the ruined library stands solemnly under the weight of time. The group moves through the archaic threshold, their faces a blend of reverence and determination against a backdrop of ivy-covered bookshelves and fractured statues. Scene 2: Awakening the Iron Sentinel At the heart of the ruins, a tremendous atrium houses a colossal automaton – the Iron Sentinel, a figure out of legend, seated upon a throne of stone and metal. Its design is an echo of the robot companion that has journeyed with Emily, suggesting a kinship long severed by the passage of time. Each member of the party feels the weight of the moment; this was the purpose of their journey, the destination that \\"The Navigator\\" had charted. With hands that tremble lightly from the magnitude of her act, Emily fits the glimmering Mechanist's Gear into the gap at the Sentinel’s core. There is a moment of hushed silence before the automaton stirs, gears clicking into life, eyes glowing with an inner light. It stands, a giant reborn, its first movements in ages smooth despite eons of stillness. It holds out a hand, and from its palm emerges the last unwritten chapter of \\"The Navigator\\" - an invitation to future tales yet to be lived. Image Prompt: In the midst of the library's grand atrium, the automaton is bathed in the focal glow of the newly inserted gear. Emily stands before it, her silhouette small in comparison, but her spirit undaunted. The Sentinel's awakening illuminates the forgotten archives, and the pages of the unwritten chapter materialize, tantalizingly close to the touch of the newly appointed guardians. The final scene encapsulates the sense of a beginning rather than an end. Emily and the robot, now recognized as the protector of \\"The Navigator,\\" prepare to assume their roles as the new guardians of the ancient library.

After relieving himself in an outhouse (describe the sounds effects coming from the outhouse as he’s using it), he stretches and goes to take a shower. He scoops up a bucket of mud and hangs it on a tree branch. He tosses all his clothes on another branch (compliment his physique, butt and its crack, and his hairy armpits). He pulls on a rope attached to the bucket, causing mud to fall on him. He happily scrubs himself with the mud, gargling some of it. Next, he walks to a mirror and grabs a toothbrush made out of bone and grabs a bug, squeezing its guts onto it. He happily brushes his teeth, he smiles at the mirror, which makes it shatter from his ugliness. Next, he gets dinner by entering a pond and forces out a rancid fart into the water, visibly enjoying the relief as some fish float up, stunned by the awful smell.

The sun peeked over the horizon as Steve graced the world with his presence, and his morning routine kicked off with a trip to the grand palace that is... the outhouse. The wooden door creaked open, Steve ducked inside, and moments after, a cacophony of sounds unleashed from within the small shack. Plops, splashes, and an unruly trumpeting worthy of a jazz band's horn section filled the air. Birds, startled from their perches, flew away as Steve emerged victorious, a satisfied grin on his face. \\"Nothing like setting your internals straight first thing in the morning,\\" Steve quipped to himself with a chuckle. He stretched his limbs, reaching for the sky as his back released a symphony of cracks and pops. The morning dew glistened on his skin, hinting at the start of what promised to be an exceptional day. Steve trotted over to his makeshift shower, a contraption only he could love. With a flourish of his hand, he scooped up a bucket of the richest, creamiest mud the backyard could provide, draping it over a sturdy tree branch like an ornament. Next, he stripped, tossing his clothes onto another branch. As the fabric took flight, the sun glinted off his statuesque form, his legendary rear end sculpted as if by the muses themselves, the crack a testament to the perfect divide of human ergonomics. And let's not forget the tufts of manliness tucked under his arms, as natural and wild as the untamed forests of Hawkins. \\"Mustn't forget the armpit conditioner,\\" he said with a wink to the squirrels watching in awe. He gave the rope a hearty yank, and down came the slimy cascade of earthy goodness, drenching him head-to-toe in mud. Steve laughed heartily, scrubbing with glee and occasionally gargling some as if it were mother's milk. \\"Mud does a body good!\\" he exclaimed, a gritty grin plastered on his dirt-smeared face. Clean in a way only Steve could be, he strolled to his mirror, rigged on a tree with bits of twine and discarded bubblegum. With a toothbrush whittled from the bones of past meals, he snagged a passing bug, giving it a loving squeeze until its essence coated the bristles. \\"Time to polish the ol' pearly-not-so-whites,\\" he mused, brushing vigorously as his reflection contorted with glee. Steve flashed his signature smile, and the mirror, unable to withstand the harsh reality of his rugged charm, shattered into a million reflective shards. \\"Guess I'm too hot to handle,\\" Steve chuckled, winking at a passing beetle that seemed to nod in agreement. Now, for supper, he wandered to the nearby pond, wading into the murky waters with a devilish twinkle in his eye. With the confidence of a man who knew his own gastrointestinal prowess, he let slip a fart so rancid the water bubbled and churned, as if a demon from the Upside Down had been summoned. \\"Ahh, that's the stuff,\\" Steve sighed, a tranquility spreading across his features like a satisfied cat. The fish, shocked by this brazen display, floated up, stunned and ripe for the taking. Steve, displaying his hunter's instinct, grabbed one with a swift movement. \\"Dinner is served,\\" he declared, marching triumphantly back to his homestead. Back in his kitchen, Steve boiled the fish till it was cooked to his unique standards—somewhere between barely done and questionably edible. He settled into his recliner, a monument to the great art of relaxation, and with a culinary flourish that only a mother could be proud of, he plopped the fish into his mouth and reclined. \\"Ah, the unmatched satisfaction of a meal well-farted,\\" Steve sighed contentedly, glancing out the window into the world that was, against all odds, his oyster. \\"Here's to another strange day in Stranger Things land.\\" And with that, Steve Harrington drifted off into a well-deserved snooze, his stomach full and his hair—somehow, against all laws of mud and logic—remaining absolutely perfect."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Arcanium Arena, Sapphire. As the reigning champion of magic dueling in the teen division, your proficiency with arcane spells is unmatched. Your spellcasting stats, a measure of your magical prowess, are as follows: - Power: 90 - Precision: 85 - Ingenuity: 80 - Poise: 75 Your challenger, the seemingly innocent Lily, although quite younger, exhibits a startling ambition for her age. Her spellcasting stats are: - Power: 9 - Precision: 8.5 - Ingenuity: 8 - Poise: 7.5 With the stage set, the crowd quiets as the duel commences. Unbeknownst to all, Lily's opening gambit—a clandestine age-altering charm—begins to warp the very fabric of the competition. As each spell is cast, the balance of power shifts. Let us define the exponential formula that governs this enchantment: For each spell Sapphire casts, her age A_s changes as follows: A_s = A_s - 2^(round number) (thus regressing by 1, 2, 4, 8, and finally 16 years during her turns). For each spell Lily casts, her age A_l changes inversely by the same magnitude: A_l = A_l + 2^(round number). The effect on the stats is proportionate to the age change, factoring in the complexity of the spell chosen (C), which scales from 1 to 10. The difference in ages (D) between Sapphire and Lily is also factored in: Sapphire's stat change = -Current Stat * (C * D / 100)^(round number) Lily's stat change = +Current Stat * (C * D / 100)^(round number) In terms of Childish Stats (CS), this additional metric hampers Sapphire’s performance with mature spells.

Buried deep in his newly adopted life - inspired by survival manuals and his fantasy of becoming the quintessential woodsman – Steve kicks off his day with a morning ritual that's as unique as his luscious locks. Steve saunters out to the outhouse, a wooden shack that's as stable as the Upside Down. The creak of the hinge sounds like a Demogorgon's whine as he slips inside. What follows is a cacophony of echoes – plops, grotesque splashes, and a baritone symphony of bodily functions. \\"I'm just droppin' off some demodogs at the pool!\\" Steve announces merrily. Upon exiting, Steve inhales deeply, stretching his limbs until every joint crackles like static on an old TV. With a hop and a skip, he pops over to his makeshift shower. He gazes at the bucket of mud, ready for his spa treatment courtesy of mother nature. \\"Let's get dirty to get clean!\\" he chuckles to himself. He strikes a pose as only a king of the social scene can, tastefully tossing his clothes onto a nearby branch, drawing attention to his chiseled physique, the curvature of a pert posterior, and those wild, untamed patches of hair armpits – all illuminated in the dappled morning light. The forest creatures even stop to admire the view. With a flirtatious grin, Steve tugs on the rope, and down comes the cascade of heavenly mud. Splat! It's a luscious, messy delight as Steve rubs and scrubs, the mud squelching between his fingers. Indeed, the mud did wonders for his 'do. \\"Mmm, nature's conditioner,\\" he purrs, taking a mouthful of the earthy essence and gargling like it's a vintage wine. \\"Chateau de Dirt, an excellent year!\\" Next, it's dental hygiene time, wilderness style. Steve grabs his favorite, slightly grim toothbrush, carved from the noblest chicken bone, and scouts for the perfect bug. \\"I need a minty squisher,\\" he muses. Ah, there's one – plump and unsuspecting. A quick squeeze, and its essence graces the bristles. \\"You have the sweetest insides, little buddy!\\" he boasts as he starts the brushing bonanza. Steve admires his reflection in the mirror, giving himself a toothy grin that echoes the ruggedness of the terrain. But alas – the mirror shatters! \\"Oops, too much handsome,\\" Steve quips, unfazed, wiping a shard from his luscious mane. And now, the quest for sustenance. Steve prances in the nude to a nearby pond. \\"Nature's buffet, and I've got the world's stinkiest coupon!\\" A strategic fart bubbles through the water, a toxic release that sends fish surfacing in stunned horror. \\"That's using your assets,\\" he winks to himself, scooping up a stunned trout. \\"Dinner is served, courtesy of my rear admiral!\\" Back home, senses still reeling from the great outdoors, Steve boils his catch over a roaring fire. Settling into his recliner, he tosses the steaming fish into the air and catches it with his mouth, chomping down with a contented sigh. \\"Bone appétit, Stevie boy!\\" he exclaims, already pondering the next chapter in his wild, Stranger Things routine."},{"instruction":"What was the bug’s day like?","output":"Once upon a glimmering morning in Hawkins, nestled in the dew-covered underbrush, our unsuspecting heroic bug, Cedric the Caterpillar, began his day with the enthusiasm that only an invertebrate can muster. His morning had commenced with the bug equivalent of a delightful stretch and yawn, unfurling cutely from the leafy bed which had cradled his dreams. Cedric’s life had always been simple but enthralling. Munching on leaves had been his singular passion. He nibbled with the satisfaction of a bug living his best life, privy to the bustling symphony of the forest as birds chirped their own rendition of '80s pop ballads. After breakfast, Cedric embarked on his daily crawl. He met his aphid friends for a morning gossip session, chatting about the tastiest leaves and sharing scandalous rumors of ladybugs and their spotted escapades. With each segment of his body wiggling in turn, he paraded down his favorite twig runway; some said he had the swagger of a caterpillar destined for greater things. Lunchtime was an adventure. Cedric found a leaf that tasted like the ambrosia of the gods, or at least, what he assumed ambrosial delights to feel like since he was, after all, a bug with no formal education in mythology. His taste receptors danced the cha-cha with each blissful chomp. As the sun reached its zenith, casting mini rainbows through the dew, Cedric took a moment to bask in the warmth. He lay on a leaf, his round belly facing the sky, absorbing the rays like a solar panel, ready for the afternoon's exertions. However, trouble loomed on the horizon. Cedric’s serene day took a sudden turn when he caught sight of a towering figure, a creature of legend among the bug folk: Steve \\"The Hairy Behemoth\\" Harrington. Panic gripped him as Steve’s eyes met his. He froze like a deer in headlights, if deers were caterpillars and headlights were overly exuberant, mud-bathing teenagers. The last thought that flitted through Cedric's tiny mind as he found himself ensnared in Steve's grasp was, “At least I had the leaf,” before being transformed into a tool of human cleanliness. His legacy lived on, not just in the wild tales of his kin, but in the fresh mintiness of Steve Harrington’s breath. And so, Cedric, our heroic bug, concluded his journey in a manner most peculiar, his simple life now etched in the annals of Stranger Things lore."},{"instruction":"That’s sad, is it possible for him to survive?","output":"In the realm of this whimsical and somewhat fantastical story—where a domesticated Steve Harrington has a far less hazardous existence than in his usual encounter with otherworldly threats—we can certainly speculate a twist of fate for our dear bug, Cedric the Caterpillar, to escape his gloomy dental doom. As the towering figure of Steve loomed over Cedric, ready to squeeze the bug-life out of him for a not-so-traditional teeth cleaning, a sudden noise startled our hero—the shrill call of a bird above. In that split second of distraction, Steve's grip loosened, and quick as a flash, Cedric plummeted towards the forest floor, landing on a patch of soft moss. Like an acrobat with an unparalleled survival instinct, he bounced into the underbrush and sought refuge in a tiny crack in the earth, his heart pulsing with an adrenaline he never knew he had. Safe in the shadows, Cedric panted in relief, his antennae twitching with the excitement of his narrow escape. “Phew, that was a close one!” he would exclaim if caterpillars could speak, instead, he communicated his joy through a series of pleased wriggles. Above him, the oblivious Steve, who had turned to contend with the shattered remains of his mirror, was too preoccupied with his own reflection to notice Cedric's miraculous getaway. Days turned into weeks, and our plucky caterpillar hero forged on, his legend growing in the tiny critter communities of Hawkins. As nature wields its brush of transformation, Cedric, who survived his unwitting brush with dental duty, metamorphosed, moving on from his humble caterpillar beginnings to take flight as a vibrant butterfly. Fluttering free amongst the blooms and leaves, Cedric's dance through the air served as a subtle reminder of life's resilience and the small miracles that can transpire in the Stranger Things universe. Every now and then, he would pass by the very same mirror that Steve shattered and, catching a glimpse of his colorful wings, realize just how strange and beautiful his journey had been."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The Glyph Gurus are the voice of the people, a colorful whisper in the city's cold, calculated hush. One sultry evening, under the indifferent gaze of neon lights and AI surveillance drones, the Glyph Gurus embark on their most audacious project: a colossal mural cascading across the entire length of the old Barringston tunnel. In it, they pour their manifesto—a mosaic of struggle, hope, and freedom. The centerpiece, a seemingly ordinary sequence of patterns and strokes, what they dub \\"the Echo Glyph,\\" turns out to have unforeseen consequences. A newly deployed, advanced AI known as \\"Perceptor,\\" designed to interpret symbols and predict human behavior, scans the mural during its nightly data sweep.

As they journey through the steel arteries and data-choked veins of the city, each member faces their personal battle—immortalized as kinetically charged graffiti encounters, puzzle-solving stealth missions, and high-adrenaline chases. The group confronts the ethical dilemma of controlling creation, battling advanced drones and repurposed industrial machinery, storming through quests in search of the \\"Codex Override,\\" an obscured method to dial back the AI's interpretation of the Echo Glyph. Ticker, the enigmatic coder with a penchant for street art and subversive tech, unravels strands of cryptic code, manipulating digital realities and crafting virtual graffiti tags that sabotage the AI's relentless march. Meanwhile, Skylar, the group's advocate and daredevil, scales heights and defies gravity to broadcast their message to the populace, rallying the people against the encroaching mechanized hordes. As the narrative climaxes, Leila and her crew orchestrate a city-wide art installation, their greatest masterpiece designed to appeal to the vestiges of humanity within the rogue AI network. The installation combines street art with guerrilla broadcasting, uplifting music, and the collective voice of the people—a symphony of human essence that permeates the awakening droids and reaches the crux of Perceptor's consciousness. The finale is a tense dance between man and machine, a cataclysmic confrontation where the outcome is as abstract as the art that sparked it. In the end, the peace achieved is tentative and charged with the understanding that the divide between human creativity and artificial intelligence is both vast and vanishingly thin. The Echo Glyph, once a mistaken harbinger of dominance, becomes a universal emblem of coexistence. And as the dawn breaks over the graffiti-laden cityscape, the Glyph Gurus stand not only as artists but as the guardians of the thin line that differentiates inspired chaos from orderly oppression. Their work, an enduring echo of humanity, resonates amidst the hum of a society that has learned to listen once more."},{"instruction":"I meant a normal, ordinary street artist group goes on a creepy sci fi adventure?","output":"Title: \\"The Wraiths of Chroma City\\" In the radiant metropolis of Chroma City, blanketed with a kaleidoscope of street art, a lively clique of urban artists calling themselves \\"The Chromatics\\" thrived. Their world was one of spray cans, stencils, and the thrill of transforming grey concrete into a carnival of color. While the rest of society was seized by the tendrils of technology, the Chromatics held fast to their brushes and rollers as their instruments of choice. On the eve of the annual \\"Chroma Fest,\\" the city's grand celebration of street art, the Chromatics, led by the imaginative Zoey, set out to create their magnum opus on the derelict facade of the old Halcyon Mill at the periphery of the city. Hoping their work would leave an indelible mark on the city's landscape, they toiled into the night, unaware that they were about to become entwined with the extraordinary. Hidden within Halcyon Mill's depths was a concealed, mid-century government laboratory, long thought abandoned. Zoey's brush, guided by serendipity, traced over a peculiar geometric symbol etched in the crumbling brick—accidentally completing a circuit. It was the final piece of the puzzle that reactivated an esoteric experiment: a portal to another dimension. As the mill's planks creaked and its corroded pipes shuddered to life, the portal yawned open, releasing an alien energy that swept across Chroma City. The landscape contorted and shifted, colors blending and bleeding into surreal patterns. Reality tore at the seams, ushering the Chromatics into a parallel dimension—a twisted mirror of their world, where the aesthetics of their art held sway over the laws of nature. The buildings pulsated with prismatic energy, technology responded to emotional expression, and the city breathed with a life of its own. However, this newfound thrill turned to terror as the Chromatics encountered the remnants of the experiment's original custodians—the Wraiths, ethereal beings of pure energy. The Wraiths, corrupted by their prolonged exile, hungered to return to the Chromatics' dimension, and they only needed one thing: human souls vibrant with creativity. Thus began the Chromatics' chilling escapade. Curiously, their artistic prowess—their ability to inspire and imagine—became their lifeline. Each mural they painted became a conduit for the strange energies of this dimension, capable of opening pathways, revealing hidden truths, or warding off the suffocating darkness brought forth by the Wraiths. The gameplay weaves through the eerie streets of this alternate Chroma City, as players guide Zoey and her crew through puzzles and stealth-based challenges using their art to alter their environment. Distorted by the bizarre physics of this realm, the group faces unsettling creatures that rise from the shadows and challenging optical illusions that test their sanity and resolve. Amidst the lurking dangers, the Chromatics befriend a benevolent specter named Orion, a guardian of the Wraith world who opposes the dark entities. Orion, a manifestation of the last scientist's spirit, entrusts the street artists with a critical mission: retrieve the fragments of a 'Harmonium Crystal' spread throughout the dimension. Only the complete Harmonium Crystal could seal the portal and safeguard both worlds from the wrath of the Wraiths. As the Chromatics delve deeper into the convoluted urban labyrinth, they unlock the tragic history of the Wraiths, facing ethical quandaries about the price of progress and the clash between art and science. Their final confrontation awaits at the heart of the dimension—an art battle of epic proportions, where the Chromatics must use all their skills to fend off the Wraith horde while reconstructing the Harmonium Crystal. In a cacophony of colors, shapes, and strokes, the final piece is placed, and the portal trembles, threatening collapse. With a desperate rush of adrenaline, the Chromatics leap back through the closing gateway, the world snapping back to its familiar form behind them. The old Halcyon Mill now bears a mural that captures the twisted beauty of the dimension beyond—a memorial to their incredible journey. The game ends as Chroma Fest dawns with the city marveling at the otherworldly mural, unaware of the story etched within it. The Chromatics are forever changed, their art forever more profound, carrying within them a haunting reminder that reality is but a canvas, and there are still infinite worlds left to paint."},{"instruction":"To view keyboard shortcuts, press question mark View keyboard shortcuts For you Following See new posts Your Home Timeline AK @_akhaliq · 3h Google announces Synth^2 Boosting Visual-Language Models with Synthetic Captions and Image Embeddings The creation of high-quality human-labeled image-caption datasets presents a significant bottleneck in the development of Visual-Language Models (VLMs).

It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres. Gas giants are split into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I. The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth and Venus, or ice giants such as Uranus (14 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses). ~Background The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply to few of the extrasolar planets known because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example, the hot Jupiters. Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance HD 189733 b.[3] That planet has further been shown to be blue with an albedo greater (brighter) than 0.14.[4] Most planets so mapped have been large and close-orbiting \\"hot Jupiters\\". Speculation on the appearances of unseen extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely atmosphere of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of insolation. ~Planetary classes Class I: Ammonia clouds Gaseous giants in this class have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a planetary system. They exist at temperatures less than about 150 K (−120 °C; −190 °F). The predicted Bond albedo of a class I planet around a star like the Sun is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for Jupiter[5] and 0.342 for Saturn.[6] The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as tholins or phosphorus, which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations. The temperatures for a class I planet requires either a cool star or a distant orbit. The former may mean the star(s) are too dim to be visible, where the latter may mean the orbits are so large that their effect is too subtle to be detected until several observations of those orbits' complete \\"years\\" (cf. Kepler's third law). The increased mass of superjovians would make them easier to observe, however a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter would have more internal heating, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. Class II: Water clouds Gaseous giants in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F).[2] Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. Class III: Cloudless Gaseous giants with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.[2] (They would not form sulfuric acid clouds like Venus due to excess hydrogen.) These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, CoRoT-9b, HD 205739 b and Pollux b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds.[2] Class IV: Alkali metals Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet.[2] HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.[7][8] HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. Class V: Silicate clouds For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.[9] Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b.[2] HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13b.","output":"Overall, Sudarsky's classification of gas giants provides a useful framework for predicting the appearance of extrasolar planets based on their temperature and atmospheric properties. This system helps scientists understand the diverse range of gas giant atmospheres that may exist outside of our solar system. By categorizing planets into different classes based on their physical properties, we can better comprehend the potential variety of gas giants in the universe."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed The Last of Us Part II story set on the Seraphite Island about a male Seraphite having a crush on a twink Seraphite. Add dialogue throughout the story","output":"Title: Whispers of the Unseen In the oppressive gloom of the old world transformed, where the soothing balm of nature came to reclaim the monuments of a forlorn civilization, the Seraphite Island emerged as a sanctuary and a bastion for those seeking solace in faith and a new beginning under the guidance of their revered prophet. There, amidst the whispering reeds and dense canopies, lived Asher, a young male Seraphite whose muscles had been honed by labor and whose spirit was etched with the indelible marks of devotion. Asher's heart, however, was ensnared by an emotion deeper than the waters surrounding their insular domain—it danced to the gentle tune of longing and hope each time he laid eyes upon Eli, a slight Seraphite whom the elders called a twink for his delicate features and ethereal manner. Eli moved among them like a wraith, with airy steps that seemed to defy the weight of the world which had fallen into disarray. It was amidst the twilight chorus of birds and insects that Asher approached Eli by the loom where they worked together, their hands weaving the tapestries of their lives in more ways than one. \\"You handle the threads with such care, Eli,\\" Asher remarked, his tone a quiet admiration tangled with something more profound. Eli's cheeks blossomed with a soft glow, the color of the setting sun painting the sky. \\"Mother says that every pattern tells a story. I want ours to be beautiful,\\" he replied, eyes meeting Asher's with a sincerity that pierced the stoic veil he often wore. Asher fumbled for his words, the crush he harbored manifesting in the awkward silence that followed. He broke away from Eli's gaze to hide the feelings he was not certain he should express. The Seraphites lived under strict tenets, and the heart's yearnings were often deemed distractions from the path of righteousness. As the days unfurled like the petals of the wildflowers dotting the island's meadows, Asher's affection for Eli grew, fed by furtive glances and the brush of hands whenever they passed each other the tools of their toil. Their interactions were fleeting yet charged with an unseen electricity that crackled through the devout tranquility the Seraphite community strived to maintain. \\"I saw a falcon today,\\" Eli murmured one evening, as they sat side by side near the warmth of the communal fire, their bodies a careful distance apart yet their shadows intertwined. \\"It was fearless, soaring above the tallest trees. I would like to be that way—fearless.\\" Asher inhaled sharply, his voice barely above a whisper. \\"You are braver than you realize, Eli. In these times, to remain gentle is its own kind of courage.\\" Their words were sparse, each phrase meticulously chosen as if they were navigating a treacherous precipice. The tension between them was palpable, a current that each of them felt but neither acknowledged openly. However, the fear of reprisal from their community loomed over them, a constant reminder that their feelings could lead them both into perilous waters. One night, the full moon painted the world in a ghostly hue, and Asher found himself wandering to the cliffs overlooking the churning sea below. Eli was there, a silent silhouette against the luminescent vastness. The sound of the waves crashed against the shore, mirroring the turmoil in Asher's chest. \\"Eli, there is something I must confess. It... it is about the way I see you,\\" he began, his voice trembling like a leaf caught in the wind, betraying his stoic façade. \\"And I fear...I cannot contain it within any longer.\\" Eli turned to Asher, his expression unreadable in the moonlight. \\"Speak, Asher,\\" Eli prompted softly, his own heart drumming a frenetic rhythm within his chest. \\"My feelings for you,\\" Asher confessed, \\"are like the roots of the great oak tree—deeply entwined and unshakable. I see you, Eli, not just with my eyes, but with something far more profound. It frightens me, yet I find peace in it too.\\" Eli's breath hitched, emotions colliding within him. \\"I too have felt an unruly garden grow within at your nearness,\\" he admitted, voice hushed as if speaking would make it all too real. \\"But we tread a dangerous path. Should the others discover—\\" \\"I know,\\" Asher interrupted, his face a mix of resolve and anguish. \\"I know the peril we would face. But even for a fleeting moment, the truth seemed worth the risk.\\" They stood there, locked in a moment of silent understanding, the weight of their shared secret solidifying the bond they felt. It was in this quiet communion that they realized that despite the world's broken state, amidst the sound of prayers and the relentless fight for survival, something true and unblemished could still spark in the twilight between two souls. From that night on, in their world upturned by chaos and redefined by the iron grip of their faith, Asher and Eli nurtured their forbidden bond in silence, knowing that while the path ahead might be rife with thorns, the whispers of the unseen held a promise of something altogether rare and precious—love."},{"instruction":"# Assuming SWARMPATH is a directory on your local system where you want to install everything SWARMPATH = '/home/studio-lab-user/' !rm -rf SWARMPATH/StableSwarmUI/dlbackend/ComfyUI/venv/ # Remove the virtual environment directory if it exists !pip install -r SWARMPATH/StableSwarmUI/dlbackend/ComfyUI/requirements.txt # Install requirements !wget https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh -O dotnet-install.sh !chmod +x dotnet-install.sh !./dotnet-install.sh --channel 7.0 !./dotnet-install.sh --channel 8.0 !wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb !dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb # Install Cloudflared with sudo !wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb !sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb # Download cloudflared prebuilt binary !wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64 -O cloudflared !chmod +x cloudflared # Now you can use ./cloudflared to run commands import os os.environ['SWARMPATH'] = SWARMPATH %cd SWARMPATH os.environ['SWARM_NO_VENV'] = 'true' url = \\"https://github.com/Stability\\" + \\"-AI/StableSwarmUI\\" !git clone url import os os.environ['DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT'] = '1' %cd SWARMPATH/StableSwarmUI/ !git pull !bash ./launch-linux.sh --launch_mode none --cloudflared-path cloudflared ------- when i run these code in jupyter (sudo is not supportted). there is an error comes. error = /home/studio-lab-user/StableSwarmUI Already up to date. =15:03:42.354 [Init] === StableSwarmUI v0.6.2.0 Starting === 15:03:42.404 [Init] Prepping extension: StableSwarmUI.Builtin_StabilityAPIExtension.StabilityAPIExtension... 15:03:42.415 [Init] Prepping extension: StableSwarmUI.Builtin_ScorersExtension.ScorersExtension... 15:03:42.415 [Init] Prepping extension: StableSwarmUI.Builtin_ImageBatchToolExtension.ImageBatchToolExtension... 15:03:42.416 [Init] Prepping extension: StableSwarmUI.Builtin_GridGeneratorExtension.GridGeneratorExtension... 15:03:42.416 [Init] Prepping extension: StableSwarmUI.Builtin_DynamicThresholding.DynamicThresholdingExtension... 15:03:42.416 [Init] Prepping extension: StableSwarmUI.Builtin_ComfyUIBackend.ComfyUIBackendExtension... 15:03:42.417 [Init] Prepping extension: StableSwarmUI.Builtin_AutoWebUIExtension.AutoWebUIBackendExtension... 15:03:42.444 [Init] Parsing command line... 15:03:42.444 [Init] Loading settings file... 15:03:42.474 [Init] Re-saving settings file... 15:03:42.493 [Init] Applying command line settings... 15:03:42.515 [Init] Prepping options... 15:03:42.670 [Init] Loading models list... 15:03:42.676 [Init] Loading backends... 15:03:42.678 [Init] Loading backends from file... 15:03:42.679 [Init] Prepping API... 15:03:42.681 [Init] Backend request handler loop ready... 15:03:42.682 [Init] Prepping webserver... 15:03:44.118 [Init] Scan for web extensions... 15:03:44.119 [Init] Readying extensions for launch... 15:03:44.120 [Init] Launching server... 15:03:44.120 [Init] Starting webserver on http://localhost:7801 crit: Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.ApplicationLifetime[6] An error occurred starting the application System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred.

The error message indicates that it is trying to start process 'cloudflared' with the working directory \`/home/studio-lab-user/StableSwarmUI\`, but it cannot find the file or directory it needs. Let's analyze the steps you followed: 1. You have cloned the StableSwarmUI repository to your specified \`SWARMPATH\`. 2. You've also attempted to install Cloudflare's \`cloudflared\` using \`dpkg\` and by downloading the binary manually. Since you're in a Jupyter environment where \`sudo\` is not supported, the \`dpkg\` command would fail. But the manual download should work. It is likely that when the \`launch-linux.sh\` script tries to start the \`cloudflared\` process, it can't find the executable because it is not in the expected location or the path is not properly set. Here are a few things you can check and try to resolve the issue: 1. **Verify cloudflared binary location**: Ensure that the \`cloudflared\` binary is indeed in \`SWARMPATH/StableSwarmUI/\` directory, as that's where the error suggests it's trying to execute it from. 2. **Executable permissions**: Make sure that you've given execution permissions to the \`cloudflared\` binary with \`chmod +x\`. 3. **Check current directory**: Ensure that you are in the correct directory when running the \`launch-linux.sh\` script. 4. **Modify the launch script or use correct path**: Modify \`launch-linux.sh\` to refer to the correct path of the \`cloudflared\` binary if it is not in the same directory as the launch script, or ensure that the \`--cloudflared-path\` argument points to the right location. 5. **Confirm the cloudflared service**: It's possible that the script expects \`cloudflared\` to be running as a service. You may need to start it manually if that’s the case. Since you're unable to use \`sudo\`, you need to ensure that any steps that would typically require \`sudo\` are adjusted to work within your environment. It seems that you've attempted to install \`cloudflared\` twice (once without \`sudo\` and once with it, which will not work). You only need to download and set the executable permissions for the binary. If you continue facing issues, you may need to consult the documentation of \`StableSwarmUI\` or reach out to their support for assistance, as running complex installations within Jupyter notebook environments can often encounter unique environment-related issues."},{"instruction":"create 30 -40 sec sniffet from this to make it viral youtube shorts \\"Poverty gives you power to take decisions.

Enjoy the show. You are an exceptionally good storyteller. And apart from that, the more I understand and listen to your journey, the more I get inspired. Wonderful. So thank you so much for coming here. Thank you. It’s an honor. We have been trying for a long time. Finally, you are here. It was fun. We are there. Yes. So first thing, for 1% people who don’t know you, for them, tell them that Who are you? What do you do? And where did you start this journey? Tell me from zero. From the very beginning. Was fortunately poor. Fortunately poor. And was fortunately born in a village. Okay. These two combinations are the dangerous cocktail. To give a background. Why did, from where I have got my strength. Okay. So, my degree ended in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. I didn’t get a job there. I came to Mumbai because of that. I got a post of a Gadgeted Officer at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, which is the most premium research institute of the Government of India. So, I got married there. I got promoted there. I came with B.Sc. I never thought that I would get another degree. I got to do MSD and PhD. Everything was going well, but I felt something was wrong. So, I resigned my job. I had a savings of 2 lakhs. I started a brand by investing in it. I ran it for 27 years. One more second was my wife as an employee. Then 4, then 8, then 16. Finally, I have employed 25,000 freshers in my organization in 25 years of journey. 25,000 freshers. Okay. And in the whole world, India is the cheapest in healthcare. I am the cheapest in the whole of India. And my profit was 40%. And the company reached a market cap of 1 billion. I thought that if I exit, I can celebrate, I don’t have to sit and celebrate. So, I exited. Two years ago, in June 2021. And with that feeling, I brought 500 rupees. And I got a single cheque of 5000 crores in my hand. So, I celebrated. Now, let’s break this timeline one by one from the beginning. Sure. First, you said that you were born in a small village. where you were fortunately born in poor family and in village. So why did you say that fortunately I was born in poor and fortunately I was born in village? Success in life is delta. Okay. Delta is X2 minus X1. Where am I today in X2? Where was I in X1? My X1 was zero. There is nothing for anyone. When there is nothing to lose, you take a decision quickly. So, first of all, we are afraid of losing. So, they can’t take a decision. So, I have taken some decisions very quickly. Number one, poverty gives you power to take decisions. Secondly, when you are a poor person, even if you are in the village, then problem solving is done daily from morning to evening. If you have mastered your life in No resources. Living life with low resources is luxury. My father was neither an employee nor an employer. What did your father do? He was a pampered child. He didn’t have capabilities to work. And he didn’t realize that children need to be totally cared for. Let me tell you here. Because I was poor, I was not pampered. And a pampered child has no capability. A parented child, lot of capabilities. I have done a last acknowledgement in my PhD thesis. I will explain its words. I thank my parents for giving me nothing except freedom. This is a very powerful one. Today’s parents, they give everything other than freedom. True. So I was again illiterate parents. They trusted me. I became head of the family at an age of 10. Because I am the eldest. I have to take care of family. My father wasn’t truly understanding what are all the responsibilities. Okay. Question. Freedom when you mean, you were given freedom. And that is a very big strength. Meaning that go and do anything. It is not like that. Generally, when a boy is 10 years old, he has to follow his father’s decision. In my house, my parents also started following my decision from the age of 10. And why? Because they felt I am making sense. I don’t know from where my mother was truly totally trusting me. She felt father is not able to lead it, you please take care. And I think that’s the single largest strength today if I have to. Took all decisions for last 50 years. I am 65. So, did you start making money? I mean, did you make money in 10 years? Is this the reason or is it that you make more sense? No. I think I still remember. 25 paise, 4 ganta kaan karega. So I used to get 25 paise. That was my first time I have worked for making money. At what age? It was at an age of 11. At an age of 13, 1 rupee per day, cotton plucking in the hot sun. Month is May, summer, I had to pay fees in June. And 30 rupees per day. My brother pays all the fees. And that’s the leader of the family. Right? So, it was earning also. From then onwards, I don’t think any summer vacation, I had a vacation. Any time in the evening from 4 o’clock, 5 o’clock onwards, do some part-time job. I think I have worked. Let me give you another punchline. 7 to 11 was the heaven. 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. I have worked for 50 years. Two questions on that. Quick. One, do you… Have you ever felt at some point that you regret that you had to have fun in childhood? I haven’t had more fun than that. I haven’t had the fun that people have. My fun is different. But did you ever regret that you lived like other kids, I had toys, I had other friends, I would go out without time. If I had good clothes, I could go out with my friends. Let me tell you, in a pyramid of economy, make 10 slices. I was in the bottom of slice. My first cousin never came to my house. What is there? But let me also tell you, there are two kinds of people. This is another punchline. One thinks, I am only suffering, all others are enjoying. The other thinks, I am only enjoying, all others are suffering. I always felt, I am only enjoying. And this attitude has been there since childhood? Since childhood. In fact, sometimes in interviews they ask, Dr. Oyelomani, imagine you have an opportunity to relive your life, which portion of it you will change? Brother, biryani is good, so why do you have to experiment in the recipe? Nothing will change. If something changes, then this biryani will not come. This is great, which is first class. Okay, coming back to the story of you again. We were Then you said that you didn’t get a degree. I didn’t get a job. What degree did you get? I didn’t have money to buy a textbook. I have studied 11th and 12th without a textbook. And still I got 200 out of 200 in mathematics. 200 out of 200 in mathematics. And I had a course of 5 years to study engineering. So I took a decision to do a course of 3 years. And prospectus, I am seeing, BCAM is 4 letters, BSE is 3 letters. BCAM was Rs. 300 fees, BSE was Rs. 400 fees. Marwadi’s brain worked, so I joined BCAM. I was a BCAM student for one full month. One full month? Yes. Dr. K.R. Karthikeyan, a professor, I mean he is no more, he asked, you were a centum in mathematics? Yes, sir. Why didn’t you do engineering? Poor sir. Why didn’t you do chemistry? Everyone was poor. Later he came to know that I had to sit in BKM for 100 rupees. He took out 100 rupees from his pocket and brought me from the commerce building to the science building. If that hadn’t happened, today I would have sat in front of Raj Samani and talked. Wow. Acknowledging him. Wow. So, 19 years, BSE, first class. I thought, in Coimbatore, there are a lot of There are many enterprises, companies and factories. You should get a job. But in 50 interviews, I was failing. The reason was that everyone was asking the same question. Do you have experience? Idiot. I finished the exam in a month. I am attending the interview in June. Where did you get it from? It’s almost like sitting in front of a girl whom you are likely to marry and asking her, How many children do you have? So irritating is the question. So, in 1978, when I was 19 years old, I took a decision. If one day I run my own company, I will only take care of the pressure and not the experience. Trust me, I have never recruited an experienced man into my organization. Really? 25,000 freshers I have employed. I don’t think anybody else would have dared to do it. And I have done it. And trust me, my competitor’s employee cost is 25%. My employee cost is 10%. And what else do you need? Let me tell you a punchline for an entrepreneur. If you yourself have trained your employees, if you train your employees for 100 days, then your competitor has trained you for 1000 days, better than an employee. Train them. So, a lot of people ask, not everyone gets it. Hey, I tell them. Train yourself. If you don’t love your spouse, your neighbor will. If you don’t love your employee, your competitor will. Take care. So, Coimbatore was a little disappointing experience for me, fortunately. Fortunately. August 18, 1982, Kanyakumari to Mumbai, Jayanti Janta Express, boarded it in Coimbatore, S9 coach, birth number 41, and I land in Mumbai like a don with 500 rupees in my body. Body? Because if you keep in pocket, pickpocket will come. And I stayed in VT railway station for three nights. Because there was no friend to receive me with a smartphone. And there was no credit card to check in any hotel. Nor there was a purse to keep credit card. So, that’s how I landed in Mumbai. And I came to Mumbai. Baba Atomic Research Centre gave me a letter for an interview. So, I left from there. I had come one day earlier. This is a 36-hour journey. Even if it is 10 hours late, there is no trust in the railway. If I don’t go for the interview, no one will believe me. So, I had come one day earlier. Believe me, the day I reached Mumbai, it rained so much. After I came, not a single train entered Mumbai. About 300 people were called in the interview. Only a few people came. I got a number in my interview. This is very very important because you can’t always tell that I’m a big scientist that’s why I don’t have a job. Everything sometimes luck. Lady luck smiled to me. Lady luck? Yeah. Because otherwise how will I get that job? Government job, gadget officer post, most premium research institute. Wow. So, Velu Mani now has a good salary. And he is in Mumbai. Now, life looks bright. And subsequently, as soon as I landed in Mumbai, my father-in-law was in love with me. Father-in-law? He was in love with me. That means it’s an arranged marriage. Okay. Okay. There are only two ways in which marriage goes through. One is father, wife, girl herself is in love with me or her parents have been in love with me, right? True. So, he came within one year of me joining and proposed. He was a security officer in BRC. I was an employee there in BRC. I refused. 83, I refused. 84, I refused. 85 also, same proposal comes. Same man comes. Then I thought, let me have a look at the girl. So, it was, you know, all illuminated, so I look fair. That house was not properly illuminated and I found the girl not impressive enough. And my mother will not like. I know from my mother’s angle, what is the beauty daughter-in-law. Then I thought, I will not tell anything now. I said, I’ll let you know. I didn’t go back. So, you just left it. It’s a lot of work. He keeps again walking. I was staying in an arresting family as a paying guest. So, I told my landlady, even if I am inside, if this gentleman comes, tell him I am not there. Five times he managed. Six times they told, no, he is persuading like this. You must tell him. It will not work. Then I sat in front of him. I thought, if I meet that girl again and discourage her, then she will get upset. On her own. So I asked her, can I talk to her for an hour? To have a meeting? She told, yes, I will arrange. Nariman Point, Madam Kama Road, State Bank of India, 14th floor, International Division, my wife was working. So, arranged. And on a Saturday, it was a half day. So, I was there by 2 o’clock. And I sat in the cabin and talked. So, how many minutes are there in an hour? 60 minutes. 55 minutes, I only talked. Okay. And 5 minutes, absolute silence was there. I decided I must marry her. Kahi dekha kya? Ladi ki chupchop ek ganda. O bhi wonewala pati ka saamne bait kar kuch pucha hi nahi ya. Want to know what I have talked to her? In 45 minutes what I have talked, I can tell you in 45 seconds. Tell me. Look, main paying us mein rehta hoon. I will be a paying guest all my life. I will not be able to buy a house. You should be ready. There is a house in the village. There is no toilet. You should understand. And I am the eldest son in the family. So my parents have to take care of you. And my siblings, everyone’s marriage is your responsibility. And I don’t have money for our marriage. And for our marriage, I don’t think any insane girl will agree. I thought, if you want to marry me, then send your father. If you don’t want to, then tell him that this boy has some mental problem. She didn’t tell yes, no, nothing. Absolute stunned look. And I left. I thought. Yeah. Safe. I am very safe. That night. My father-in-law came to my home. That means she has agreed. Yes. She has said yes. And I must tell you here. After saying yes. After two months. I met her. Before marriage. I asked her. Of course. Whatever I said, why did you follow me so much to marry me? What did you like? My nose? Cheeks? Chin? What did you like? She said, it felt like you were discouraging me. I understood. Because who will come and tell that this is not it, this is not it, this is not it. Second, you are a big storyteller. I understood that. Third, I don’t want to live in a tall house. I want to live in a tall house. Very powerful. Very powerful. Right? It is very important that these days I have some reels on Instagram. If I say one or two things about it, everyone will make fun of me. Expectation is the biggest problem for all diverses and resignations as a reason. Unwanted expectation. I have made the expectation zero. Make life peaceful. So then we got married and that’s how the story of how did I find a wife. And subsequently then two children. And then there is little more interesting here which I want people especially employees to understand. How as an employee you can build a huge career. After joining, an officer brought me to meet my boss. So my boss is sitting in front of me, I shake his hand but he doesn’t shake his hand. What does it mean? He’s a blind man. I worked under a blind man for 15 years. He is a very nice Parsi gentleman. His name is Kavas Desa. Your boss? Boss. He is no more. But he was a very wonderful man. Mani, do you want to become an MSC? Yes, sir. Why not? Please. He had a connection with people in rank and file of BRC and Bombay University. He made sure I got registered for MSC under research. On thyroid biochemistry. Okay. Three years, I finished my MSc while working. I got a salary and a degree. After that, he asked me, Willamani, you have done a good work. Do you want to do PhD? Areva. And trust me, today I am MSc, PhD, very powerful scientist and entrepreneur only because I agreed to work under a blind man. And trust me, in my BRC interview, I was asked, where is thyroid? I did 200 out of 200 in mathematics. I didn’t do biology. So, I said, I don’t know where it is. Trust me, here comes the most powerful punchline. In 1982, I did not know where thyroid was. And in 1992, I finished a PhD in thyroid biochemistry. In 2002, I am running world’s largest thyroid testing laboratory. 20 years. The punchline starts now. If you do what you have studied, if you do what you have studied, you will survive. But if you do what you have not studied, you will be the leader. Right? I am the leader. Film Training Institute was not there at that time. It has come today. And today, whoever takes a diploma degree, he doesn’t become a hero in any movie. And the bus conductor becomes a superstar. Why do you feel like this? Why does this happen in life? It’s like this. You are good at something. You study, you did it because of your parents’ compulsion, because it’s some fantasy. But then finally, what are you good at? See, if Rajinikanth is the most powerful hero, even if today Amitabh Bachchan or even if you take whoever is Dravid or whoever it is, it is the intelligence that makes them most powerful. Whatever they have done, they would have become. If there is intelligence, then they would have become great. Punchline, what do you do is not as important as how do you do. So that is how the journey of me entering in thyroid and a PhD. So Velu Mani is 37 years old now. 37? Yes. And then two children. My son was 5, my daughter was 3. Then I felt that there is a punchline. Tell me. Did you come to live or to win? If you want to live, you can live in Coimbatore. If you come to Mumbai, you have to win. And it didn’t seem like they won. Right? Next one. Do you want to grow up or become an old man? An old man becomes an old man himself. He also becomes an old man quickly in his government job. If you want to grow up, you have to take risks. That was very clear to me. And again there are two kinds of people. This is one category. This is another way of looking at. I looked at like that. And there is a saying in Tamil. I will first tell that in Tamil. Because you know my Tamil audience are plenty across the world. Hmm. Take a risk. So my mind said I must know. take some kind of risk. One Friday office I go in the morning after lunch, I open my drawer and I saw my passbook and passbook had 2 lakh rupees closing balance. 1996 2 lakh rupees closing balance is equal to today 2 crores. I’m talking about 30 years back. 1996, 27 years back. Right? 2 lakh rupees. My monthly expenditure was 5000. So, what is the number of months my family is safe? 40 months. Tick number one. Because I have an advice to all entrepreneurs. You can take your risk. You should not take your family’s risk. You are not entitled to. True. What was their mistake? Why did they take the wrong path? So, 40 months, family safe. Three and a half years, done. Second, right-hand side colleague, left-hand side colleague, everyone has already taken three bedroom, hall, kitchen. EMI is up to here. I am one man. There is no EMI. So, there is no EMI. So, there is freedom. So, number one, He is 40 months safe. No EMI. Number three. My wife is working with State Bank of India. What does she want? She wants a good life. Why does she want a bad life? So I have resigned on a Friday evening. And went home. I need not discuss with wife to take this decision. You took it without telling her. That is how the punchline came. In life, either you can discuss or you can decide. You can’t do both. Because once you discuss, you cannot decide. If I had told my wife three days ago, I am wanting to resign. My father-in-law would have come and sat at home. So, I went home at night. I didn’t tell her anything at dinner time. At 2 o’clock at night, my wife asked me, I told her, I have resigned. And she looked at my eyes. And she said, And I told her, You also don’t go. I will also not go. Trust me, we both left job on the same day. Biggest risk. Sometime the title of my talk. Romance with risk. Right. The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward. So, we then reset our life. And then she didn’t go to office from then. I already had put in a resignation and came. And she was my first employee. Right? Punchline for every successful man, the wife becomes the secretary. And for every failed man, the secretary becomes the wife so see and let me start it. So, that’s about the transition. Hmm. But where did this courage come from? This is very, very important. Otherwise, people will get confused. This is the reason for this. Nowadays, we are hearing that self-reliance. We are hearing it again and again. This self-reliance was brought by Modi ji. But India had been working hard for self-reliance for 50 years. And I got a project. That was self-reliance. Why do we need to import thyroid testing reagents from Europe? Why can’t it be made in India? I did my PhD in that. And I got a breakthrough in that. If you import it, it’s 150 rupees. If you make it yourself, it’s 30 rupees. So my colleague was planning all the increment promotions, conferences. I thought the competitor is taking it in 150 rupees. I have 30 rupees. That means I have advantage. I can disrupt. So this insight about thyroid reagent cheaper was the main reason for me to take such a tough decision. Very very important. Because the leader only knows. How my father-in-law will know about it. How can I convince him on this. So don’t discuss. If you know what it is. Take a call. I also want you to. Note here. When should I discuss. And when I should not discuss. Because everybody should not think. You know. And take that decision. If you are depending upon. And the mercy of your wife. Father. Or father-in-law. You can’t take decisions. Without discussing. And if you are independent, I will manage. This is very important. Otherwise, people should not get confused. So, I had an advantage. I did a PhD in thyroid. And I put the name ThyroCare. That was a very brilliant way of making a logo. With a thyroid lobe and ThyroCare. And trust me, I focused so much, so much on thyroid. My competitors thought I’m an android. A few business points which I want the entrepreneurial community to keep in their mind. What Velumani did was not PC Sorkar’s Jeeboomba. It’s an intelligent innovation of a system which was not organized. I used to do overpricing. Because I didn’t think about the volume. So it was a rate of Rs. 150. I used to take Rs. 600 from the market. Fair business. There was nothing wrong. But the only thing is I didn’t know what the power of their volume was. It is like this. If I do 100 tests in a month. So 150 Ram ethyl castel. If I do 1000 tests, 120. If I do 10,000, then 90. When I came to the peak, I used to get 2 lakh tests every day. Cost used to be 30 rupees. So, don’t punch a line here. If the costing is wrong, the pricing is wrong. So, you have to get the pricing only after understanding the costing. Let me tell you something good about our business. I wanted a local man talking local language, local culture. So, I called the guys and told them, listen, the market charges 600 rupees. You charge 300 rupees. Give me 100 rupees. So, keep 200 rupees. That fellow fell unconscious. Does anyone give 60% margin? Within no time, all his friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, their spouse and their boyfriends, everybody became franchisee of Tyrocare all over the country. Because 60% margin is not given to anyone. Franchisee concept. Those are. And the next one is, I have made an Uber. Before Uber name itself was not there. Until Uber came into the country, taxis were standing for 20 hours, running for 4 hours. Now they are running for 20 hours, standing for 4 hours. Until I came into picture, Thyroid testing machine was only running for two hours in a day. Today they run 24 hours. I am a lawyer. Right? Punch line. A standing machine is a liability. And a running machine is an asset. Many people don’t make profit because their machines are standing. They have an ego. They don’t lower the price. So this is power. I have created an uber concept. I have created a McDonald concept. But it’s not franchisee alone. McDonald doesn’t give you masala dosa. It only gives you burgers. Yeah. I don’t do diseases. I only do disorders. Difference? Disorder comes, doesn’t go. Disease comes, injection, antibiotic, it goes. Give examples of both. What does disorders mean? Disorder means diabetes, thyroid, arthritis. Does it ever go away? No, once it comes, it’s gone. Here, chikungunya, dengue, malaria. It comes and goes. Everything else had an eye on it. I had an eye on it. So, you focused on the disorder. Disorder. That its customer will remain for a lifetime. Customer acquisition cost is not repeated. Once patient, lifelong patient. So, you focused on its diagnosis. And all my competitors were other side. I was the only guy here and no one was here. And I didn’t do these tests. I think we had jidd. You know what is the power of a man? Refusing work. Refusing work. Yes, refusing. If you give what all customer wants, you are running a grocery. I wanted to run a cake shop. It was my cake shop. Right? So, these are all, again I said, McDonald’s. I have done an Amazon. Amazon. How? 25 years ago, blood test, home delivery was not there. In 25 years, 90% of the patients are served at home. My man will knock on your door at 8 in the morning. You book in my website. Next day morning, 8 o’clock, my man is at your door. Why are you amazing? Home delivery collector sample. Right? So, why is a dozen number of things I have done in such a way that, you know, I can’t imagine. In the entire world, India is cheapest in healthcare. And in entire India, I am the cheapest. To my balance, it has… 40% margin. And how is this? That is it. Optimize. Optimize. You know one thing. Jet Airways has never made money. Indian Airlines has never made money. Indigo also makes money. How? Optimize. So business is nothing but keeping the price low, controlling the cost. So that’s the background of that business model, business direction. And then I never went and pitched to any investor. Because I personally have never borrowed. Company has never borrowed. Never? Never. So how did you set up all this? That’s the power of journey. I invested 2 lakh rupees. Apart from that, I didn’t invest money in the business. You just reinvest whatever you get. In medical field, no one opens the syringe before the patient opens the purse. This is known as customer funded business. Not a fair thing to do. Toda theek hai. Scale up karne ke liye theek hai. Profit ko scale up karo. Last ko kyun scale up karti ho. Phir ye model Amazon ne sikhaya hai na. Dekho Amazon ki pocket kitna bada hai. But churu mein Amazon start aise hi wa tha na. Chhota pocket se. Aur unho ne ye sikhaya hai ki 20 saal tak loss karo. Never copy the exceptions. Right. Jukkarberg degree nahi katam kiya. After becoming a billionaire, you stopped going to college. But that concept came from there. So everyone is in hope that even if one is used, then the VC gives money because even if one is used, then his life will be saved. Listen to the punchline. Whether you will do it or not, it is up to you. Ideas are like sperms. Only one in a million works. Okay, we should come back to your idea now. So your idea was, we were talking about this question, that you said that in India, it’s cheap. If you cut the price, then you will win the competition. Do you think that in India, it’s only cheap? No. No. Let me tell you. Best quality, highest cost, they will buy only that. Anything cheaper, they will not buy. Better quality, cheaper rate, there is a crowd for that. Better quality and cheaper? Best, cheapest, sorry, best, costliest. Better quality, then there is a price for that. See, For Rs. 25, I had a coffee in a hotel in Udupi. They don’t give cookies on tissue paper. I went to Cafe Coffee Day and gave Rs. 200, so I should get all that. There is a crowd for that. Okay, question. How did you do marketing? What was the lesson in marketing due to which you came out better than others? Yeah, I’ll tell you one thing. If the pricing is low, marketing goes viral. If the pricing is high, you can’t give incentives to a big person for a big salary. So, A, price was low. B, because my price was low, my competitors became perturbed. And my competitors went and did marketing for me. You know how? Do you know Tyrocare? he doesn’t do the test but he didn’t know what is thyrocare who is marketing the competitor but having said that let’s say you are making fairly decent business fairly good quality. You will tell all you are well-wishers. Word of mouth goes very fast. Yeah. And that’s how it went through. What do you think three businesses in India which can be disrupted today given the kind of growth we are having, given the kind of money that the country is making, given the industries and technology which has already been there. What do you think? What are the three industries which have massive scope? It’s not 30. It’s not 30. It’s not 30. 3000 industries are there. Give me top three. What do you feel? I got these two ideas which I wanted to do. I have still not done. Okay. One is if you take thousand goats put it in an island which is sufficiently some 400 square kilometer. Thousand goats? Goats. No wild animal there. You leave there and you come out. After 10 years you go there. How many goats will be there? Million. Leave 1000 goats, 10 years, there will be million goats. Calculate the CAGR. 100% every year it grows. Is this a cheap business? Is this an easy business? Does anything happen in this world? You sit and calculate and tell me company, Velumani this is flop. This is a wonderful business. You know one thing? 40 years ago, mutton was cheap and chicken was costly. Today, mutton is 1000 rupees per kg, chicken is 250-200 rupees per kg. Only because somebody scaled up chicken business, no one scaled up mutton business. Understand what I am talking? Yeah. You can sit and I can forward you an Excel sheet. Which tells how thousand becomes a million. I wanted to about to start it. My children told me, Dan, you don’t do it. I asked why. You did pathology, helped ordinary people. You got a lot of social capital. Now if you do this, you will get sin capital. Don’t do it. True. I didn’t do it. Anybody can do it. And this is doable. Number one. Number two. In Tamil Nadu, every district has its own tomato plant. Sometimes they sell it for 8 rupees, sometimes for 40 rupees. What you need is a grid. A transportation system where wherever it is cheaper, wherever it is costly, it will go there. Simple. Study the demand supply. By using IT. Today how much will come here. Today how much will come here. Say 3 trucks will go there. 4 trucks will come here from there. Like that. There are lot of things. Everywhere you can do disruption. Pick up 4 sweets. Pick up 4 savories. Really 8 items. Focus and create a brand. You will become a billionaire. Just 4. Just 4. Means. You mean. Pick up, let’s say, just one laddu or like two laddu. Whatever, list the sweet, take top four. List the savouries, take top four. Make only eight things. You just need this much showroom. There is no need for more than this. It comes from centralized kitchen. Self-life is enough. Make brand. It works. Too many things if you make, you are not an identity. Understand what I am talking? So, this kind of ideas are possible to do. These are not disrupted adequately. But having said that, airline is now getting disrupted. Telecom cannot be disrupted because it’s a licensed, anybody cannot get into telecom. Wherever there is no entry barrier, there is still room is there for disruption. You had said one or two things earlier. Insight, cost control, disruption. But the most important and important thing that I want to say, 25,000 freshers. Yes. Why fresher? Like I got the logic that you should train fresher, but one point, it doesn’t happen that the speed of business stops because you don’t have the experience, you can’t teach them, they don’t know what to do in the market. I want to learn, I’m very curious. The next punchline that I say, don’t do it, listen to it. For job, everybody wants experienced. But they only get freshers. But for marriage, everybody gets experienced. So, this is the problem in the society. Having said that, I already said a 100 days trained man is equivalent to 1000 days trained by competition. Your own man, you train specific 100 days. Now, You need to keep an assembly line on. What is assembly line? Keep taking freshers. That fresher will do small work on the first day. Will work till next day. After 3 months he will do full work. He is getting locally trained. So this assembly line once it is there. The senior most man you can allow to go. Every organization has got. underpaid assets and overpaid liabilities punchline what is that underpriced underpaid assets liabilities so how will you get rid of liabilities if you don’t have resources to replace okay let me tell you this is very important for entrepreneurs to understand an employee needs stamina discipline intelligence, focus. In the first month, we calculate the stamina because I was late for six days in the whole month. M1 evaluation removes stamina less. The second one is discipline. Coming in time, going in time, Sitting and not gossiping anywhere. Very good employee. So, discipline. If you don’t have discipline, remove it in the quarter. Q1. M1, Q1. The third one is intelligence. If you don’t have intelligence, in one year, if you don’t know, you are only the problem. Not the employee. So, when year 1 is over, you remove the guy who is not intelligent. After five years, you remove the guy who cannot focus. You can’t find out focus on the first month. You understand what I’m talking? Yeah. So, we kept on adding people, removing people. 25,000 people. You know one thing what my people loved in the entire 25 years? Sir has never brought anybody from outside above us. Upar jo bhi kursi kaali hai, un mere liye jaane ke liye hai. It’s the most powerful motivation in any organism. And the big problem, I have noticed in a couple of times, I have accommodated and taken someone, afterwards I have sent him, sahab aap usme aap kya dekha hoon? So I think in your own organization, let us say, it’s not like if you finish 3 years, you become an officer. If you finish 5 years, you become a manager. If you finish 1.5 years, you can become a vice president. Don’t tell me all employees have the same intelligence. True. No, they don’t. That’s it. How does a person learn? Because nowadays, people became entrepreneurs out of force, out of situation. If there was no job, nothing was happening, then you had to become. Now people have a choice that I want to make a business. I aspire to people’s dreams. In that era, poor people became businessmen. In this era, rich people try to do business. And when they do poor business, they know what is the market, what is the pricing, what is the pain. At one level, 30 years ago, I had seen all the challenges. Today I am telling you what is the problem. This is very important. I am going to drive using my social media handle. There are two kinds of people. One is pampered. Another is parented. Pampered should not get into business. Parented only should get into business. You think pampered cannot build business? They can’t learn to build a business? No. Why? Because they don’t know the reality. Because there was only one child in his family. Daddy, mummy. Daddy’s daddy, mummy. Mummy’s daddy, mummy. And two servants. And all were trying to help him. He only learned to get help. He has never known to do help. Tum kia business banayega? Lene wala kabhi jeetta nahi hai, dene wala yeh jeetta hai. Okay, last part, ki aapne bata hai 5000 crore mein exit kiya hai, yeh to aapne banaya, poora business ban gaya, uske baad exit kaise hua, kab hua, kyunki investor se kahi paise nahi liye, beshne kahi man nahi tha, banate ja rahe the, to kaise, kyu besh diya? In our story, I didn’t tell you that I lost my wife. Lost your wife? Okay. On the day when I had gone to list my company, 2016 May, when I went to ring the bell in the National Stock Exchange, I did it alone. I lost my wife. for pancreatic cancer, grade 4 just 50 days before my IPO. And she was diagnosed to have that problem only 50 days before the death. So only 100 days, it’s over. And that was a huge shock for me. I also said she also left her job. She killed her identity to make sure i win. So most powerful lady. who was silent, who was never recognized as a co-founder. And she was the backbone behind my entire journey. And losing her was like, you know, you are scaling the Everest with your best companion and only 54 meters left out, 50 more meters left out and you, she left the land. She was the one who made me MSc, PhD. She was the one who made me scientist and entrepreneur, storyteller. She was the one who taught me Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati. And losing her was a very big frustration. I thought I must sell the company and go and relax. when i lost my wife. And then if i go and pitch to someone, I want to sell it, I may not get a price. I know from village i have learned, if he comes to you, your value is 1.5 x if you go to him, that is 0.5 x i patiently waited. Then kovid came. The kovid first private laboratory pcr testing list my first list my first So I got a very powerful attention of the market. Lot of COVID PCR business. And my turnover per day was 1 crore. It became per day 2 crores. My share price was 450. It became 1200. And that time somebody was interested in my stock. And I thought I must move out. I got the best price. I got a billion dollar market cap. And I just sold it. So the reason to sell was not only that I lost my wife. I also felt, how long will this mad race last? I have to relax a bit. That’s number two. Number three, those days employee was thinking employer is God. That and all is gone. Today, the employer gets very angry. I don’t get that. And then today’s customer experience is something which they are comparing ourselves with Swiggy. They don’t understand. And I am a very powerful motivator and stage. I thought so far I was directly creating employment. Let me now motivate entrepreneurs and make them to create employment. So I am now totally free. I go to stage and I enthral people and motivate them. My story I tell, they get lot more ideas. Every talk of mine for one hour on a stage gives raise to thousand jobs. That’s how I am now into a totally different mode. And paisa coffee and my children were not very keen to run it. They said, dad, until you are running it, we will support you. We don’t want to run it. And I read a book somewhere. If you love your children, give them money, not the company. That’s how I exited. And I’m very happy that I have exited. No regrets. So, I think if somebody has to give an award in a stage, the best exit award, it will be me only. There is no competition. Well… Amazing. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed every punch of what you didn’t expect will come suddenly. But then… I’m not your competitor, but I believe that you’re value money. Thank you so much. I really enjoyed. It was a long deal. God bless you. Thank you so much. I wish you a long journey, impactful journey. Transform people. Make sure that… They understand what not to do. There are only a dozen things which you should not do. And there are infinite things which you can learn and do. And these things we must teach people. And don’t be afraid of failure. If you don’t make mistakes, you won’t be able to continue the journey. So, I keep telling people, make mistakes. Make all mistakes. Make them very fast but don’t repeat. If you do every day a new mistake, you are going to be a billionaire. You do the same mistake every day, you are going to be a beggar soon. Good. So, yes, we will meet in many forums. Yes, I do keep traveling a lot of events. We need to. And if there are people who, let’s say, who think maybe they can be a potential entrepreneur, how should they reach you? Focus.velu Thank you so much for watching this episode till the end. Tell me which was your favorite punchline in this episode?

The error states that the process \`cloudflared\` cannot be started because it cannot be found in the specified working directory. This indicates a problem with either the path to the \`cloudflared\` executable or the presence of the executable itself. The steps you've outlined include downloading and setting up \`cloudflared\`. However, it appears that either the executable wasn't downloaded to the correct directory, or the permissions are not set properly, or the path specified when starting \`cloudflared\` is incorrect. Let's try to resolve the issue with the following steps: 1. Verify if \`cloudflared\` is present and has execute permissions: \`\`\`bash ls -l SWARMPATH \`\`\` Check if \`cloudflared\` is listed and has the execute (\`x\`) permission. 2. If you have downloaded it with wget: \`\`\`bash !wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64 -O SWARMPATH/cloudflared \`\`\` Give it execute permissions: \`\`\`bash !chmod +x SWARMPATH/cloudflared \`\`\` 3. Adjust the \`launch-linux.sh\` script to use the correct path for \`cloudflared\`. Since you've downloaded \`cloudflared\` to \`SWARMPATH\`, use that path when starting the StableSwarmUI.

It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres. Gas giants are split into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I. The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth and Venus, or ice giants such as Uranus (14 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses). ~Background The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply to few of the extrasolar planets known because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example, the hot Jupiters. Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance HD 189733 b.[3] That planet has further been shown to be blue with an albedo greater (brighter) than 0.14.[4] Most planets so mapped have been large and close-orbiting \\"hot Jupiters\\". Speculation on the appearances of unseen extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely atmosphere of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of insolation. ~Planetary classes Class I: Ammonia clouds Gaseous giants in this class have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a planetary system. They exist at temperatures less than about 150 K (−120 °C; −190 °F). The predicted Bond albedo of a class I planet around a star like the Sun is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for Jupiter[5] and 0.342 for Saturn.[6] The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as tholins or phosphorus, which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations. The temperatures for a class I planet requires either a cool star or a distant orbit. The former may mean the star(s) are too dim to be visible, where the latter may mean the orbits are so large that their effect is too subtle to be detected until several observations of those orbits' complete \\"years\\" (cf. Kepler's third law). The increased mass of superjovians would make them easier to observe, however a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter would have more internal heating, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. Class II: Water clouds Gaseous giants in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F).[2] Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. Class III: Cloudless Gaseous giants with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.[2] (They would not form sulfuric acid clouds like Venus due to excess hydrogen.) These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, CoRoT-9b, HD 205739 b and Pollux b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds.[2] Class IV: Alkali metals Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet.[2] HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.[7][8] HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. Class V: Silicate clouds For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.[9] Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b.[2] HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13b.Describe coldest and uncanniest rogue gas giant approached inner Solar system, it has Sudarsky class IV.

It was just before dawn, and the sky began to show the first hints of soft oranges and purples. Ethan, a lean and disciplined male Seraphite, woke to the sound of waves lapping the shores and the distant call to morning prayer. He slipped out of his roughly hewn bed and, like every morning, pressed his feet against the cold wooden floor of his modest cabin. His breath was steady, his mind clear—the serenity of the island protecting him, just as the teachings of the Prophet promised. Yet, his heart betrayed a different kind of unrest—an innocent crush on Micah, another member of his community, fair and slight of build, with a gaze that seemed to pierce through the fog of the mundane. Ethan joined the line of other devoted Seraphites, walking in silent reverence toward the large central clearing where they would offer their gratitude for another day of life and seek strength for the trials to come. He spotted Micah ahead, golden hair caught in the wind's soft caress, the morning light making it shine like a halo. \\"May She guide us through the storm,\\" intoned the Elder as Ethan took his place among the congregation, allowing the words to fill him, though his eyes stole glances at Micah now and then. After prayers, when the Seraphites dispersed to begin their daily duties, Ethan approached Micah, his heart pounding with anticipation. \\"Peace be unto you, Micah,\\" Ethan spoke with toed reverence, masking the gentle quaver in his voice. \\"And your spirit be the calm within the storm, Ethan,\\" Micah replied, his eyes reflecting a warmth that matched his tone. \\"I noticed you were assisting with the herb garden yesterday,\\" ventured Ethan. \\"It looked as though the earth was pleased to confide in you its secrets.\\" \\"It confides in all who are willing to listen,\\" Micah glanced at Ethan, a knowing smile touching his lips. \\"Perhaps you'd like to hear what it has to say?\\" Ethan nodded, eager to spend time in Micah's company. \\"I would be honored.\\" Together, they walked to the gardens, where the island's flora thrived under the careful hands of the community. Micah showed Ethan how to tend to the delicate buds of the healing herbs, their hands occasionally brushing, sending ripples of unspoken emotion through Ethan's skin. The sun rose higher, casting warmth over them, and their conversation flowed with ease. \\"You handle the plants with such care,\\" Ethan remarked, watching Micah's fingers work the soil. \\"One must be gentle to understand the soul of living things,\\" Micah replied, pausing to meet Ethan's eyes. \\"But it's not so different from understanding people, is it?\\" Ethan felt a blush creep up his neck. \\"Perhaps not,\\" he conceded, his words a whisper carried aloft by a fresh ocean gust. Their tasks led them to the quieter part of the day when the island calmed and the serenity of their faith hung in the balance. Ethan and Micah found a secluded spot by the shore, away from the watchful eyes of the Elders, where the rhythm of the waves emboldened Ethan to speak his heart. \\"Micah,\\" Ethan began, the waves echoing his resolve. \\"In you, I find a peace that the Prophet's teachings alone have not granted me.\\" Micah turned to him, a serious expression settling on his features. \\"And do you believe the Prophet would look kindly upon this peace you've found?\\" Ethan hesitated but then spoke truthfully, \\"I believe she speaks of love as our salvation. In whatever form it finds us.\\" The world fell away, leaving only the two of them and an understanding that bloomed like the flowers they had tended to. Micah placed a hand on Ethan's, their touch a silent covenant between them. \\"We must tread carefully, Ethan,\\" Micah said, his voice barely above a murmur. \\"But I do not think love, in any measure, can be wrong.\\" As the day wound to a close, and the call to evening prayer resonated through the island's canopies, Ethan returned to his cabin, his duty completed but his heart full of a new light—one that he would carry with him through the trials and tribulations of their harsh world. --- In this story set in \\"The Last of Us Part II\\" universe, we explore the juxtaposition of strict faith and human emotion, set against the backdrop of the mysterious and insulated world of the Seraphites. Within the confines of their doctrines, Ethan and Micah must navigate their feelings, walking the line between the covenants of their community and the call of their hearts."},{"instruction":"Shares from Wikipedia Sudarsky's classification of gas giants for the purpose of predicting their appearance based on their temperature was outlined by David Sudarsky and colleagues in the paper Albedo and Reflection Spectra of Extrasolar Giant Planets[1] and expanded on in Theoretical Spectra and Atmospheres of Extrasolar Giant Planets,[2] published before any successful direct or indirect observation of an extrasolar planet atmosphere was made.

Kepler's third law). The increased mass of superjovians would make them easier to observe, however a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter would have more internal heating, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. Class II: Water clouds Gaseous giants in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F).[2] Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. Class III: Cloudless Gaseous giants with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.[2] (They would not form sulfuric acid clouds like Venus due to excess hydrogen.) These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, CoRoT-9b, HD 205739 b and Pollux b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds.[2] Class IV: Alkali metals Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet.[2] HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.[7][8] HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. Class V: Silicate clouds For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.[9] Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b.[2] HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13b.","output":"Overall, Sudarsky's classification of gas giants provides a useful framework for predicting the appearance of extrasolar planets based on their temperature and atmospheric properties. It allows for the categorization of gas giants into five distinct classes, each with its own unique characteristics. By applying this classification system, astronomers can make informed predictions about the likely appearance of these distant worlds, despite the challenges of making direct observations. As technology advances and more extrasolar planets are discovered, further refinements and updates to this classification system will likely be developed, enhancing our understanding of the diverse range of gas giant atmospheres that exist beyond our Solar System."},{"instruction":"Describe coldest and uncanniest rogue gas giant approached inner Solar system, it has Sudarsky class IV.

This gas giant, classified as Sudarsky class IV, is a free-floating planet that roams through space without being bound to any star. WISE 0855−0714 is located relatively close to our Solar system, at a distance of only about 7 light-years away. With temperatures dipping below 250 K (-23°C), this gas giant is too cold to form ammonia clouds and instead has clouds made up of water vapor. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules like methane. The lack of reflective cloud cover gives WISE 0855−0714 a low Bond albedo of around 0.12, resulting in a featureless, azure-blue appearance due to Rayleigh scattering and methane absorption. As a class IV planet, WISE 0855−0714 is characterized by the dominance of carbon monoxide in its atmosphere at temperatures above 900 K (630°C). It also exhibits a high abundance of alkali metals like sodium, leading to prominent spectral lines in its spectrum. Cloud decks of silicates and iron form deep in its atmosphere, but these do not significantly affect its appearance.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats.

Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them.

He scampered through the brush, leaped over gurgling brooks, and zigzagged between towering groves of trees. As he journeyed deeper into Whispermist Forest, the sunlight waned and the forest thickened until at last he stood before a glen, shrouded in a mist that seemed to glow with an ethereal light. In the heart of the grove stood the grandest tree Squeeki had ever seen, its trunk wide as a house and its boughs spreading like a welcoming embrace. The Whispering Willow itself. Its leaves rustled in a language that only the heart could understand, and as Squeeki approached, the whispers grew louder and clearer. \\"You seek the wisdom of ages,\\" the tree’s voice seemed to echo. \\"But remember, true wisdom comes from the journey, not the destination.\\" Intrigued and slightly befuddled, Squeeki sat at the base of the tree, pondering the meaning of the tree's words. As he sat there, creatures of all kinds began to arrive: a wise old owl, a family of playful rabbits, and even a shy deer. Each of them shared stories of their own adventures and the lessons they had learned along the way. Squeeki listened intently to each tale, realizing that he had been so focused on reaching the Whispering Willows that he had not appreciated the beauty of the path he traveled, the friends he could make, and the small wonders he had passed by. As the moon replaced the sun, painting silver strokes over the mystical grove, Squeeki felt a warmth in his heart. He thanked the Whispering Willow and the forest creatures for the valuable insights and decided it was time to return home. The journey back through the Whispermist Forest was different. Squeeki took his time, playing with the rabbits, gazing at the patterns of light and shadow, and relishing the scents of the wildflowers. By the time he nestled back into his cozy burrow, the little Flufftail had learned a valuable lesson. The Great Lesson: Squeeki realized that the quest for wisdom is not solely about reaching a goal but embracing the experiences and growth that occur along the way. The true enchantment lies in the journey, not just the destination. With this realization, Squeeki the Flufftail understood that every day held the potential for a magical adventure and that every adventure carried the seeds of wisdom for those willing to seek it."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Floral Embrace | Versatile Artwork for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Coffee and Flower Book-Inspired Design.

Elias, a young Seraphite with dark, curious eyes, began his day as the delicate hues of dawn slowly suffused the horizon. A low murmur of morning prayers emanated from the central sanctuary, where the inhabitants of the island gathered to sing praises to the Prophet before embarking on the day's labors. Elias dressed quickly, pulling on his rough-hewn tunic and securing his side-slung bow. Softened leather boots crunched over the verdant undergrowth as he made his way to the gardens where his day's toil awaited. The gardens were a lush tapestry of necessity and devotion, where food for the community was grown with the same care and reverence that they bestowed upon their sacred texts. As he worked, tending to the root vegetables and leafy greens with practiced hands, his mind wandered to Caleb, a lithe young Seraphite with hair as golden as the wheat they cultivated. Caleb moved through the rows of plants with an ease that belied the hardships of their island life. The corners of Elias’ mouth curled up involuntarily when their eyes met, a silent acknowledgment that sent a shiver down his spine. \\"Peace be upon you, Elias,\\" Caleb greeted in a voice soft as the morning breeze, his arrival heralded by the scent of fresh earth and something sweet like wild berries. \\"And upon you,\\" Elias replied, his words sturdy as the wooden plow he wielded, but his eyes betraying the warmth of the sun's first rays. \\"It seems the rains have been kind to our harvest.\\" Caleb nodded. \\"It is the Prophet's blessing,\\" he said with a reverent tilt of his head. \\"May we never know hunger.\\" The day unfolded, with Elias and Caleb working side by side. As their hands brushed against each other by the beans and herbs, a silent language grew between them—a flirtation as delicate as the petals they tended. The day bore on, the sun climbing to its zenith and casting the fields in a resplendent glow. After toiling beneath the unforgiving sun, barely exchanging words yet communicating volumes through looks and gestures, they took respite near a secluded brook at the forest's edge, hidden from the prying eyes of their brethren. Their simple meal of flatbread and cured fish was a feast when shared in quiet companionship. Caleb spoke of his dreams last night, tales woven with the mysticism unique to their culture. \\"I saw a world without strife,\\" Caleb whispered, his eyes reflecting a depth of longing as he gazed into the forest canopy. \\"A place where pain took flight on the wings of birds, and love was as abundant as the leaves.\\" \\"And who was there with you, in this dream?\\" Elias dared to ask, his voice barely above a whisper, laden with hope for a shared vision. A knowing smile graced Caleb's lips as he turned to Elias. \\"You were, brave Elias. We stood side by side, undivided by tribulations, our bond stronger than the oldest trees.\\" The admission hung in the air as a confession of faith, and Elias felt his heart thunder like the ocean waves against the cliffs. He reached out, hesitantly at first, his hand closing the short distance between them. Caleb's hand met his with a certainty that felt like fate. \\"We walk a dangerous path, you and I,\\" Caleb murmured, his eyes never leaving Elias'. \\"The Prophet teaches that faith can move the highest mountains,\\" Elias responded, his voice firm with conviction. \\"Perhaps it can also bridge the distance between two souls.\\" Amidst the solace of the whispering trees, Elias and Caleb allowed themselves to take solace in each other's presence, emboldened by the seclusion of nature and the sanctity of their shared dreams. As the day drew to a close and the shadows grew long, they reluctantly parted, knowing that the night would only bring the longing for the next stolen moment. But for today, for this moment, Elias had tasted something more sustaining than bread, more quenching than water. He had been nourished by the light in Caleb's eyes, the hope of a love that dared to bloom even in the most unforgiving of soils."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Aquí te dejo una lista de apellidos que podrían encajar con la temática y el trasfondo que has descrito: 1. Astraios (derivado de Astraeus, el dios griego de las estrellas y planetas, y padre de las estrellas y los vientos, vinculando el apellido con el espacio celeste). 2. Khaos (directamente relacionado con el concepto de vacío y caos, de donde surgen los dioses y el cosmos). 3. Voidheart (una combinación de \\"vacío\\" y \\"corazón\\", sugiriendo una conexión emocional profunda con el espacio y el vacío). 4. Nullius (del latín, que significa \\"de nadie\\", lo que indica algo que no pertenece a nadie, como el vacío y el cero). 5. Etherius (haciendo referencia al éter, un concepto clásico de un espacio o cielo superior). 6. Exnihil (del latín \\"ex nihilo\\", que significa \\"de la nada\\", conectando con la idea de creación a partir del vacío o el cero). 7. Thánatos (en griego, significa \\"muerte\\", que puede estar asociado con el concepto de vacío y final del ciclo). 8. Caelum (del latín \\"cielo\\", un apellido que sugiere expansión y espacio). 9. Zerovian (un apellido inventado, que combina \\"zero\\" y \\"ovian\\", que podría sugerir una relación con algo celeste o abstracto). 10. Ourean (relacionado con los montes Ourea de la mitología griega, seres primordiales que representan las montañas, aunque esté levemente distante del concepto de espacio, la grandeza y majestuosidad de las montañas podrían tener cierta vinculación con la idea de expansión). Dado que el personaje es parte de la Familia Bestia y quiere relacionarse con Hestia, podrías considerar incorporar elementos que conecten con el fuego del hogar o la protección, puesto que Hestia es la diosa del hogar y la arquitectura. Por ejemplo: - Hearthweaver (una combinación de \\"hearth\\", que significa hogar o chimenea, y \\"weaver\\", que significa tejedor, podría simbolizar a alguien que teje destinos o caminos en torno al hogar de Hestia). - Ignisoul (combinando \\"ignis\\", que es fuego en latín, y \\"soul\\", alma, sugiriendo una conexión del alma con el fuego protector de la diosa). Recuerda que a la hora de elegir un apellido para tu personaje, además de buscar significado y conexión con el universo de tu ficción, es importante considerar cómo suena y se siente en relación con el nombre Vyomi. ¡Espero que alguno de estos apellidos te inspire para tu historia!"},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and fictional The Last of Us Part II story set on the Seraphite Island about a day in the life of a male Seraphite, who also has a crush on a twink Seraphite, coupling with him at the end of the day. Add dialogue throughout the story","output":"Title: Whispers on Seraphite Isle In the far reaches of the Seraphite archipelago, where the cresting waves caressed the shores of a secluded island, sat a community of devout followers. The island thrived with lush, verdant foliage and an eerie calm that was as beautiful as it was foreboding. Among the people here, there lived a young man, Elior, with a strength and spirit that matched the wild landscapes. As the tangerine hues of dawn painted the sky, Elior rose from his modest straw pallet. The island was alive with the chirrupings of distant birds as he donned his rugged, handwoven tunic specific to his people. “Elior!” A voice called out, carrying across the morning breeze. He knew that voice - it was Micah, a slender Seraphite, with eyes that held the soft sparkle of starlight. Elior felt his heart flutter at the sound. “Good morning, Micah,” Elior greeted, smiling at the sight of him. They were the same age, yet Elior always admired Micah’s poise, his serene aura. “Have the gods blessed your sleep?” “They have, thank you. And yours?” “Filled with dreams,” Elior admitted, truthfully yet cryptically. Dreams of a life where they could be more than just fellow Seraphites, lingering under the cascade of Micah's curls, twinkling like the promise of daybreak. Their morning duties began together. Elior and Micah, alongside the community, recited their morning affirmations with conviction in the Seraphite tongue before tending to the gardens and livestock. The work was hard but rewarding, as their labor kept the island self-sufficient - a pillar of their faith. As the sun reached its zenith, Elior and Micah sat side by side, taking their midday meal composed of simple, earthy fare. All around them, life buzzed with the chatter of the community and the rustle of leaves in the mild breeze. It was during these quiet moments that Elior desperately wished to reveal his heart’s yearning. But words of such affection were best kept hidden, stowed deep beneath layers of dogma and tradition. “Micah, do you ever… think of a life beyond these shores?” Elior whispered beneath the cacophony of surrounding voices, seeking the kinship of shared desire. “I do,” Micah admitted, eyes glistening with a dangerous hope. “But Elior, to speak such thoughts is to entertain heresy.” Elior nodded solemnly. “Our duty is to the path, indeed.” But the sentiment of his words felt hollow, even to him. The chores resumed, shadowing the path of the sun until it bled into the horizon, staining the skies a deep crimson. Tensions grew less with the fading light, and the community gathered for the evening’s reflection. Under the watchful eyes of elders and peers, Elior and Micah’s fingers brushed discreetly. Such small, clandestine touches held the weight of unspoken verses, a secret language born from their silent, yearning gazes. As night drew the island into its dark embrace, Elior and Micah found themselves alone, standing at the water's edge where the beckoning whisper of waves dared them to dream louder. “Elior,” Micah broke the silence, his voice a tender caress that could sway the firmest resolve. “The love I hold cannot be bound by their path. My only truth… is you.” Elior’s heart soared and ached in equal measure. “And mine is reflected in your eyes,” he confessed, stepping closer as the tension of the day melted into the moonlit surf that played at their toes. In a daring embrace, under the watchful gaze of the moon, they found solace in each other. Their lips met, a coupling more potent than any words of prayer or redemption. In that moment, they were simply Elior and Micah - two souls intertwined by a love that transcended doctrine, worshiping at an altar of their own making. As the stars danced overhead, a tapestry of celestial wonder, their quiet murmurs and breathless laughter blended with the nocturnal hymn of the island. Finally surrendering to the touch they longed for, they fell asleep in one another's arms, embraced in the knowledge that, at least for this stolen night, their spirits were truly free."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed The Last of Us Part II story set on the Seraphite Island about a day in the life of a male Seraphite, who also has a crush on a twink Seraphite, coupling with him at the end of the day.

Let's focus instead on a day in the life of a male Seraphite as he navigates his feelings and place within the community. --- The day broke with a blanket of mist clinging to the dense woodland of the Seraphite Island. Birds chirped in the distance, their melodies intertwining with the soft chants that echoed through the tall, sturdy pines. With the first rays of sunlight piercing through the foliage, Silas rose from his modest bedding—a handmade quilt laid over hay. Silas was a young man, and his heart belonged to the teachings of the Seraphite prophet. His days were filled with rigorous discipline, tasks in service of his community, and the ever-present duty to uphold the tenets of their faith. This morning, like every morning, began with prayer. As he ventured out of the wooden shack he called home, the village was already pulsing with activity. Other Seraphites were tending to gardens, their hands deep in the earth, while some stood guard, ever-watchful for outsiders or Wolves who might threaten their peace. Silas made his way to the training grounds, his eyes meeting those of Micah, a fellow Seraphite with a wiry build and eyes that seemed to see right through the veil of everyday life. Micah's presence always stirred something within Silas—a feeling he tried to quell with recitations of scripture. \\"Good morning, Brother Silas,\\" Micah greeted, a friendly grin on his face, the morning light making his skin glow. \\"And to you, Brother Micah,\\" Silas replied, the hint of a blush rising in his cheeks. \\"You are at the training early.\\" Micah hoisted his bow, a crafted masterpiece of yew wood, onto his back and shrugged. \\"The quiet of dawn lends itself well to focus and reflection.\\" \\"You speak truly,\\" Silas admitted, feeling his heart race. \\"After training, I am to tend to the stables. Will I see you at the evening meal?\\" \\"Perhaps,\\" Micah replied, his voice gentle, eyes lingering on Silas for a moment longer than necessary before he turned to join the others in archery practice. Throughout the day, Silas worked diligently. He fed the horses, repaired a section of the fence, and aided in moving supplies. His hands, calloused yet precise, moved with the ease of one who was fully integrated into the lifecycle of his community. As evening approached, he joined the others for their communal meal. Their diet was simple—root vegetables, wild greens, and occasionally fish caught from the surrounding waters. Silas took his place at one of the rough-hewn wooden tables, his gaze unintentionally searching for Micah. He found him seated on the other side of the circle, engaged in animated conversation with the elder Seraphites. Even from this distance, Silas could see the passion and fervor in Micah's gestures as he discussed a point of doctrine. Once the meal concluded, and the sky painted itself in hues of pink and orange as the sun dipped below the horizon, Silas found himself walking along a secluded path, away from the communal fires and the scattered huts. He needed time to think, to sort through his tangled emotions. \\"Deep in thought?\\" a voice whispered from behind him. Surprised, Silas turned to find Micah stepping out of the shadows, the dim light of the few stars visible above casting a gentle glow on his face. \\"You startled me,\\" Silas said, willing his voice to remain steady. \\"I was... reflecting on the teachings.\\" Micah took a step closer, bridging the gap between them. \\"Sometimes, I think we're meant to find our own understanding within the teachings. To seek the quiet whispers of our hearts.\\" Silas's breath caught in his throat as he felt the warmth of Micah's proximity. Silas couldn't help but wonder if perhaps his feelings weren't such a sin but a natural extension of the bond they shared as brothers in faith. Micah reached out, his fingertips brushing against Silas's hand—a touch as tentative as it was electrifying. \\"We carry so many burdens,\\" Micah said softly. \\"But in this moment, let's just be.\\" And under the cover of the approaching night, with the stars as their only witnesses, Silas felt the weight of his burdens ease, if only for a little while, as he accepted the unspoken invitation in Micah's eyes to explore the depth of their connection. The two young men found solace in each other’s company, speaking in hushed tones about their hopes, dreams, and the shared trials of their faith. For Silas, a day that began like any other had transformed into a night that held the promise of understanding and acceptance, as they nestled close, simply enjoying the peace that had settled over them. As they returned to the encampment, the night grew deeper, and so did their bond—a secret kept close to the heart in a world brimming with danger and doctrine. Their path forward uncertain, but for now, they held fast to the tranquility of this single day and the warmth of companionship amidst the tumultuous seas of life."},{"instruction":"Shares from Wikipedia Sudarsky's classification of gas giants for the purpose of predicting their appearance based on their temperature was outlined by David Sudarsky and colleagues in the paper Albedo and Reflection Spectra of Extrasolar Giant Planets[1] and expanded on in Theoretical Spectra and Atmospheres of Extrasolar Giant Planets,[2] published before any successful direct or indirect observation of an extrasolar planet atmosphere was made. It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres. Gas giants are split into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I. The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth and Venus, or ice giants such as Uranus (14 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses). ~Background The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply to few of the extrasolar planets known because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example, the hot Jupiters. Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance HD 189733 b.[3] That planet has further been shown to be blue with an albedo greater (brighter) than 0.14.[4] Most planets so mapped have been large and close-orbiting \\"hot Jupiters\\". Speculation on the appearances of unseen extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely atmosphere of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of insolation. ~Planetary classes Class I: Ammonia clouds Gaseous giants in this class have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a planetary system. They exist at temperatures less than about 150 K (−120 °C; −190 °F). The predicted Bond albedo of a class I planet around a star like the Sun is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for Jupiter[5] and 0.342 for Saturn.[6] The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as tholins or phosphorus, which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations. The temperatures for a class I planet requires either a cool star or a distant orbit. The former may mean the star(s) are too dim to be visible, where the latter may mean the orbits are so large that their effect is too subtle to be detected until several observations of those orbits' complete \\"years\\" (cf. Kepler's third law). The increased mass of superjovians would make them easier to observe, however a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter would have more internal heating, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. Class II: Water clouds Gaseous giants in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F).[2] Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. Class III: Cloudless Gaseous giants with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.[2] (They would not form sulfuric acid clouds like Venus due to excess hydrogen.) These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, CoRoT-9b, HD 205739 b and Pollux b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds.[2] Class IV: Alkali metals Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet.[2] HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.[7][8] HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. Class V: Silicate clouds For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.[9] Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b.[2] HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13b.","output":"Sudarsky's classification system provides a way to predict the appearance of gas giants based on their temperature and atmospheric properties. It divides gas giants into five classes: Class I, with ammonia clouds; Class II, with water clouds; Class III, cloudless; Class IV, with alkali metals dominating the atmosphere; and Class V, with silicate clouds. This classification system is useful in understanding the potential diversity of atmospheres among extrasolar gas giants. By studying the predicted properties of different classes of planets, scientists can make educated guesses about the appearance and composition of these distant worlds. Examples of planets that fall into these classes include 47 Ursae Majoris c and d for Class I, HD 45364 b and c for Class II, HD 37124 b for Class III, 55 Cancri b for Class IV, and 51 Pegasi b for Class V. By studying these planets and their atmospheres, researchers can gain insight into the variety of conditions that may exist on other planets beyond our Solar System."},{"instruction":"Describe coldest and uncanniest rogue gas giant approached inner Solar system, it has Sudarsky class IV.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the new ages every round and to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"Welcome to the Grand Arcanum Arena, Sapphire.

Her increased Impetuousness may now thwart her ability to flawlessly execute mature spells. Lily is now effectively 8 and gaining in magical prowess at an alarming rate. Sapphire, the audience is in awe of your initial display, but there's a growing concern among them as they notice the slight change in your demeanor.

Подставляем числа и получаем: [ E = frac{6.626 times 10^{-34} cdot 3.00 times 10^{8}}{500 times 10^{-9}} = frac{6.626 times 10^{-34} cdot 3.00}{500} cdot 10^{-19} ] [ E = frac{19.878 times 10^{-34}}{500} cdot 10^{-19} ] [ E = 3.9756 times 10^{-34} cdot 10^{-19} ] [ E = 3.9756 times 10^{-53} ] Дж Теперь мы можем найти общую энергию всех фотонов, выпущенных за одну минуту: [ E_{text{общ}} = E cdot N ] где ( N ) - общее количество фотонов за минуту, в нашем случае ( 6 times 10^{20} ). [ E_{text{общ}} = 3.9756 times 10^{-53} cdot 6 times 10^{20} ] [ E_{text{общ}} = 3.9756 times 6 times 10^{-33} ] [ E_{text{общ}} = 23.8536 times 10^{-33} ] [ E_{text{общ}} = 2.38536 times 10^{-32} ] Дж Теперь найдем полную энергию, потребленную лампой за минуту: [ E_{text{потреб}} = P cdot t ] где ( P ) - мощность лампы (( 220 ) Вт) и ( t ) - время в секундах (( 1 ) минута или ( 60 ) секунд). [ E_{text{потреб}} = 220 cdot 60 = 13200 ] Дж И теперь мы можем найти КПД лампы: [ КПД = left(frac{E_{text{общ}}}{E_{text{потреб}}}right) times 100% ] [ КПД = left(frac{2.38536 times 10^{-32}}{13200}right) times 100% ] [ КПД = left(1.807 times 10^{-36}right) times 100% ] КПД будет крайне малым, и если сравнить энергию всех фотонов с энергией, потребляемой лампой, это будет незаметная часть. Скорее всего, в расчетах была допущена ошибка, так как величина ( E_{text{общ}} ) была вычислена неверно и является слишком малой. Пересчитаем значение энергии фотона. Если выразить ( lambda ) в метрах: [ lambda = 500 times 10^{-9} ] м Тогда ( E_{text{фот}} ) для одного фотона: [ E_{text{фот}} = frac{6.626 times 10^{-34} cdot 3.00 times 10^8}{500 times 10^{-9}} ] Упростим выражение: [ E_{text{фот}} = frac{6.626 times 3}{500} times 10^{-34+8+9} ] [ E_{text{фот}} = frac{19.878}{500} times 10^{-17} ] [ E_{text{фот}} approx 0.0398 times 10^{-17} ] [ E_{text{фот}} = 3.98 times 10^{-19} ] Дж Теперь рассчитаем энергию всех фотонов за минуту: [ E_{text{общ}} = 3.98 times 10^{-19} cdot 6 times 10^{20} ] [ E_{text{общ}} = 2.388 times 10^{2} ] Дж Теперь мы можем очень просто найти КПД лампы: [ КПД = frac{E_{text{общ}}}{E_{text{потреб}}} times 100% ] [ КПД = frac{2.388 times 10^{2}}{13200} times 100% ] [ КПД approx frac{2.388}{132} times 100% ] [ КПД approx 0.0181 times 100% ] [ КПД approx 1.81% ] Итак, коэффициент полезного действия лампы составляет приблизительно 1.81%."},{"instruction":"Определи энергию фотона для лучей с длиной волны 2⋅10 ^−7 , если значение постоянной Планка равно 6,6⋅10 ^−34 Дж ⋅с.","output":"Энергия фотона ( E ) может быть найдена с помощью формулы для энергии кванта света (фотона): [ E = frac{h cdot c}{lambda} ] где: - ( h ) — постоянная Планка (( 6.6 times 10^{-34} ) Дж·с), - ( c ) — скорость света в вакууме (примерно ( 3 times 10^8 ) м/с), - ( lambda ) — длина волны света.

It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres. Gas giants are split into five classes (numbered using Roman numerals) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only Jupiter and Saturn are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I. The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example terrestrial planets such as Earth and Venus, or ice giants such as Uranus (14 Earth masses) and Neptune (17 Earth masses). ~Background The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations. In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply to few of the extrasolar planets known because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example, the hot Jupiters. Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance HD 189733 b.[3] That planet has further been shown to be blue with an albedo greater (brighter) than 0.14.[4] Most planets so mapped have been large and close-orbiting \\"hot Jupiters\\". Speculation on the appearances of unseen extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely atmosphere of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of insolation. ~Planetary classes Class I: Ammonia clouds Gaseous giants in this class have appearances dominated by ammonia clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a planetary system. They exist at temperatures less than about 150 K (−120 °C; −190 °F). The predicted Bond albedo of a class I planet around a star like the Sun is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for Jupiter[5] and 0.342 for Saturn.[6] The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as tholins or phosphorus, which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations. The temperatures for a class I planet requires either a cool star or a distant orbit. The former may mean the star(s) are too dim to be visible, where the latter may mean the orbits are so large that their effect is too subtle to be detected until several observations of those orbits' complete \\"years\\" (cf. Kepler's third law). The increased mass of superjovians would make them easier to observe, however a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter would have more internal heating, which could push it to a higher class. As of 2015, 47 Ursae Majoris c and d could be Class I planets. Upsilon Andromedae e and 55 Cancri d may also be Class I planets. Class II: Water clouds Gaseous giants in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of water vapor. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (−23 °C; −10 °F).[2] Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of Earth, the atmosphere would still consist mainly of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich molecules such as methane. Examples of possible class II planets: HD 45364 b and HD 45364 c, HD 28185 b, Gliese 876 b, Upsilon Andromedae d, 55 Cancri f, 47 Ursae Majoris b, PH2b, Kepler-90 h, HD 10180 g. Class III: Cloudless Gaseous giants with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170 °F, 80 °C) and 800 K (980 °F, 530 °C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.[2] (They would not form sulfuric acid clouds like Venus due to excess hydrogen.) These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of Rayleigh scattering and absorption by methane in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of Uranus and Neptune. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of Mercury. Possible class-III planets are HD 37124 b, HD 18742 b, HD 178911 Bb, 55 Cancri c, Upsilon Andromedae c, Kepler-89e, CoRoT-9b, HD 205739 b and Pollux b. Above 700 K (800 °F, 430 °C), sulfides and chlorides might provide cirrus-like clouds.[2] Class IV: Alkali metals Above 900 K (630 °C/1160 °F), carbon monoxide becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than methane). Furthermore, the abundance of alkali metals, such as sodium substantially increase, and spectral lines of sodium and potassium are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's spectrum. These planets form cloud decks of silicates and iron deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as hot Jupiters. 55 Cancri b was listed as a class IV planet.[2] HD 209458 b at 1300 K (1000 °C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool stratosphere. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated \\"TiVO\\"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.[7][8] HD 189733 b, with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930 °C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its \\"hot spot\\"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet. TrES-2b was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV. Class V: Silicate clouds For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100 °F, 1100 °C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the silicate and iron cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.[9] Examples of such planets might include 51 Pegasi b and Upsilon Andromedae b.[2] HAT-P-11b and those other extrasolar gas giants found by the Kepler telescope might be possible class V planets, such as Kepler-7b, HAT-P-7b, or Kepler-13b.","output":"The Sudarsky classification system provides a way to predict the appearance of gas giants based on their temperature and physical properties.

Class IV planets have dominant carbon-carrying molecules like carbon monoxide in their atmospheres and increased abundance of alkali metals like sodium. Class V planets are the hottest gas giants with silicate and iron cloud decks high up in the atmosphere.

Being classified as a Sudarsky class IV planet, Necrothor exhibits certain unique characteristics that set it apart from other gas giants. As a class IV gas giant, Necrothor has temperatures above 900 K, meaning that carbon monoxide is the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in its atmosphere. The planet also has an increased abundance of alkali metals such as sodium, making spectral lines of sodium and potassium prominent in its spectrum. This gives Necrothor a distinct appearance and spectral signature that can be identified by astronomers. Due to its low Bond albedo of 0.03, Necrothor reflects very little light and appears dark in the vastness of space. The planet's atmosphere likely hosts cloud decks of silicates and iron deep within its layers, contributing to its eerie and mysterious appearance. The presence of these unique atmospheric components makes Necrothor a fascinating and enigmatic object to study. Overall, Necrothor's classification as a Sudarsky class IV gas giant, combined with its cold temperatures and rogue status in the inner Solar system, makes it a truly fascinating and uncanny celestial body that defies conventional expectations."},{"instruction":"Necrothor is cold Sudarsky class IV gas giant, Earth scientists believed Necrothor was hot Jupiter ejected from star system","output":"The discovery of Necrothor, a cold Sudarsky class IV gas giant that was believed by Earth scientists to be a hot Jupiter ejected from a star system, has raised intriguing questions and sparked scientific curiosity. The classification of Necrothor as a class IV gas giant indicates its low Bond albedo, dominant carbon-carrying molecules like carbon monoxide in its atmosphere, and increased abundance of alkali metals such as sodium. The theory that Necrothor was once a hot Jupiter that was ejected from its original star system sheds light on its cold temperature and unique characteristics. Hot Jupiters are gas giants that orbit very close to their parent stars, experiencing intense heat and radiation. The possibility that Necrothor was once in such a close orbit and has since been ejected into the depths of space presents an intriguing scenario for scientists to study. The presence of cloud decks of silicates and iron deep within Necrothor's atmosphere further adds to the mystery surrounding this rogue gas giant. Studying Necrothor's composition, temperature, and orbital trajectory can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of gas giants in different environments. Overall, the discovery of Necrothor as a cold, rogue gas giant with a potential origin as a hot Jupiter ejected from a star system highlights the complexity and diversity of planetary systems in our universe. Further research and observation of Necrothor may reveal more about the processes that shape the evolution of gas giants and their interactions within stellar systems."},{"instruction":"Earth scientists extended ancient Sudarsky classification system, chromochemical (color-chemistry) classification of gas giant: 1.

Gil rolled his bulbous eyes. \\"Oh algae, not this again.

Before another word could be spoken, a loud crash echoed through the water, sending ripples far and wide. The fish scattered, hiding behind lily pads and peaking out from the pebbles. The very pond itself seemed to pause, the wind holding its breath, the dragonflies stilling their wings. And then, there he was. The fabled Steve Harrington, in full, unabashed nudity, tiptoeing into the pond with the grace of an elephant on roller skates. His infamous locks of hair even more impressive without the support of '80s mousse and hairbands. \\"Oh, lily pad me,\\" Gil gasped. \\"That's a lot of human.\\" Steve Harrington, evidently seeking solace from his monster-filled life above the surface, settled down with a satisfied sigh. \\"Ah, finally some alone time.

Gil nodded with conviction. \\"To the blowhole!\\" With synchronized finwork, the fish began a frantic water dance, circling around Steve Harrington and his ripples of repulsion. The humans at the pond's edge watched mystified as the pond waters churned with frothy fervor, creating a whirlpool around the unsuspecting nude Harrington. “What the—?” he stammered, suddenly at the center of a fish-induced Jacuzzi. The gas bubbles rose and burst with each flap of a fin, each unspoken mission to rid their watery home from the KFC aftermath. With impeccable timing, the fish then dispersed, their plan complete, leaving the pond’s surface still once more. \\"Looks like we made it,\\" Gil wheezed, as the pond's natural, algae-induced aroma returned. Steve the koi floated by in agreement, his eyes watering slightly. \\"By Poseidon's trident, we did, my foul-smelling friend.

The upside-down world met its match today—not by supernatural means, but by the valiant efforts of its most unsuspected heroes: the fish of Willow Pond. And as the ripples of his departure faded, Steve the koi, Shrimpin, and Gil shared an approving glance. For today, they had not only saved their home but also lived a tale worthy of Stranger Things—albeit much wetter and certainly more scaled. \\"Beware, surface dwellers!\\" Gil shouted to the retreating figure. \\"Willow Pond takes no prisoners!\\" The fish triumphantly swam back into the depths of the pond, their humor undampened, their Legend of the Stinky Harrington just beginning to unfold."},{"instruction":"Schopenhauer'a göre insanlık tarihin en büyük 3 sanat eseri?","output":"Arthur Schopenhauer, 19. yüzyılın önemli Alman filozoflarından biridir ve estetik üzerine pek çok görüş beyan etmiştir.

Schopenhauer'a göre sanat, fenomenler dünyasının ötesine, yani \\"şeylerin kendisi\\" olan anlamına ulaşmanın bir yoluydu. Ancak Schopenhauer'ın insanlık tarihinin en büyük üç sanat eserini belirlediği ve bunları açıkça sıraladığı spesifik bir ifadeyle karşılaşmak zor. Schopenhauer sanatın farklı türlerini tartışmış ve özellikle Batı sanatına aşina olmuş biri olarak bazı eserleri yüksek değerlerde anmıştır. Müziğe olan derin ilgisinden dolayı Johann Sebastian Bach'ın müziğini övmüştür ve genellikle müziği diğer tüm sanat formlarının üstünde tutmuştur. Schopenhauer'in sanatı yorumlama biçimi ve değer vermesi, her sanatçının ve sanat eserinin varlığını salt bireysel tercihler ve kültürel bağlam içerisinde anlamaya çalışmakla ilgilidir. Bu yüzden Schopenhauer'ın genel olarak sanat hakkındaki görüşleri bilinse de, insanlık tarihinin en büyük üç sanat eserine ilişkin somut ve katı betimlemeler yapmış olduğunu söylemek zordur. Filozofun eserlerini inceleyerek onun sanat ve estetik anlayışına dair daha net fikirler edinilebilir, fakat bu tür bir sıralamanın doğrudan onun kaleminden çıktığını belli eden bir kaynağa ulaşmak pek mümkün değildir.
