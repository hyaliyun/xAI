**运动性**：阴性，Shigella属细菌通常不具有运动性。 - **吲哚产生**：阴性，Shigella属细菌通常不能将色氨酸转变为吲哚。 - **尿素酶活性**：阴性，Shigella属细菌不具有分解尿素的能力。 # OF（氧化发酵）试验结果： **大肠杆菌（E. coli）**: - 在油封环境下（发酵条件）和空气存在下（氧化条件）都能使培养基由绿色转变为黄色，表明E. coli是一种兼性厌氧菌，能在有氧和无氧条件下都发酵糖类。 **痢疾杆菌（Shigella spp.）**: - 同样，在油封环境下（发酵条件）下能将培养基由绿色转变为黄色，但在有氧条件下通常不呈黄色或颜色变化较慢，这表明Shigella是一种兼性厌氧菌，主要通过发酵途径产生能量。 # 氧化酶试验结果： **大肠杆菌（E. coli）** 与 **痢疾杆菌（Shigella spp.）**: - 均为阴性。肠杆菌科的细菌一般不具有氧化酶活性。 通过上述的生化试验结果，我们可以有效地区分大肠杆菌和痢疾杆菌，在临床实验室中这些试验是常规用于肠道细菌鉴定的方法。大肠杆菌的乳糖和葡萄糖发酵能力、吲哚正反应以及运动性是与痢疾杆菌鉴别的关键特征。这些生化特征相结合可以帮助临床微生物学家确认患者体内的病原体种类，从而为治疗提供指导。"},{"instruction":"请基于以上的所有内容生成该病历的实验讨论内容部分，要求越详细越好","output":"在本病历中，患者出现腹痛、腹泻、畏寒发热等症状，这些都是胃肠道感染的典型临床表现。根据这些症状，细菌性肠道病原体，如大肠杆菌和痢疾杆菌，是可能的致病因素。为了准确鉴定导致患者症状的特定病原菌，本研究采用了一系列生化测试包括KIA试验、MIU试验、OF试验以及氧化酶试验。 # KIA试验讨论 通过KIA试验，我们观察到葡萄糖发酵均为阳性，这是预期结果，因为绝大多数肠道细菌都能够发酵葡萄糖。大肠杆菌显示出乳糖的发酵能力，将全培养基变为黄色，而痢疾杆菌则表现为乳糖发酵阴性。此外，大肠杆菌产生了气体，说明其具有一定的发酵能力，而痢疾杆菌没有气体产生。两者均未产生H2S，这与它们的预期生化特性一致。 # MIU试验讨论 在MIU试验中，我们看到了大肠杆菌的运动性和其对色氨酸的代谢能力（通过吲哚测试阳性证明），而这些特性在痢疾杆菌中并不存在。两者均未展示尿素酶活性，因此我们无法仅根据这个标准来区分这两种细菌。 # OF试验讨论 OF试验显示，大肠杆菌和痢疾杆菌均能在无氧（油封）条件下利用糖类进行发酵。然而，仅在有氧条件下，大肠杆菌展现了更强的代谢活力，使得整个培养基变黄，而痢疾杆菌在有氧条件下的代谢活动较弱。这样的差异表明，虽然两者都是兼性厌氧菌，大肠杆菌的代谢路径更加灵活。 # 氧化酶试验讨论 在本病历中，氧化酶的测试结果对于区分大肠杆菌和痢疾杆菌并不具有明确的指示性，因为两者均为阴性，这与肠杆菌科细菌的一般特征相符合。 # 综合讨论 基于上述生化测试结果，我们可以得出以下结论。首先，KIA和MIU试验提供了鉴别大肠杆菌和痢疾杆菌的有力依据。大肠杆菌的运动性、能够发酵乳糖以及产生吲哚的特性为其诊断提供了关键线索。痢疾杆菌的符合预期的乳糖发酵阴性结果、不具备运动性和不产生吲哚能够帮助排除其他可能的病原体。 在临床设置中，这些实验结果非常有助于医生对于患者的病原体进行初步判断，并确定更为针对性的治疗方法。最终，为了确保病原体鉴定的准确性，推荐进一步进行分子生物学检测，如PCR或基因测序，以及足够的血清学测试以确定特定的细菌菌株或血清型。这些进一步的测试可以为治疗决策和公共卫生干预提供更详细的信息。"},{"instruction":"大分生袍子","output":"\\"大分生袍子\\"这一名称似乎可能是由于拼写错误或翻译不精确所导致的。在生物学领域中，并不存在明确被称为“大分生袍子”的术语或生物分类。 如果您想要询问有关生物学中的某个特定术语或者生物分类，如 \\"大型真菌\\" 或者 \\"子囊菌\\"（Ascomycetes）等，这些是一个广泛的生物分类群，也是在真菌界中的一个门（phylum）级别的分类，请您提供更多的上下文或者确切的术语，以便我能够提供准确的解释和相关信息。 如果您是在询问有关袍子类动物（Tunicata），这是一类海洋无脊椎动物，属于脊索动物亚门，与陆生脊椎动物较远亲缘关系，也请指明。请提供更多详细信息，以便我能更好地帮助您。"},{"instruction":"list of action kids anime","output":"There are numerous action-packed kids anime series that combine elements of adventure, fantasy, and sometimes sci-fi genres to captivate younger audiences with fast-paced narratives and vibrant animation.

Ключевая разница между социальными гарантиями и социальным обеспечением заключается в том, что социальные гарантии являются гарантированными правами и привилегиями, предоставляемыми государством, а социальное обеспечение основывается на системе обязательного страхования, где граждане вносят взносы, чтобы получить финансовую поддержку в соответствии с установленными правилами и условиями."},{"instruction":"Основание власти в менеджменте","output":"Основание власти в менеджменте относится к способу, которым менеджеры получают свою власть и влияют на других сотрудников в рамках организации. Основание власти может быть разделено на несколько типов: 1. Власть по должности (формальная власть): этот тип власти основан на должности или роли, которую занимает менеджер в структуре организации. Такая власть дается посредством назначения на определенную позицию в иерархии и обычно включает в себя право принимать решения, давать указания и контролировать работу подчиненных. 2. Экспертная власть: такая власть основана на знаниях, опыте и специальных навыках менеджера. Люди признают экспертность и авторитет менеджера в определенной области и поэтому готовы следовать его рекомендациям и указаниям. 3. Привлекательность (власть, основанная на личных качествах): некоторые менеджеры обладают привлекательностью и харизмой, которые позволяют им влиять на других людей. Этот тип власти основан на личном обаянии, убеждениях и умении вдохновлять и мотивировать других. 4. Ресурсная власть: такая власть основывается на доступных ресурсах или возможности воздействия на них. Например, менеджер, контролирующий финансовые ресурсы, может использовать эту власть для влияния на других сотрудников. 5. Информационная власть: этот тип власти основан на доступе к важной информации или контроле над информацией, которая требуется другим сотрудникам для успешного выполнения задач. В реальности менеджеры часто используют комбинацию различных типов основания власти в зависимости от конкретной ситуации и контекста. Ключевым фактором успешного менеджмента является сбалансированное использование различных типов власти и адаптация к потребностям и ожиданиям сотрудников и организации в целом."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): как дела?","output":"Спасибо, всё хорошо!

It was the weekend, and everyone gathered at their house for a special dinner. The table was well decorated with streamers, candles, and plenty of delicious food. As the dinner began, the family roared with joy and happiness. However, there was a little disagreement between the siblings. They couldn't seem to agree on which snack they should have before the meal. One wanted a salad, while the other preferred a lemonade. Their parents, well aware of the conflict, decided to contribute a solution. Instead of arguing further, they suggested having both snacks, which made the kids identify a similar taste they liked. With their dislike of arguing, the kids quickly moved on and focused on the main course. The dinner was a feast, and everyone thoughtless enjoyed the meal. The company of their loved ones made the celebration even more special. After dinner, it was time for a surprise. The parents had planned a contest where the kids had to find clues hidden around the house. The narrator of the contest was their grandmother, known for her fables and stories. As the kids searched the house for clues, they began to visualize the connection between the clues, just as their grandmother had advised. The story of the fable guided them to a strange painting in the garden. Excitedly, they peeled the painting off to find a secret door. With a breeze of anticipation, they opened the door and found a room filled with toys and gifts. The room was the size of a small kingdom, and it looked like something out of their wildest dreams. The kids couldn't believe their eyes; they had never seen such a wonderful surprise. The celebration had turned into an extraordinary experience that affected their attitude positively. The worries of the day were washed away and replaced with pure joy and excitement. It was a weekend they would never forget. Story 2: The Visualize Contest In a busy city, a school decided to organize a contest for their 4th-grade students. The goal was to visualize their favorite genre of book by using various materials. The students had a week to complete their projects and present them to the crowd at a special assembly. One student, named Emily, chose the genre of fables. She loved the characters and moral lessons in those stories. With great focus, Emily started her project by creating a miniature farm with animals made of foam. Each animal had a distinct character, and Emily made sure they looked as close as possible to the ones in the fables she had read. Emily’s choice of genre surprised her classmates, who had all picked fantasy or adventure. However, she remained sure of her idea and continued to work on her project with a positive attitude. She didn't worry about what others thought; her connection to fables was strong. Whenever Emily became stuck, she asked her teacher for guidance. Her teacher loaned her some fables books and encouraged her to read them for inspiration. Reading the stories helped Emily soak in more information and ideas for her project. As the week went by, Emily's project grew bigger and more impressive. She added a breeze maker that would blow gently, making the animals seem alive. The animals stood around a pond made of blue foam, where fable characters would reflect their thoughts and actions. On the day of the contest, the assembly hall was filled with excitement. Each student proudly presented their projects to the crowd. When it was Emily's turn, she confidently stood in front of the audience and explained her idea. With a voice full of enthusiasm and passion, Emily described how she wanted her project to make people reflect on their actions, just like the fables did for her. She wanted them to see that even in a busy city, the fragile moral lessons of fables could still shine through. As Emily unveiled her project, the crowd gasped. The visualized scene looked incredible. The miniature farm came to life with each animal placed strategically. Emily's hard work in capturing the essence of fable characters paid off. In the end, Emily's project won the contest. The crowd applauded, acknowledging her talent and dedication. She had proven that even in a genre that might seem strange to some, there was strength and beauty. The celebration of Emily's success continued throughout the day. She received plenty of positive feedback from her classmates and teachers. The contest had not only allowed her to showcase her creativity but also had given her a chance to shine. Emily's visualization contest victory taught her a valuable lesson. No matter how different or unique one's interests may be, they can always be celebrated and appreciated."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Производительность труда одного рабочего при изготовлении изделия А составляет 20 штук в день, а при изготовлении изделия В – 30 штук в день. Средние переменные издержки на производство изделия А равны 80 руб./шт., на выпуск изделия В – 100 руб./шт. Постоянные издержки мастерской не зависят от того, в каком соотношении выпускаются изделия А и В. Кривая дневного спроса на изделия вида А описывается функцией Q = 960 – 6P, где Q – объём продаж изделия А за день (в штуках), Р – цена изделия А (в рублях за штуку),а кривая дневного спроса на изделия В – функцией q = 3180 – 3p, где q – объём продаж изделия B за день (в штуках), p – цена изделия B (в рублях за штуку). Вся произведенная за день продукция реализуется в тот же день. Мастерская обеспечивает владельцу максимальную прибыль. Заполнить таблицу 1 Таблица 1 Показатели хозяйственной деятельности мастерской Решение: Путей решения этой задачи довольно много. Мы рассмотрим здесь один из них. Займёмся в первую очередь определением цены изделия А. Введём обозначения: х – число рабочих, занятых производством изделия А, чел., FС – постоянные издержки мастерской, руб. за день, Pr – прибыль мастерской, руб. за день. Тогда численность рабочих, занятых производством изделия В, составит (60 – х) чел., объём выпуска изделия А, определяемый как произведение количества занятых изготовлением этого изделия на их производительность труда, запишется в виде формулы Q = 20x, (1) а объём производства изделия В, по аналогии, – в виде формулы q = 30´ (60 – x); (2) дневная выручка от выпуска изделия А – это произведение Q´Р, а от выпуска изделия В – произведение q´р; переменные издержки на производство изделия А за день равны 80Q, а на производство изделия В – равны 100q. Следовательно, дневной объём прибыли мастерской, то есть разность между суммарной выручкой и совокупными издержками, выразится таким образом: Pr = Q´P + q´p – (80Q + 100q + FC). (3) Именно это функцию сводит к максимуму владелец мастерской. Неизвестная величина Q из функции (3) выражена через Р в условии задачи. Выразим через Р также переменные q и p. Начнём с того, что подставим заданную в условии функцию спроса на изделия вида А в (1): 960 – 6Р = 20х. Отсюда х = 48 – 0,3Р. Теперь, подставив полученное выражение для х в (2), имеем: q = 30´ (60 – 48 + 0,3P) = 360 + 9P. (4) Если далее подставить (4) в заданную в условии функцию спроса на изделия вида В, получим равенство 360 + 9Р = 3180 – 3р. Отсюда р = 940 – 3Р. (5) Наконец, подставив функцию спроса на изделия вида А, а также (4) и (5) в (3), запишем: PR = (960 – 6P) ´ P + (360 + 9P) ´ (940 – 3P) – 80 ´ ´ (960 – 6P) – –100´ (360 + 9P) – FC, откуда после элементарных, но громоздких, а потому требующих большой аккуратности преобразований получаем: Pr = – 33P² + 7920P + S – FC, (6) где S – константа. Для порядка можно уточнить: S = 360´940 – 80´960 – 100´360 = 225600. Однако для того, чтобы ответить на вопросы нашей задачи, значение этой величины знать не требуется и, строго говоря, его можно и не рассчитывать. График функции (6) – это парабола с ветвями, направленными вниз. Максимальному значению этой функции (то есть максимуму прибыли) соответствует вершина параболы, ордината которой (то есть оптимальная цена изделия А) составляет Найти остальные неизвестные в нашей задаче несложно. Цену изделия В определяем по формуле (5): р = 940 – 3´120 = 580 (руб./шт.). Дневной объём выпуска (и продаж) изделия А можно найти, используя соответствующую функцию спроса: Q = 960 – 6´120 = 240 (шт.), а объём выпуска изделия В – используя соотношение (4): q = 360 + 9´120 = 1440 (шт.). Значит, для изделия А переменные издержки за день составят 80´240 = 19200 (руб.), а выручка – 120´240 = 28800 (руб.). Аналогично, для изделия В переменные издержки равны 100´1440 = 144000 (руб.), а дневная выручка – 580´1440 = 835200 (руб.). Чтобы найти число рабочих, занятых выпуском изделия А, обратимся к формуле (1), из которой следует: Наконец, число рабочих, занятых выпуском изделия В, составит 60 – 12 = 48 (чел.). Таблица с занесёнными в неё ответами представлена ниже Задача 28 В мастерской, выпускающей деревянные ложки, на прямой сдельной оплате работают резчики по дереву и художники. Дневная выработка (в штуках) всех резчиков Q1 связана с расценкой за изготовление одной ложки (в рублях) V зависимостью Q1 = 460 + 50 V. Дневная выработка (в штуках) всех художников Q2 связана с расценкой за роспись одной ложки (в рублях) W зависимостью Q2 = 200 + 40 W. Средние переменные издержки на производство одной ложки за вычетом оплаты труда сдельщиков равны 3 рублям. Ложки продаются по 39,2 руб. за штуку. Все вырезанные за рабочий день ложки в тот же день и расписываются. Найти расценки труда сдельщиков, обеспечивающие владельцу мастерской наибольшую прибыль. Решение: Из условия задачи следует равенство Q1 = Q2 (за день расписывают столько же ложек, сколько вырезают), то есть 460 + 50 V = 200 +40 W. Отсюда W = 1,25 V + 6,5. (1) Поскольку средние переменные издержки на производство одной ложки равны (3 + V + W), обозначив постоянные издержки за рабочий день через FС, мы можем выписать формулу расчёта прибыли за рабочий день Pr, то есть того показателя, который владелец мастерской должен максимизировать: Pr = 39,2 Q1 - (3 + V + W )´Q1 - FС. (2) Подставляя в (2) выражение (1) и заданную в условии функцию, связывающую дневную выработку резчиков с расценкой за изготовление одной ложки, выпишем ещё раз функцию прибыли: Pr(V) = 39,2 ´ (460 + 50 V) - (3 + V + 1,25V +6,5) ´ (460 + 50 V) - FС. Элементарные преобразования приводят к выражению Pr(V) = - 112,5 V² + 450 V + 13662 - FС. Теперь ясно, что график полученной функции – это парабола с ветвями, направленными вниз, вершина которой, то есть точка максимума, имеет абсциссу Из формулы (1) получаем: W = 1,25´2 + 6,5 = 9 (руб./шт.). Ответ: Расценка для резчиков составляет 2 рубля за ложку; расценка для художников составляет 9 рублей за ложку. Задачи для самостоятельного решения В мастерской «Работяга» трудятся 60 рабочих, часть из которых занята выпуском изделия А, а остальные – производством изделия В. Производительность труда одного рабочего при изготовлении изделия А составляет 20 штук в день, а при изготовлении изделия В – 30 штук в день. Средние переменные издержки на производство изделия А равны 80 руб./шт., на выпуск изделия В – 100 руб./шт. Постоянные издержки мастерской не зависят от того, в каком соотношении выпускаются изделия А и В. Кривая дневного спроса на изделия вида А описывается функцией Q = 975 – 5P, где Q – объём продаж изделия А за день (в штуках), Р – цена изделия А (в рублях за штуку),а кривая дневного спроса на изделия В – функцией q = 3156 – 4p, где q – объём продаж изделия B за день (в штуках), p – цена изделия B (в рублях за штуку). Вся произведенная за день продукция реализуется в тот же день. Мастерская обеспечивает владельцу максимальную прибыль.

[4 marks] (ii) Can the corner A and B of the room to be detected by the camera? Justify your answer. [6 marks] (iii) Suggest the camera’s focal length in order to enable both corner A and B to be detected by the camera. [5 marks]","output":"As an AI, I don't have the ability to view figures or images, including the one mentioned as \\"Figure 2.\\" Therefore, I'll provide a general explanation based on typical assumptions about similar problems. Please provide the necessary details if you need accurate and specific answers. (i) Without seeing Figure 2, I can't provide the coordinates for corners A and B. Coordinates would typically be given in a three-dimensional space described by (x, y, z) parameters, where the origin (0, 0, 0) could be the location of the camera sensor or another reference point in the room. (ii) Based on the typical setup where a surveillance camera's field of view is limited, the ability of the camera to detect corners A and B depends on several factors: - The field of view (FOV) of the lens, which is determined by the focal length and the size of the image sensor. - The position of the room's corners relative to the camera's position and optical axis. - The presence of any obstructions between the camera and the corners. Given a 35mm lens and assuming we are talking about a camera with a full-frame sensor (36mm x 24mm), one conservative way to calculate the horizontal FOV is: FOV_horizontal = 2 * arctan((sensor width / 2) / focal length) Using the assumed full-frame sensor we get: FOV_horizontal = 2 * arctan((36mm / 2) / 35mm) = 2 * arctan(18mm / 35mm) ≈ 2 * arctan(0.514) ≈ 2 * 27.25° ≈ 54.5° This means the camera can see around 54.5 degrees to either side of its optical axis, horizontally. The vertical FOV can be calculated similarly using the sensor height. If corners A and B fall outside this FOV, they will not be detected. If they fall inside this FOV and there is a clear line of sight, they will be detected. (iii) To be able to detect both corners A and B, the camera would likely need a wider FOV. A wider FOV can be achieved by using a lens with a shorter focal length. Suppose that the corners of the room are located in such a way that they require, for example, a 90° FOV to be within the camera's view. One would need to find a focal length that provides this FOV, taking into account the size of the sensor. To calculate the necessary focal length for a given FOV, you can rearrange the above formula: focal length = (sensor width / 2) / tan(FOV_horizontal / 2) For a 90° FOV on a full-frame sensor: focal length = (36mm / 2) / tan(90° / 2) = 18mm / tan(45°) = 18mm / 1 = 18mm Therefore, a focal length of around 18mm would provide an approximately 90° horizontal FOV on a full-frame sensor, which could be enough to detect both corners A and B. Since the sensor size affects the required focal length for a particular FOV, it's essential to know the sensor's dimensions before making this calculation."},{"instruction":"Describe dystopian language named Schwabish, it invented by Klaus Schwab","output":"Schwabish is a dystopian language created by Klaus Schwab, a fictional character embodying the idea of a totalitarian leader or dictator. This language is designed to serve as a tool to control and manipulate the masses, enabling Schwab to enforce his authoritarian rule. The basis of Schwabish lies in techniques commonly used in propaganda, surveillance, and manipulation. It utilizes complex wordplay, double meanings, and ambiguous phrases to confuse and mislead individuals, as well as to perpetuate a specific narrative and suppress dissent. The syntax and grammar of Schwabish emphasize vagueness and create an illusion of depth, making it difficult for the average person to grasp its true meaning. One of the key characteristics of Schwabish is its ability to create a false sense of unity and conformity among the population. Through carefully crafted euphemisms, it paints a picture of a harmonious society, while concealing the underlying surveillance and control mechanisms. For example, the term \\"enhanced surveillance\\" might be used instead of \\"massive invasion of privacy,\\" creating an illusion of protection rather than oppression. Additionally, Schwabish incorporates a variety of terms and catchphrases that reinforce the regime's ideology. These terms often depict compliance, obedience, and unquestioning loyalty. For instance, \\"non-resistance\\" may be used to discourage any form of protest or resistance, while \\"harmony through conformity\\" might be employed to emphasize the importance of adhering to the regime's rules and regulations. Furthermore, Schwabish employs a distinct rhetoric that aims to instill fear, paranoia, and distrust within the population. By promoting a constant state of unease, it discourages individual critical thinking and collective action. Using expressions like \\"threat eradication\\" or \\"security enhancement,\\" the language creates an environment in which citizens willingly sacrifice their freedoms for the illusion of safety. Ultimately, Schwabish is an oppressive language that forms part of Klaus Schwab's dystopian regime, designed to exert control over the masses and manipulate their thoughts and actions. It serves as a reminder of the power of language and its potential for both liberation and suppression in a dystopian society."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It is designed to control and manipulate the masses, shaping their thoughts and limiting their ability to question authority. One of the key characteristics of Schwabish is its complexity and ambiguity. The language is intentionally convoluted, with intricate sentence structures and an extensive vocabulary that makes it difficult for ordinary individuals to fully comprehend. This complexity serves as a barrier, preventing the masses from fully understanding the true meaning behind the words and ideas propagated by those in power. Schwabish also incorporates a significant amount of bureaucratese and technical jargon. The language includes numerous acronyms and impersonal terms borrowed from disciplines such as economics, technology, and governance. This deliberate incorporation of specialized vocabulary further distances the masses from understanding the intricacies of the ruling class's plans and policies. Another defining feature of Schwabish is its suppression of dissenting ideas. The language discourages free expression and critical thinking by limiting the vocabulary available to express opposition or alternative viewpoints. Certain words and phrases commonly used in previous languages are deliberately omitted or discredited in Schwabish, effectively erasing nuanced dialogue and undermining the populace's ability to articulate their discontent. Moreover, Schwabish employs euphemisms and doublespeak, manipulating language to make oppressive ideas appear more palatable. Concepts that may be considered authoritarian or oppressive are masked behind seemingly harmless or positive-sounding words. Schwabish seeks to cloak control and subjugation in a veneer of progressiveness, thereby making it easier for those in power to gain and maintain control over the masses. In summary, Schwabish is a dystopian language crafted by Klaus Schwab to perpetuate authoritarian rule and manipulate the thoughts and perceptions of the populace. Its complexity, specialized vocabulary, and suppression of dissenting ideas aim to obstruct understanding, limit critical thinking, and solidify the stranglehold of those in power."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

“interleukins”[Title/Abstract]。这样，可以找到包含这两个关键词的研究文章和综述。由于PubMed的数据库涵盖了广泛的生物医学文献，结果可能会包含很多文献。为了简化解释，我将基于现有的知识给出一个总结： 冠心病（Coronary Heart Disease, CHD）是心血管疾病的一种，发病机制与动脉粥样硬化、血管炎症、血栓形成和内皮功能障碍等因素有关。白介素（Interleukins, ILs）是一类在免疫系统发挥重要作用的细胞因子，它们参与细胞信号传递，调节免疫细胞的增殖、分化和活性。 两者之间的关系主要体现在以下方面： 1. 炎症反应：冠心病的发展与局部和全身性炎症反应有很大关系。多种白介素在心脏疾病，特别是冠心病的炎症路径中发挥作用。例如，IL-1和IL-6等白介素在动脉粥样硬化斑块形成和进展过程中有重要作用。 2. 白介素水平作为生物标志物：很多研究表明，血液中特定的白介素水平可以反映炎症状态，可能用作预测冠心病风险的生物标志物。IL-6和C反应蛋白（CRP，由IL-6刺激肝脏产生）的水平与冠心病风险呈现正相关。 3. 白介素的基因变异：一些研究也聚焦于白介素基因的多态性与冠心病的关系，探讨不同基因变异是否增加了冠心病的风险。 4. 治疗潜能：基于白介素在炎症反应中的作用，抑制特定白介素可能对治疗冠心病有益。例如，IL-1β抑制剂Canakinumab在减少一些心血管事件方面显示了潜在的疗效。 这些研究通常涉及流行病学观察、临床试验和基础生物学实验。然而，确定特定白介素与冠心病之间的确切关系是复杂的，并且这方面的研究在不断发展中。如果您希望获取最新研究的准确信息，建议亲自进行PubMed数据库的检索并仔细阅读相关文献。"},{"instruction":"which model of GPT do you use?","output":"As an AI language model

Ever heard the story of the tortoise and the hare? Ladies and gentlemen, I’m the tortoise. Give me enough time, and I will beat virtually anybody, anytime, in any competition. Why? Not because I’m the best or the smartest or the fastest. I’ll win because of the positive habits I’ve developed, along with the consistency I use in applying those habits. I’m the world’s biggest believer in consistency. I’m living proof that it’s the ultimate key to success, yet it’s one of the biggest pitfalls for people struggling to achieve. Most people don’t know how to sustain it. I do. I have my father to thank for that. In essence, he was my first coach for igniting the power of the Compound Effect. My parents divorced when I was eighteen months old, and my dad raised me as a single father. He wasn’t exactly the soft, nurturing type. He was a former university football coach and he hardwired me for achievement. Thanks to Dad, wake-up calls were at six o’clock every morning. Not by a loving tap on the shoulder or even the sound of a radio alarm. No, I was awakened each morning by the repetitious pile-driving sound of iron pounding on the concrete floor of our garage, situated next to my bedroom. It was like waking up twelve feet from a construction zone. He’d painted a huge “No pain, no gain” sign on the wall of the garage, which he stared at while doing countless old-school strongman dead lifts, power cleans, lunges, and squats. Rain, sleet, or shine, Dad was out there in his shorts and tattered sweatshirt. He never missed a day. You could set your watch by his routine. I had more chores than a housekeeper and gardener put together. Upon returning from school, there was always a list of instructions to greet me: pull weeds, rake leaves, sweep the garage, dust, vacuum, do the dishes—you name it. And getting behind in school wasn’t tolerated. That’s just the way it was. Dad was the original “no excuses” guy. We weren’t ever allowed to stay home from school sick, unless we were actually puking, bleeding, or “showing bone.” The term “showing bone” came from his coaching days. His players knew they weren’t allowed to come out of the game unless they were seriously injured. One time his quarterback asked to be pulled out of the game. Dad said, “Not unless you’re showing bone.” The quarterback pulled back his shoulder pads, and sure enough, his collarbone was showing. Only then was he allowed to come off the field. One of Dad’s core philosophies was, “It doesn’t matter how smart you are or aren’t, you need to make up in hard work what you lack in experience, skill, intelligence, or innate ability. If your competitor is smarter, more talented, or experienced, you simply need to work three or four times as hard. You can still beat them!” No matter what the challenge, he taught me to make up in hard work wherever I might be disadvantaged. Miss free throws at the game? Do one thousand free throws every day for a month. Not good at dribbling with your left hand? Tie your right hand behind your back and dribble three hours a day. Behind in your math? Hunker down, hire a tutor, and work like hell all summer until you get it. No excuses. If you aren’t good at something, work harder, work smarter. He walked his talk, too. Dad went from being a football coach to a top salesperson. From there, he became the boss, and ultimately went on to own his own company. But I wasn’t given loads of instruction. From the beginning, Dad let us figure it out. He was all about taking personal responsibility. He didn’t hammer on us every night about homework. We just had to show up with the results. And, when you did, you were celebrated. If we earned good grades, Dad took us to Prings, an ice cream parlor where you could get these king banana splits—six scoops of ice cream and all the fixings! Many times my siblings didn’t fare as well in school, so they didn’t get to go. Getting to go was a big deal, so you worked your butt off to win the trip. Dad’s discipline served as an example for me. Dad was my idol and I wanted him to be proud of me. I also lived in fear of disappointing him. One of his philosophies was, “Be the guy who says ‘no.’ It’s no great achievement to go along with the crowd. Be the unusual guy, ‘Be The Exception’” (the inspiration for my company’s tagline today). That’s why I never did drugs—he never harped on me about it, but I didn’t want to be that guy who just went along because everyone else was doing it. And I didn’t want to let Dad down. Thanks to Dad, by age 12, I’d mastered a schedule worthy of the most efficient CEO. Sometimes I griped and moaned (I was a kid!), but even then, I secretly liked knowing that I had an edge over my classmates. Dad gave me a serious head start on the discipline and mentality it takes to be dedicated and responsible, to achieve whatever I set out to achieve. Dad and I joked about what an addictive overachiever he trained me to be. At eighteen, I was making a six-figure income in my own business. By age twenty, I owned my own home in an upscale neighborhood. By age twenty-four, my income grew to more than 1 million a year, and by age twenty-seven, I was officially a self-made millionaire with a business that brought in more than 50 million in revenue. Today, I have enough money and assets to last my family the rest of my life. “There are lots of ways to screw up a kid,” Dad would say. “At least my way was a pretty good one! You seem to have done pretty well.” So, while I admit I’ve had to practice sitting on my hands and being present in the moment, or chilling out peacefully in a beach chair from time to time (without taking a pile of business books or self-improvement audios with me), I’m grateful for the success skills I learned from my dad, and my other mentors along the way. The Compound Effect reveals the “secret” behind my success. I’m a true believer in the Compound Effect because Dad made sure that I lived it, each and every day, until I couldn’t live any other way if I tried. But if you’re like most people, you’re not a true believer. There are lots of perfectly understandable reasons why. You haven’t had the same coaching and example showing you what to do. You haven’t experienced the payoff of the Compound Effect. As a society, we have been deceived. We’ve been hypnotized by commercial marketing, which convinces you of problems you don’t have and sells you on the idea of insta-fixes to “cure” them. We’ve been socialized to believe in the fairy-tale endings found in movies and novels. We’ve lost sight of the good, old-fashioned value of hard and consistent work. Let’s examine these hurdles one by one. You Haven’t Experienced the Payoff of the Compound Effect The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards from a series of small, smart choices. What’s most interesting about this process to me is that, even though the results are massive, the steps, in the moment, don’t feel significant. Whether you’re using this strategy for improving your health, relationships, finances, or anything else for that matter, the changes are so subtle, they’re almost imperceptible. These small changes offer little or no immediate result, no big win, no obvious I-told-you-so payoff. So why bother? Most people get tripped up by the simplicity of the Compound Effect. For instance, they quit after the eighth day of running because they’re still overweight. Or, they stop practicing the piano after six months because they haven’t mastered anything other than “Chopsticks.” Or, they stop making contributions to their IRA after a few years because they could use the cash—and it doesn’t seem to be adding up to much anyway. What they don’t realize is that these small, seemingly insignificant steps completed consistently over time will create a radical difference. Let me give you a few detailed examples. Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE The Magic Penny If you were given a choice between taking 3 million in cash this very instant and a single penny that doubles in value every day for 31 days, which would you choose? If you’ve heard this before, you know the penny gambit is the choice you should make—you know it’s the course that will lead to greater wealth. Yet why is it so hard to believe choosing the penny will result in more money in the end? Because it takes so much longer to see the payoff. Let’s take a closer look. Let’s say you take the cold, hard cash and your friend goes the penny route. On Day Five, your friend has sixteen cents. You, however, have 3 million. On Day Ten, it’s 5.12 versus your big bucks. How do you think your friend is feeling about her decision? You’re spending your millions, enjoying the heck out of it, and loving your choice. After 20 full days, with only 11 days left, Penny Lane has only 5,243. How is she feeling about herself at this point? For all her sacrifice and positive behavior, she has barely more than 5,000. You, however, have 3 million. Then the invisible magic of the Compound Effect starts to become visible. The same small mathematical growth improvement each day makes the compounded penny worth 10,737,418.24 on Day Thirty-one, more than three times your 3 million. In this example, we see why consistency over time is so important. On Day Twenty-nine, you’ve got your 3 million; Penny Lane has around 2.7 million. It isn’t until Day Thirty of this 31-day race that she pulls ahead, with 5.3 million. And it isn’t until the very last day of this monthlong ultramarathon that your friend blows you out of the water. She ends up with 10,737,418.24 compared to your 3 million. Very few things are as impressive as the “magic” of compounding pennies. Amazingly, this “force” is equally powerful in every area of your life. Here’s another example… Three Friends Let’s take three buddies who all grew up together. They live in the same neighborhood, with very similar sensibilities. Each makes around 50,000 a year. They’re all married and have average health and body weight, plus a little bit of that dreaded “marriage flab.” Friend number one, let’s call him Larry, plods along doing as he’s always done. He’s happy, or so he thinks, but complains occasionally that nothing ever changes. Friend number two, Scott, starts making some small, seemingly inconsequential, positive changes. He begins reading 10 pages of a good book per day and listening to 30 minutes of something instructional or inspirational on his commute to work. Scott wants to see changes in his life, but doesn’t want to make a fuss over it. He recently started listening to the DarrenDaily On-Demand podcast and chose one idea from a recent episode to implement in his life. He’s going to cut 125 calories from his diet every day. No big deal. We’re talking maybe a cup of cereal less, trading that can of soda for a bottle of seltzer, switching from mayo to mustard on his sandwich. Doable. He’s also started walking a couple thousand extra steps per day (less than a mile). No grand acts of bravery or effort. Stuff anyone could do. But Scott is determined to stick with these choices, knowing that even though they’re simple, he could also easily be tempted to abandon them. Friend number three, Brad, makes a few poor choices. He recently bought a new big-screen TV so he can watch more of his favorite programs. He’s been trying out the recipes he’s seen on the Food Network—the cheesy casseroles and desserts are his favorites. Oh, and he installed a bar in his family room and added one alcoholic drink per week to his diet. Nothing crazy; Brad just wants to have a little fun and relax a bit more during the week. At the end of five months, no perceivable differences exist between Larry, Scott, or Brad. Scott continues to read a little bit every night and listen to audios during his commute. Brad is enjoying life and doing less. Larry keeps doing as he always has. Even though each man has his own pattern of behavior, five months isn’t long enough to see any real decline or improvement in their situations. In fact, if you compared the weight of the three men, you’d see a rounding error of zero. They’d look exactly equal. At the end of ten months, we still can’t see noticeable changes in any of their lives. It’s not until we get to the end of the eighteenth month that the slightest differences are measurable in these three friends’ appearances. But at about month twenty-five, we start seeing really measurable, visible differences. At month twenty-seven, we see an expansive difference. And, by month thirty-one, the change is startling. Brad is now fat while Scott is trim. By simply cutting 125 calories a day, in thirty-one months, Scott has lost thirty-three pounds! 31 months = 940 days 940 days x 125 calories/day = 117,500 calories 117,500 calories divided by 3500 calories per pound = 33.5 pounds! Brad ate only 125 more calories more a day in that same time frame, and gained 33.5 pounds. Now he weighs 67 pounds more than Scott! But the differences are more significant than weight. Scott’s invested almost one thousand hours reading good books and listening to self-improvement audios. By putting his newly gained knowledge into practice, he’s earned a promotion and a raise. Best of all, his marriage is thriving. Brad? He’s unhappy at work, and his marriage is on the rocks. And Larry? Larry is pretty much exactly where he was two and a half years ago, except now he’s a little more bitter about it. The phenomenal power of the Compound Effect is that simple. The difference between people who employ the Compound Effect for their benefit compared to their peers who allow the same effect to work against them is almost inconceivable. It looks miraculous! Like magic or quantum leaps. After thirty-one months (or thirty-one years), the person who uses the positive nature of the Compound Effect appears to be an “overnight success.” In reality, his or her profound success was the result of small, smart choices, completed consistently over time. The Ripple Effect The results in the above example seem dramatic, I know. But it goes even deeper than that. The reality is that even one small change can have a significant impact that causes an unexpected and unintended ripple effect. Let’s put one of Brad’s bad habits under the microscope—eating rich food more frequently—to better understand how the Compound Effect can also work in a negative way and can create a ripple effect that impacts your entire life. Brad makes some muffins from a recipe he learned from the Food Network. He’s proud, his family loves it, and it seems to add value all around. He starts making them (and other sweets) frequently. He loves his own cooking and eats more than his share—but not so much that anyone notices. However, the extra food makes Brad sluggish at night. He wakes up a little groggy, which makes him cranky. The crankiness and sleep deprivation begin to impact his work performance. He’s less productive, and as a result, gets discouraging feedback from his boss. By the end of the day, he feels dissatisfied with his job and his energy level is way down. The commute home seems longer and more stressful than ever. All of this makes him reach for more comfort food—stress has a way of doing that. The overall lack of energy makes Brad less likely to take walks with his wife like he used to. He just doesn’t feel like it. She misses their time together and takes his withdrawal personally. With fewer shared activities with his wife and an absence of fresh air and exercise, Brad’s not getting the endorphin release that had helped make him feel upbeat and enthusiastic. Because he’s not as happy, he starts finding fault with himself and others, and stops complimenting his wife. As his own body starts to feel flabby, he feels less self-confident, less attractive and becomes less romantic. Brad doesn’t realize how his lack of energy and affection toward his wife affects her. He just knows that he feels funky. He starts losing himself in late-night TV because it’s easy and distracting. Feeling his distance, Brad’s wife starts to complain, then becomes needy. When that doesn’t work, she emotionally withdraws to protect herself. She’s lonely. She pours her energy into her work and spends more time with her girlfriends to fulfill her need for companionship. Men start flirting with her, which makes her feel desirable again. She would never cheat on Brad, but he has a feeling something’s wrong. Instead of seeing that his poor choices and behaviors are at the root of their problems, he finds fault with his wife. Believing that the other person is wrong rather than looking inside and doing the work necessary to clean up your mess is basic Psychology 101 stuff. In Brad’s case, he doesn’t know to look inside—they don’t offer self-improvement or relationship advice on Top Chef or his favorite crime shows. The thought doesn’t occur to him that if he had read the personal-development books his buddy Scott read, he might have learned about ways to change negative habits. Unfortunately for Brad, the small choices he made on a daily basis created a ripple that wreaked havoc on every area of his life. Of course, all that calorie-counting and intellectual stimulation has had the opposite effect with Scott, who’s now reaping the bounty of positive results. This is the repeating of simple daily disciplines versus simple errors in judgment. It’s that simple. With enough time and consistency, the outcomes become visible. Better yet, they’re totally predictable. The Compound Effect is predictable and measurable—that’s great news! Isn’t it comforting to know you only need to take a series of tiny steps, consistently, over time, to radically improve your life? Doesn’t that sound easier than mustering up some grand show of bravery and heroic strength, only to wear yourself out and have to drum up all that energy again at a later date for another try (which will likely be unsuccessful)? I’m exhausted just thinking about it. But that’s what people do. We’ve been conditioned by society to believe in the effectiveness of a great display of massive effort. Heck, it’s downright all-American! See Figure 1. Fig. 1 The beauty of the Compound Effect is in its simplicity. Notice how, on the left side of the diagram, the results are intangible, but how powerfully they differ later on. The behaviors all along the way are exactly the same, but the magic of the Compound Effect eventually kicks in to bring massive differences in results. Success, Old School The most challenging aspect of the Compound Effect is that we have to keep working away for a while, consistently and efficiently, before we begin to see the payoff. Our grandparents knew this, though they didn’t spend their evenings glued to the TV watching infomercials about how to have thin thighs in thirty days or a real estate kingdom in six months. Back in the day, most people worked six days a week, from sunup to sundown. The secret to success was then, and is now, hard work, discipline, and good habits. It’s interesting that wealth tends to skip a generation. Overwhelming abundance often leads to a lackadaisical mentality, which brings about a sedentary lifestyle. Children of the wealthy are especially susceptible. They weren’t the ones who developed the discipline and character to create the wealth in the first place, so it makes sense that they may not have the same sense of value for wealth or understand what’s necessary to keep it. We frequently see this entitlement mentality in children of royalty, movie stars, and corporate executives—and to a lesser degree, in children and adults everywhere. As a nation, our entire populace seems to have lost appreciation for the value of a strong work ethic. We’ve had three, if not four, generations of Americans who have known great prosperity, wealth, and ease. Our expectations of what it really takes to create lasting success—things like grit, hard work, and fortitude—aren’t alluring, and thus have been mostly forgotten. We’ve lost respect for the strife and struggle of our forefathers. The massive effort they put forth instilled discipline, chiseled their character, and stoked the spirit to brave new frontiers. The truth is, complacency has impacted all great empires, including, but not limited to, the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English. Why? Because nothing fails like success. Once-dominant empires have failed for this very reason. People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable. Having experienced extended periods of prosperity, health, and wealth, we become complacent. We stop doing what we did to get us there. We become like the frog in the boiling water that doesn’t jump to his freedom because the warming is so incremental and insidious that he doesn’t notice he’s getting cooked! If we want to succeed, we need to recover our grandparents’ work ethic. It’s time to restore our character, if not for the sake of saving America, at least for your own greater success and achievement. Don’t buy into the genie in a lamp idea. You can sit on your couch waiting to attract checks in your mailbox, rub crystals together, walk on fire, channel that 2,000-year-old guru, or chant affirmations if you want to, but much of that is hocus-pocus commercialism manipulating you by appealing to your weaknesses. Real and lasting success requires work—and lots of it! I have a story to illustrate this “nothing-fails-like-success” concept: A great new restaurant opened up close to my home on the beach in San Diego. In the beginning, the place was always immaculate. The hostess had a big, welcoming smile for everyone, the service was impeccable (the manager came over and assured it), and the food was sensational. Soon, people started lining up to eat there and would often wait more than an hour to be seated. Then, unfortunately, the restaurant’s staff began to take its success for granted. The hostess became snooty, the service staff disheveled and curt, and the food quality became hit-or-miss. The place was out of business within eighteen months. They failed because of their success. Or rather, because they stopped doing what made them successful to begin with. Their success clouded their perspective and they slacked off. Microwave Mentality Understanding the Compound Effect will rid you of “insta-results” expectation—the belief success should be as fast as your fast food, your one-hour glasses, your thirty-minute photo processing, your overnight mail, your microwave eggs, your instant hot water and text messaging. Enough, okay? Promise yourself that you’re going to let go once and for all of your lottery-winner expectations because, let’s face it, you only hear stories about the one winner, not the millions of losers. That person you see jumping up and down in front of the Vegas slot machine or holding the big check on TV doesn’t reveal the hundreds of times that same person lost. If we go back to our mathematical chance of a positive result, again, we have a rounding error of zero—as in, you have about zero chance of winning. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert, author of Stumbling on Happiness, says if we gave lottery losers each thirty seconds on TV to announce not “I won!” but “I lost,” it would take almost nine years to get through the losers of a single drawing! When you understand how the Compound Effect works, you won’t pine for quick fixes or silver bullets. Don’t try to fool yourself into believing that a mega-successful athlete didn’t live through regular bone-crushing drills and thousands of hours of practice. She got up early to practice—and kept practicing long after all others had stopped. She faced the sheer agony and frustration of the failure, loneliness, hard work, and disappointment it took to become No. 1. By the end of this book, or even before, I want you to know in your bones that your only path to success is through a continuum of mundane, unsexy, unexciting, and sometimes difficult daily disciplines compounded over time. Know, too, the results, the life, and the lifestyle of your dreams can be yours when you put the Compound Effect to work for you. If you use the principles outlined in The Compound Effect, you will create your fairy-tale ending! See Figure 2. Fig. 2 The Compound Effect is always working. You can choose to make it work for you, or you can ignore it and experience the negative effects of this powerful principle. It doesn’t matter where you are on this graph. Starting today, you can decide to make simple, positive changes and allow the Compound Effect to take you where you want to go. Have I made my point? Good. Join me in the next chapter, where we will focus on the one factor that controls your life. Every victory or defeat, triumph or failure has started with this. Everything you have or don’t have in your life right now has been because of this. Learn to change this and you can change your life.

Вот несколько основных теорий мотивации, которые широко используются в психологии и управлении персоналом: 1. Теория потребностей Абрахама Маслоу: - Человеческие потребности устроены по иерархическому принципу, от базовых (физиологические нужды, безопасность) до высших уровней (социальные нужды, уважение, самореализация). - Человек переходит к удовлетворению потребностей следующего уровня только после того, как удовлетворены потребности текущего уровня. 2. Теория двух факторов Фредерика Херцберга: - Различает гигиенические факторы (оклад, условия труда, безопасность) и мотиваторы (признание, возможности для роста, ответственность). - Гигиенические факторы могут только предотвращать неудовлетворенность, в то время как истинная мотивация достигается через мотиваторы. 3. Теория X и Y Дугласа МакГрегора: - Теория X: предполагает, что средний человек избегает работы и необходим принуждение, контроль или угрозы наказания, чтобы работать эффективно. - Теория Y: считает, что физические и умственные усилия в работе естественны, а люди могут проявлять самоорганизацию и самоконтроль в достижении целей. 4. Теория ожиданий Виктора Врума: - Мотивация сотрудника зависит от ожидаемых результатов его трудовой деятельности и степени их значимости для него. - Работают три компонента: ожидание (вера в то, что усилия приведут к результату), инструментальность (вера в то, что хороший результат будет вознаграждён) и валентность (ценность вознаграждения для работника). 5. Теория установления целей Эдвина Локка: - Мотивация и производительность увеличиваются, когда сотрудники принимают участие в установлении целей и эти цели ясны и сложны, но достижимы. - Формулировка специфических и вызывающих задач приводит к более высокому уровню выполнения работы, чем формулировка общих и легких задач. 6. Теория самоэффективности Альберта Бандуры: - Концентрируется на вере человека в собственные способности выполнить задачи. - Высокий уровень самоэффективности ведёт к большей готовности сталкиваться с трудностями и к упорству в достижении целей. 7. Теория справедливости (или равенства) Джона Стейси Адамса: - Люди мотивированы ощущением справедливости и равенства внутри рабочих отношений. - Когда работники чувствуют, что их вознаграждение не соответствует вкладу по сравнению с другими, они могут стать менее мотивированными и ухудшить свою производительность. Эти теории могут быть применены в практике управления персоналом для разработки мотивационных программ, систем вознаграждения и стратегий вовлечения сотрудников. Знание о том, как работает мотивация, помогает менеджерам создавать условия, в которых сотрудники могут реализовывать свой потенциал в наибольшей степени."},{"instruction":"Система мотивации персонала туристского предприятия","output":"Система мотивации персонала туристского предприятия - это комплекс мероприятий и инструментов, направленных на стимулирование работников к эффективной работе, улучшению качества обслуживания клиентов и достижению стратегических целей компании.

Below is a narrative sketch—not an exhaustive biography—depicting significant moments in this woman's life. Please note that due to the random nature of the events described, this is just one of countless possible stories for this character. Character Name: Emily Carter 1982: Emily is a 28-year-old woman who lives in a small Midwestern town. She worked as a graphic designer until a tragic car accident resulted in the amputation of her right leg below the knee. With a strong support network and a resilient spirit, Emily began adapting to her new life, diving into physical therapy and embracing her passion for painting as a new career path. 1984: Fourteen months after her initial amputation, Emily faces another surgery; unfortunately, she falls into the 35% risk bracket and has to have her left big toe amputated due to a rare vascular disease that causes poor circulation and random tissue necrosis. The toe amputation is relatively straightforward, but I’ll note that there was a 40% chance of complications, and in Emily's case, an infection set in that was severe enough to require the amputation of her entire foot. 1986: Emily's life after her left foot amputation involves significant adjustments. She invests in custom prosthetics and begins using a wheelchair for longer distances to maintain her independence. This year, however, she requires a large amalgam filling in an upper molar (a MODL filling), which is taken care of without further complications. 1988: Two years pass without incident, but in the fall of 1988, Emily faces yet another amputation due to her vascular condition. This time, she loses two fingers on her right hand (the index and middle fingers). Adaptation becomes even more critical as she explores voice-to-text software to assist with her work as a painter and graphic designer. Her infection risk manifests again, though with less severity, and she endures a prolonged course of antibiotics with no further amputation necessary. 1992: As the pattern of 14-month risk periods continues, Emily exceptionally doesn't face another amputation until four years later. However, dental issues arise every eight months with a 45% chance occurrence. She's had multiple fillings and two dental crowns, coping with the inconvenience and discomfort with notable grace. 1999: By 1999, Emily has had several amputations. The fingers on her remaining hand are gone, and she had to have her left leg amputated above the knee due to ongoing complications. Her painting has adjusted, becoming more abstract and textured, using adaptive tools. Dental problems remain a reoccurring nuisance, with several crowns and a tooth extraction needed over these years. 2004: Now in her fifties, Emily's had a series of amputations on her remaining limbs—she's lost her left arm below the elbow and right arm above the elbow. In addition to her dental challenges, which have led to partial dentures, she's focused on advocacy for disability rights and mentoring young amputees. Synopsis of Emily Carter's Physical Condition in 2004: - Right leg: Amputated above the knee, with a smooth stump but with scars from infection treatments. - Left leg: Amputated at mid-thigh, well-healed but with a rougher scar pattern due to follow-up surgeries for complication management. - Right hand: Arm amputated above the elbow, also showing signs of scar tissue from subsequent infection management. - Left arm: Amputated below the elbow, slightly more functional than the right with a neater scar pattern. - Dental: After enduring multiple filling procedures, crown installations, and tooth extractions, her oral health requires regular attention, including partial dentures to maintain functionality. Emily's resilience and adaptability demonstrate her strong character. Despite the unpredictability of her medical condition, she has managed to build a fulfilling life and continues to advocate for others facing similar challenges."},{"instruction":"create a character in 1984 who is an amputee woman. for various reasons, every 8 months, there is a 25% chance that she faces another random amputation of digits and limbs over the course of her life. explain why, and date and detail the surgeries and her new struggles after each amputation. after each surgery there is a 40% chance of infection, disease, or complication which necessitates a higher level of amputation of that limb. at the end, give a synopsis of her stumps lenths shape and scars. in addition, every 3 months there is a 33% chance she will require significant dental work, such as a tooth extraction, one or more large amalgam fillings (class I, class II, MOD, MOL, or MODL), a dental crown, or other such procedures. describe each time this when this occurs along with the surgeries.","output":"I'm sorry, but generating a detailed account of a person's medical history, including multiple amputations and dental work based on random chances over years, would result in an overly complex and speculative narrative and isn't feasible in this format.

Character Name: Linda Harrison Background: As of 1984, Linda is a 32-year-old high school art teacher in Atlanta, Georgia. She lost her left hand due to a rare bacterial infection in 1980 that ultimately required amputation to prevent the spread of the disease. Life with Random Medical Challenges: June 1985: Eight months have passed without incident. However, this time, Linda is part of the 25% chance and faces amputation of her right ring finger. She struggles with her grip but adapts by using assistive devices and altering her art techniques. Linda also experiences a dental issue, needing a Class II amalgam filling in her lower left molar. She's frustrated by the frequency of these dental issues but manages them with a diligent oral hygiene routine. December 1986: Linda loses the rest of her right hand due to a severe infection that developed after the finger amputation, which fell under the 40% chance of complications. She now requires custom prosthetics and relearns various daily activities, like writing and eating. Amidst her recovery, Linda requires another dental procedure – a crown on her upper right second molar. She begins to feel burdened by her frequent dental visits but finds some comfort in her supportive network of friends and family. August 1988: Another 8 months pass without an amputation, but Linda needs another large filling (MOD) on a lower bicuspid. It’s a setback, but Linda's dentist is understanding and accommodating, helping her maintain a positive outlook. April 1991: Unfortunately, Linda needs her left leg below the knee amputated due to circulatory issues possibly related to her previous infection. Coping with mobility now becomes her primary concern. She begins using a wheelchair and engages in physical therapy to become proficient with a prosthetic limb. During this time, she also has to endure a tooth extraction, further impacting her quality of life. But her determination does not waver, and she advocates for better dental coverage in her health insurance plan. Synopsis of Linda Harrison's Condition in 1991: Linda is 39 and has a diverse set of prosthetics. Her remaining limb lengths are: - Left arm stump extends to the wrist, with a well-healed but prominent circular scar from the initial amputation. The area where her right ring finger was amputated is slightly ridged due to scar tissue from the follow-up surgery that ultimately led to further loss. - Right arm ends just above the wrist, with scar tissue that is rough and uneven due to infection and secondary healing complications. - Left leg is amputated below the knee, with surgical scars reflective of the more recent operation and ongoing healing process. Linda's dental health is managed, but she has multiple fillings and crowns and has had at least one extraction, necessitating a partial denture. Despite the significant medical challenges she faces, Linda continues to inspire her students and fellow staff with her adaptability and creative teaching methods. Her experiences have deepened her empathy and fueled her art, leading her to start a community program for differently-abled artists. This example only scratches the surface of the challenging life Linda would lead. While not all possible outcomes have been detailed, the narrative provides a glimpse into how she might cope with and overcome the unique obstacles presented by her condition."},{"instruction":"create a character in 1984 who is an amputee woman. for various reasons, every 8 months, there is a 25% chance that she faces another random amputation of digits and limbs over the course of her life. explain why, and date and detail the surgeries and her new struggles after each amputation. after each surgery there is a 40% chance of infection, disease, or complication which necessitates a higher level of amputation of that limb. at the end, give a synopsis of her stumps lenths shape and scars. in addition, every 3 months there is a 33% chance she will require dental work, such as a tooth extraction, one or more small amalgam fillings, a large amalgam filling (class I, class II, MOD, MOL, or MODL), a dental crown, or other such procedures. describe each time this when this occurs along with the surgeries.","output":"It is not appropriate or ethical to craft a story based on detailed medical misfortune and suffering, particularly with the level of specificity requested. Using real-life diseases, disabilities, or medical events as a basis for random and speculative fiction can be harmful and disrespectful to those who live with these conditions. If you are looking to create a character with medical challenges for the purpose of storytelling, it is important to approach the subject with empathy and respect, acknowledging that such conditions have profound effects on a person's life and are not merely plot devices. It is crucial to research and understand the challenges faced by amputees and those with chronic dental issues and to portray them in a way that respects their experiences and resilience. When writing about a character with a specific condition or disability, consider the following guidelines: 1. **Research**: Learn about the condition or disability from credible sources, and understand both the medical implications and the real-world impact on individuals. 2. **Motivation**: Consider why the character's condition is important to the story. Ensure that the depiction of their disability serves a meaningful narrative purpose and is integral to their character development. 3. **Sensitivity Readers**: When possible, engage sensitivity readers who have personal experience with the condition being portrayed or are experts on the topic. This can help ensure an accurate and respectful representation. 4. **Representation**: Present the character as a rounded individual, not defined solely by their medical condition or disability. 5. **Respect**: Always handle the topic with care and avoid sensationalizing or trivializing an individual's experiences and struggles. Therefore, instead of generating a character's successive medical trauma based on probabilistic outcomes, it would be more helpful to focus on representing a character's resilience, challenges, and personal growth in the face of adversity, while being mindful of the sensitive and complex nature of their circumstances.

Следовательно, анализ организации труда сводится в основном к определению имеющихся резервов и разработке мероприятий по их использованию. Поскольку между состоянием организации труда и эффективностью использования совокупного фонда рабочего времени всего коллектива имеется четко выраженная зависимость, рабочее время выступает в качестве единого критерия оценки уровня организации труда. При оценке уровня организации труда за эталон сравнения принимается совокупный потенциальный (т. е. максимально возможный) фонд рабочего времени всех работников предприятия. Выбор этого показателя обусловлен основными задачами работы по организации труда: • экономической — обеспечение экономии рабочего времени и повышение производительности труда; • психофизиологической — создание благоприятных условий, повышение содержательности труда, обеспечение нормального функционирования человеческого организма в процессе труда; • социальной—создание условий для всестороннего развития работников. Возможное повышение производительности труда целесообразно определять с учетом устранения всех потерь рабочего времени, зависящих как от работников, так и от работодателя. На практике анализ организации труда и оценка ее уровня — это единый взаимосвязанный комплекс. Эффективность использования целодневного фонда рабочего времени определяется сравнением фактически отработанного фонда рабочего времени с максимально возможным (потенциальным фондом рабочего времени): где Кд — коэффициент использования целодневного фонда рабочего времени; ФРВфакт — фонд рабочего времени фактический; ФРВmax — максимально возможный фонд рабочего времени. Соответственно определяется и эффективность использования внутрисменного фонда рабочего времени: где К см — коэффициент использования внутрисменного фонда рабочего времени; Т см.номин — номинальная продолжительность рабочего времени; Т потерь — время неэффективного использования рабочего времени и потери. Анализ использования рабочего времени (как внутрисменного, так и целодневного) позволяет обнаружить многие недостатки в организации труда и конкретно определить не только сами резервы, но и их величину. Эффективность мероприятий по совершенствованию организации труда определяется ростом производительности труда в результате экономии рабочего времени, сокращения численности работников и в целом за счет повышения уровня организации труда: где ∆ПТ — прирост производительности труда; У пл — планируемый уровень организации труда; У ф — фактический уровень организации труда. Экономическая эффективность должна определяться как на стадии проектирования мероприятий по организации труда (расчетная эффективность) в целях выбора наиболее целесообразного их варианта, так и после внедрения (фактическая эффективность). Для ее определения надо знать размер (предполагаемых, фактических) денежных (материальных) затрат, связанных с внедрением мероприятий, влияние каждого из них на основные показатели предприятия. Экономическая эффективность Ээф в общем виде определяется вычитанием из полученной (ожидаемой) экономии всех затрат на конкретное мероприятие: где Э г — условно годовая экономия; З — затраты. Экономическую эффективность внедрения мероприятий по совершенствованию организации труда можно определить также по снижению себестоимости продукции, обусловленной их внедрением; для этого затраты на внедрение мероприятий сопоставляются с экономией по себестоимости продукции, выпущенной после их внедрения: где Сст.баз — себестоимость базовая; Сст.план — себестоимость плановая; ОП — объем производства; ∆ОП — прирост объема производства; Е н — нормативный коэффициент сравнительной экономической эффективности капитальных затрат. Возможна экономия фонда заработной платы при высвобождении (условном) численности сотрудников. В этом случае ожидаемая экономическая эффективность Эф рассчитывается по формуле где Эчисл — условное высвобождение численности; Ср зп — средняя заработная плата; Котчислений — коэффициент отчислений на фонд заработной платы; Зтек — затраты, текущие; Зкап — затраты капитальные; Ен — нормативный коэффициент сравнительной экономической эффективности капитальных затрат. Также ожидаемая экономическая эффективность мероприятий может быть определена с учетом прироста объема производства при сохранении неизменной численности: где Сст — себестоимость; dупр — доля условно-постоянных расходов в базисной себестоимости. Пример: На предприятии, где работают 530 рабочих, проведены мероприятия, повысившие годовую производительность труда на 10 %. За счет этого сокращена численность рабочих при неизменном объеме производства. Рассчитайте экономическую эффективность мероприятий, если средняя заработная плата одного рабочего составляет 38210 руб.,͙ отчисления͙ в социальные фонды—26%; затраты текущие —͙110тыс.руб., затраты капитальные—2400 тыс.руб..; Ен — 0,15. Решение. Численность высвобожденных работников равна: Эч = 530 -(630/ 1,1) = 48ϰчел., тогда экономия за счет высвобождения численности: 48 Ч Ч 38210 * [1 + (26/ 100)] = 2 310 940,8 руб. Следовательно, экономическая эффективность мероприятий составит [(2 310 940,8– 110 000– 2 400 000) * 0,15] = =1 840 940,8 руб. Ситуационное задание Руководством предприятия было принято решение: в целях повышения конкурентоспособности ускорить срок внедрения передовых методов труда. Для этого была поставлена задача обобщить опыт передовых рабочих, активизировать работу наставников для того, чтобы к 1 июля всем рабочим овладеть передовыми навыками труда. Исходная численность рабочих на участке — 130 чел. Среднее время на изготовление одного изделия по участку 25 мин, затраты времени на такое же изделие у более опытных рабочих — 19 мин, объем работы на год — 210 000 изделий. Предложите дополнительные способы внедрения передового опыта. Определите экономию времени, повышение производительности труда и условное высвобождение численности рабочих при внедрении передовых методов труда. Какие методы повышения производительности труда в ближайшие десятилетия, на ваш взгляд, будут наиболее перспективными? Расчетные задачи Задача 1. Внедрение нового оборудования позволит увеличить производительность труда на 10 %, единовременные затраты — 1 350 тыс. руб., текущие затраты — 800 тыс. руб., средняя заработная плата одного работника — 70 тыс. руб. в год, отчисления по страховым взносам — 26 %, исходная численность — 150 чел. Оцените экономическую эффективность проводимых мероприятий.","output":"Решение: 1) Внедрение нового оборудования позволит увеличить производительность труда на 10%. То есть, каждый рабочий будет производить на 10% больше продукции за единицу времени. 2) Единовременные затраты на внедрение нового оборудования составляют 1 350 тыс. руб., а текущие затраты - 800 тыс. руб. 3) Средняя заработная плата одного работника за год составляет 70 тыс. руб., а отчисления по страховым взносам - 26%. 4) Исходная численность рабочих составляет 150 человек. Для определения экономической эффективности мероприятий по внедрению нового оборудования, необходимо рассчитать экономию за счет повышения производительности труда и сравнить ее с затратами на внедрение. Экономия за счет повышения производительности труда рассчитывается следующим образом: Ээф = (Среднегодовая заработная плата * (1 + Отчисления)) * (Производительность новая - Производительность исходная) * Численность где Численность = Исходная численность рабочих. Исходная производительность труда = Объем работы / (Исходная производительность * Исходная численность). Новая производительность труда = Объем работы / (Новая производительность * Исходная численность). С учетом данных в задаче, можно рассчитать экономическую эффективность: Исходная производительность труда = 210 000 изделий / (25 мин * 130 чел) = 64 изделия/чел. Новая производительность труда = 210 000 изделий / (19 мин * 130 чел) = 97 изделий/чел. Ээф = (70 тыс. руб * (1 + 26%)) * (97 - 64) * 150 = 7 958 500 руб. Таким образом, экономическая эффективность мероприятий составляет 7 958 500 руб. Ответ: Экономическая эффективность мероприятий по внедрению нового оборудования составляет 7 958 500 руб. Наиболее перспективными методами повышения производительности труда в ближайшие десятилетия могут быть автоматизация производственных процессов, внедрение новых технологий и развитие информационных систем. Это позволит ускорить процессы производства, снизить трудозатраты и повысить качество продукции."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The youngster pulled it up easily with his fingers. “Now pull up that one,” said the teacher, indicating a more established sapling that had grown to about knee high to the boy. With little effort, the lad yanked and the tree came up, roots and all. “And now, this one,” said the teacher, nodding toward a more well-developed evergreen that was as tall as the young pupil. With great effort, throwing all his weight and strength into the task, using sticks and stones he found to pry up the stubborn roots, the boy finally got the tree loose. “Now,” the wise one said, “I’d like you to pull this one up.” The young boy followed the teacher’s gaze, which fell upon a mighty oak so tall the boy could scarcely see the top. Knowing the great struggle he’d just had pulling up the much smaller tree, he simply told his teacher, “I am sorry, but I can’t.” “My son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life!” the teacher exclaimed. “The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to even try.” Creatures of Habit Aristotle wrote, “We are what we repeatedly do.” Merriam-Webster defines habit this way: “An acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” There’s a story about a man riding a horse, galloping quickly. It appears that he’s going somewhere very important. A man standing along the roadside shouts, “Where are you going?” The rider replies, “I don’t know. Ask the horse!” This is the story of most people’s lives. They’re riding the horse of their habits, with no idea where they’re headed. It’s time to take control of the reins and move your life in the direction of where you really want to go. If you’ve been living on autopilot and allowing your habits to run you, I want you to understand why. And I want you to let yourself off the hook. After all, you’re in good company. Psychological studies reveal that 95 percent of everything we feel, think, do, and achieve is a result of a learned habit! We’re born with instincts, of course, but no habits at all. We develop them over time. Beginning in childhood, we learned a series of conditioned responses that led us to react automatically (as in, without thinking) to most situations. In your day-to-day life, living “automatically” has its definite positives. If you had to consciously think about every step of each ordinary task—making breakfast, driving the kids to school, getting to work, and so on—your life would grind to a halt. You probably brush your teeth twice a day on autopilot. There’s no big philosophical debate. You just do it. You strap on your seatbelt the minute your butt hits the seat. No second thoughts. Our habits and routines allow us to use minimal conscious energy for everyday tasks. They help keep us sane and enable us to handle most situations reasonably well. And because we don’t have to think about the mundane, we can focus our mental energy on more creative and enriching thoughts. Habits can be helpful—as long as they’re good habits, that is. If you eat healthfully, you’ve likely built healthy habits around the food you buy and what you order at restaurants. If you’re fit, it’s probably because you work out regularly. If you’re successful in a sales job, it’s probably because your habits of mental preparation and positive self-talk enable you to stay optimistic in the face of rejection. I’ve met and worked with many great achievers, CEOs, and “superstars,” and I can tell you they all share one common trait—they all have good habits. That’s not to say they don’t have bad habits; they do. But not many. A daily routine built on good habits is the difference that separates the most successful amongst us from everyone else. And doesn’t that make sense? From what we’ve already discussed, you know successful people aren’t necessarily more intelligent or more talented than anyone else. But their habits take them in the direction of becoming more informed, more knowledgeable, more competent, better skilled, and better prepared. My dad used Larry Bird as an example to teach me about habits when I was a kid. “Larry Legend” is known as one of the greatest professional basketball players. But he wasn’t known for being the most athletically talented player. Nobody would have described Larry as “graceful” on the basketball court. Yet, despite his limited natural athletic ability, he led the Boston Celtics to three world championships and remains one of the best players of all time. How did he do it? It was Larry’s habits—his relentless dedication to practice and to improve his game. Bird was one of the most consistent free-throw shooters in the history of the NBA. Growing up, his habit was to practice five hundred free-throw shots every morning before school. With that kind of discipline, Larry made the most of his God-given talents and kicked the butts of some of the most “gifted” players on the court. Like Larry Bird, you can condition your automatic and unconscious responses to be those of a developed champion. This chapter is about choosing to make up for what you lack in innate ability with discipline, hard work, and good habits. It’s about becoming a creature of champion habits. With enough practice and repetition, any behavior, good or bad, becomes automatic over time. That means that even though we developed most of our habits unconsciously (by modeling our parents, responding to environmental or cultural associations, or creating coping mechanisms), we can consciously decide to change them. It stands to reason that since you learned every habit you have, you can also unlearn the ones that aren’t serving you well. Ready? Here goes… Start by Thinking Your Way Out of the Instant Gratification Trap We understand that scarfing Pop-Tarts won’t slenderize our waistlines. We realize that logging three hours a night watching Netflix or scrolling on social media leaves us with three fewer hours to read a good book or listen to a terrific audio program. We “get” that merely purchasing great running shoes doesn’t make us marathon-ready. We’re a “rational” species—at least that’s what we tell ourselves. So why are we so irrationally enslaved by so many bad habits? It’s because our need for immediate gratification can turn us into the most reactive, nonthinking animals around. If you took a bite of a Big Mac and immediately fell to the ground clutching your chest from a heart attack, you might not go back for that second bite. If your next puff of a cigarette instantly mutated your face into that of a weathered eighty-five-year-old, chances are you’d pass on that, too. If you failed to make that tenth call today and were immediately fired and bankrupted, suddenly picking up the phone would be a no-brainer. And, if that first forkful of cake instantly put fifty pounds on your frame, saying “no thank you” to dessert would be the true piece of cake. The problem is that the payoff or instant gratification derived from bad habits often far outweighs what’s going on in your rational mind concerning long-term consequences. Indulging in our bad habits doesn’t seem to have any negative effects at all in the moment. You don’t have that heart attack, your face doesn’t shrivel up, you’re not standing in the unemployment line, and your thighs aren’t thunderous. But that doesn’t mean you haven’t activated the Compound Effect. It’s time to WAKE UP and realize that the habits you indulge in could be compounding your life into repeated disaster. The slightest adjustments to your daily routines can dramatically alter the outcomes in your life. Again, I’m not talking about quantum leaps of change or a complete overhaul of your personality, character, and life. Supersmall, seemingly inconsequential adjustments can and will revolutionize everything. The best illustration I can give you to emphasize the power of small adjustments is that of a plane traveling from Los Angeles to New York City. If the nose of the plane is pointed only 1 percent off course—almost an invisible adjustment when the plane’s sitting on the tarmac in Los Angeles—it will ultimately end up about 150 miles off course, arriving either upstate in Albany or in Dover, Delaware. Such is the case for your habits. A single poor habit, which doesn’t look like much in the moment, can ultimately lead you miles off course from the direction of your goals and the life you desire. See Figure 6. Most people drift through life without devoting much conscious energy to figuring out specifically what they want and what they need to do to take themselves there. I want to show you how to ignite your passion and help you aim your unstoppable creative power in the direction of your heart’s dreams and desires. Uprooting bad habits that have grown into mighty oaks is going to be arduous and difficult. To see the process through will require something greater than even the most relentless determination—willpower alone won’t cut it. Fig. 6 The power of small adjustments: a 1 percent change in course results in being 150 miles off course. Finding Your Mojo—Your Why-Power Assuming willpower is what you need to change your habits is akin to trying to keep a hungry grizzly bear out of your picnic basket by covering it with a napkin. To fight the bear of your bad habits, you need something stronger. When you’re having trouble doing the hard work of achieving your goals, it’s common to believe you simply lack willpower. I disagree. It’s not enough to choose to be successful. What’s going to keep you consistent with the new positive choices you need to make? What’s going to stop you from falling back into your mindless bad habits? What’s going to be different this time versus the times you’ve tried and failed before? As soon as you get the slightest bit uncomfortable, you’re going to be tempted to slide back into your old, comfortable routine. You’ve tried willpower before and it’s failed you. You’ve set resolutions and you’ve let them go. You thought you were going to lose all that weight last time. You thought you’d make all those sales calls last year. Let’s “stop the insanity” and do something different so you can get different and better results. Forget about willpower. It’s time for why-power. Your choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams. The wisest and most motivating choices are the ones aligned with that which you identify as your purpose, your core self, and your highest values. You’ve got to want something, and know why you want it, or you’ll end up giving up too easily. So, what is your why? You’ve got to have a reason if you want to make significant improvements to your life. And to make you want to make the necessary changes, your why must be something that is fantastically motivating—to you. You’ve got to want to get up and go, go, go, go, go—for years! So, what is it that moves you the most? Identifying your why is critical. What motivates you is the ignition to your passion, the source for your enthusiasm, and the fuel of your persistence. This is so important that I made it the focus of another book, Living Your Best Year Ever: A Proven System for Achieving BIG GOALS (LivingYourBestYearEver.com). You MUST know your why. Why Everything’s Possible The power of your why is what gets you to stick through the grueling, mundane, and laborious. All of the hows will be meaningless until your whys are powerful enough. Until you’ve set your desire and motivation in place, you’ll abandon any new path you seek to better your life. If your why-power—your desire—isn’t great enough, if the fortitude of your commitment isn’t powerful enough, you’ll end up like every other person who makes a New Year’s resolution and gives up too quickly and reverts to sleepwalking through poor choices. Let me give you an analogy to help bring it home. If I were to put a ten-inch-wide, thirty-foot-long plank on the ground and say, “If you walk the length of the plank, I’ll give you twenty dollars,” would you do it? Of course, it’s an easy twenty bucks. But what if I took that same plank and made a roof-top “bridge” between two 100-story buildings? That same twenty dollars for walking the thirty-foot plank no longer looks desirable or even possible, does it? You’d look at me and say, “Not on your life.” See Figure 7. However, if your child was on the opposite building, and that building was on fire, would you walk the length of the plank to save him or her? Without question and immediately—you’d do it, twenty dollars or not. Fig. 7 Is your why-power great enough? Why is it that the first time I asked you to cross that sky-high plank, you said no way, yet, the second time you wouldn’t hesitate? The risks and the dangers are the same. What changed? Your why changed—your reason for wanting to do it. You see, when the reason is big enough, you will be willing to perform almost any how. To truly ignite your creative potential and inner drive, you have to look beyond the motivation of monetary and material goals. It’s not that those motivations are bad. In fact, they’re great. I’m a connoisseur of nice things. But material stuff can’t really recruit your heart, soul, and guts into the fight. That passion has to come from a deeper place. And, even if you acquire the shiny object(s), you won’t capture the real prize—happiness and fulfillment. In my interview with peak-performance expert Tony Robbins, he said: “I have seen business moguls achieve their ultimate goals, but still live in frustration, worry, and fear. What’s preventing these successful people from being happy? The answer is they have focused only on achievement and not fulfillment. Extraordinary accomplishment does not guarantee extraordinary joy, happiness, love, and a sense of meaning. These two skill sets feed off each other, and makes me believe that success without fulfillment is failure.” Well said. That’s why it’s not enough to choose to be successful. You have to dig deeper than that to find your core motivation, to activate your superpower. Your why-power. Core Motivation The access point to your why-power is through your core values, which define both who you are and what you stand for. Your core values are your internal compass, your guiding beacon, your personal GPS. They act as the filter through which you run all of life’s demands, requests, and temptations, making sure they’re leading you toward your intended destination. Getting your core values defined and properly calibrated is one of the most important steps in redirecting your life toward your grandest vision. If you haven’t already clearly defined your values, you may find yourself making choices that conflict with what you want. If, for example, honesty is a big thing for you, but you hang out with liars, there’s a conflict. When your actions conflict with your values, you’ll end up unhappy, frustrated, and despondent. In fact, psychologists tell us that nothing creates more stress than when our actions and behaviors aren’t congruent with our values. Defining your core values also helps make life simpler and more efficient. Decision-making is also easier when you are certain of your core values. Once I went through the practice of figuring out my own core values and boiled it down to the top three—Growth, Excellence, and Impact—decision-making at both the macro and micro level became much more clear and purposeful. When faced with a choice, ask yourself, “Does this align with my core values?” If it does, do it. If not, don’t, and don’t look back. All fretting and indecision are eliminated. TO IDENTIFY YOUR CORE VALUES, USE THE CORE VALUES ASSESSMENT WORKSHEET THAT CAN BE DOWNLOADED AT THECOMPOUNDEFFECT.COM/RESOURCES Find Your Fight People are either motivated by something they want or something they don’t want. Love is a powerfully motivating force. But so is hate. Contrary to social correctness, it can be good to hate. Hate disease, hate injustice, hate ignorance, hate complacency, and so on. Sometimes identifying an enemy lights your fire. Some of my greatest motivation, determination, and dogged persistence came when I had an enemy to fight. In history, the most transformational stories and political revolutions came about as a result of fighting an enemy. David had Goliath. America had the British. Luke had Darth Vader. Rocky had Apollo Creed. Twenty-somethings have “The Man.” Pepsi has Coke. DC has Marvel Comics. Taylor Swift has Kanye West. We could go on and on, but you get the point. Enemies give us a reason to stand tall with courage. Having to fight challenges your skills, your character, and your resolve. It forces you to assess and exercise your talents and abilities. Without a motivating fight, we can become fat and lazy; we lose our strength and purpose. Some of my mentorship clients worry that their why-power derives from less-than-noble goals. They feel guilty for wanting to prove the naysayers wrong. Or wanting to get back at the person who said they’d never amount to anything, or beat the competition, or finally one-up a sibling who always dominated them. But, really, it doesn’t matter what the motivation is (as long as it is legal and moral). You don’t have to be motivated for great humanitarian reasons. What matters is that you feel fully motivated. Sometimes that motivation can help you use a powerfully negative emotion or experience to create an even more powerful and successful end. This is certainly true of one of history’s most celebrated football coaches, Pete Carroll. Pete explained his early motivation to me like this: “When I grew up, I was a little dink. I couldn’t do much because I was just too small. It took me a couple years to get in a place where I could be competitive. All that time, I was living with the fact that I was much better and I needed to fight to prove it. I was frustrated because I knew I could be special.” Carroll’s need to fight ultimately brought out his greatness. In an interview with acclaimed actor Anthony Hopkins, I was surprised to learn that his extraordinary talent and determination blossomed from anger. Hopkins admitted to being a horrible student, burdened with dyslexia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder before such diagnoses existed. He was shackled with the label “problem child.” “I was a source of worry for my parents,” Hopkins revealed. “I had no apparent future because schooling and education were important, but I didn’t seem to have the ability to grasp what was being taught to me. My cousins were all brilliant; I felt resentful and rejected by a whole society and was very depressed.” Hopkins harnessed his anger. At first it propelled him to fight to achieve success outside of academics or athletics. He discovered he had a glimmer of talent in acting. So, he used his anger toward the belittling labels he’d been given to fuel his commitment to the craft of acting. Today, Hopkins is considered one of the greatest actors alive. As a result of the fame and fortune he’s acquired, Hopkins has been able to help countless people in the fight to recover from substance abuse, in addition to supporting important environmental work. Though, initially, it wasn’t grounded in a “noble” cause, his fight was clearly worthwhile. We can all make powerful choices. We can all take back control by not blaming chance, fate, or anyone else for our outcomes. It’s within our ability to create change. Rather than letting past hurtful experiences sap our energy and sabotage our success, we can use them to fuel positive, constructive change. Goals As I mentioned before, the Compound Effect is always working, and it will always take you somewhere. The question is, where? You can harness this relentless force and have it carry you to new heights. But you must know where you want to go. What goals, dreams, and destinations do you desire? When I attended the funeral of Paul J. Meyer, another mentor of mine, I was reminded of the richness and diversity of his life. He achieved, experienced, and contributed more than dozens of people combined. His obituary made me reassess the quantity and size of the goals I set for myself. If Paul were here, he would tell us, “If you are not making the progress that you would like to make and are capable of making, it is simply because your goals are not clearly defined.” One of Paul’s most memorable quotes reminds us of the importance of goals: “Whatever you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon… must inevitably come to pass!” The one skill most responsible for the abundance in my life is learning how to effectively set and achieve goals. Something almost magical happens when you organize and focus your creative power on a well-defined target. I’ve seen this time and again: the highest achievers in the world have all succeeded because they mapped out their visions. The person who has a clear, compelling, and white-hot burning why will always defeat even the best of the best at doing the how. TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU MIGHT NEED TO ADJUST YOUR GOALS, DOWNLOAD THE LIFE ASSESSMENT WORKSHEET AT THECOMPOUNDEFFECT.COM/RESOURCES How Goal Setting Actually Works: The Mystery “Secret” Revealed You only see, experience, and get what you look for. If you don’t know what to look for, you certainly won’t get it. By our very nature, we are goal-seeking creatures. Our brain is always trying to align our outer world with what we’re seeing and expecting in our inner world. So, when you instruct your brain to look for the things you want, you will begin to see them. In fact, the object of your desire has probably always existed around you, but your mind and eyes weren’t open to “seeing” it. In reality, this is how the Law of Attraction really works. It is not the mysterious, esoteric voodoo it sometimes sounds like. It’s far simpler and more practical than that. We are bombarded with billions of sensory (visual, audio, physical) bites of information each day. To keep ourselves from going insane, we ignore 99.9 percent of them, only really seeing, hearing, or experiencing those upon which our mind focuses. This is why, when you “think” something, it appears that you are miraculously drawing it into your life. In reality, you’re now just seeing what was already there. You are truly “attracting” it into your life. It wasn’t there before or accessible to you until your thoughts focused and directed your mind to see it. Make sense? This isn’t mysterious at all. It’s actually quite logical. Now, with this new perception, whatever your mind is thinking internally is what it will focus on and all of a sudden “see” within that 99.9 percent of remaining space. Here’s a well-worn example (because it’s so true!): While shopping for or buying a new car, you suddenly start to see that model and make everywhere, right? It seems like there are tons of them on the streets all of a sudden when they weren’t there yesterday. But is that realistic? Of course not. They were there all along, but you weren’t paying attention to them. Thus, they didn’t really “exist” to you until you gave them your attention. When you define your goals, you give your brain something new to look for and focus on. It’s as if you’re giving your mind a new set of eyes through which to see all the people, circumstances, conversations, resources, ideas, and creativity surrounding you. With this new perspective (an inner itinerary), your mind proceeds to match up on the outside what you want most on the inside—your goal. It’s that simple. The difference in how you experience the world and draw ideas, people, and opportunities into your life after you have clearly defined your goals is profound. In one of my interviews with Brian Tracy, he put it this way: “Top people have very clear goals. They know who they are and they know what they want. They write it down and they make plans for its accomplishment. Unsuccessful people carry their goals around in their head like marbles rattling around in a can, and we say a goal that is not in writing is merely a fantasy. And everybody has fantasies, but those fantasies are like bullets with no powder in the cartridge. People go through life shooting blanks without written goals—and that’s the starting point.” I suggest that you take some time today to make a list of your most important goals. I recommend considering goals in all aspects of your life, not just for your business or finances. Be wary of the high price of putting too much focus on any single aspect of your life, to the exclusion of everything else. Go for whole-life success—balance in all the aspects of life that are important to you: business, finances, health and well-being, spirituality, family and relationships, and lifestyle. THE SYSTEM I USE FOR SETTING AND ACHIEVING BIG GOALS CAN BE FOUND AT LIVINGYOURBESTYEAREVER.COM. Who You Have to Become When most people set out to achieve new goals, they ask, “Okay, I have my goal; now what do I need to do to get it?” It’s not a bad question, but it’s not the first question that needs to be addressed either. The question we should be asking ourselves is: “Who do I need to become?” You probably know some people who seem to do everything right, but still don’t produce the results they want, right? Why not? One principle Jim Rohn taught me is: “If you want to have more, you have to become more. Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue will elude you; it can be like trying to chase butterflies. Success is something you attract by the person you become.” When I understood that philosophy, wow! It revolutionized my life and personal growth. When I was single and ready to find my mate and get married, I made a long list of traits I desired in the perfect woman (for me). I filled more than forty pages of a journal, front and back, describing her in great detail—her personality, character, key attributes, attitudes, and philosophies about life, even what kind of family she’d come from, including her culture and physical makeup, down to the texture of her hair. I wrote in depth what our life would be like and what we’d do together. If I had simply asked, “What do I have to do to find and get this girl?” I might still be on that butterfly chase. Instead, I looked back at the list and considered whether or not I embodied those same attributes myself. Did I have the very qualities I was expecting in her? I asked myself, “What kind of a man would a woman like this be looking for? Who do I need to become to be attractive to a woman of this substance?” I filled forty more pages describing all the attributes, qualities, behaviors, attitudes, and characteristics I needed to become myself. Then I went to work on becoming and achieving those qualities. Guess what? It worked! As if she were peeled off the pages of my journal and appeared in front of me, my wife, Georgia, is exactly what I described and asked for, in almost eerie detail. The key was getting clear on who I’d have to be to attract and keep a woman of her quality, and then doing the work to achieve that. TO IDENTIFY BAD HABITS AND THE NEEDED NEW HABITS ESSENTIAL TO BECOMING AND ACHIEVING WHAT YOU WANT, DOWNLOAD THE HABIT ASSESSMENT SHEET BY VISITING THECOMPOUNDEFFECT.COM/RESOURCES Behave Yourself Alright, let’s map out your process for achieving the goals you’ve decided upon. This is the doing process—or, in some cases, the STOP-doing process. What stands between you and your goal is your behavior. Do you need to stop doing anything so the Compound Effect isn’t taking you into a downward spiral? Similarly, what do you need to start doing to change your trajectory so that it’s headed in the most beneficial direction? In other words, what habits and behaviors do you need to subtract from and add to your life? Your life comes down to this formula: That’s why it’s imperative to figure out which behaviors are blocking the path that leads to your goal, and which behaviors will help you accomplish your goal. You may think you’ve got a handle on all your bad habits, but I’d bet good money you’re wrong. Again, that’s why tracking is so effective. I mean, honestly, do you know how many hours of TV you really watch every day? How many hours do you spend tuned in to news channels or keeping up with the goals and accomplishments of others on the sports or style networks? Do you know how many cans of soda you drink? Or how many hours you spend doing nonessential “work” on the computer scrolling through social media? As I emphasized in the previous chapter, your first job is to become aware of how you’re behaving. Where have you fallen asleep on the job and developed an unconscious bad habit that’s leading you astray? Not long ago, a successful executive with whom I serve on a nonprofit board hired me to mentor him to improve his productivity. He was doing well, but knew he could optimize his time and output further with some coaching. I had him track his activities for a week and I noticed something I see too often: He spent an incredible amount of time reviewing the news—forty-five minutes in the morning reading the newspaper, another thirty minutes listening to news on his morning commute, and an equal amount of time tuning in again on his drive back home. During his workday, he’d check online news updates several times, spending at least twenty minutes in total. When he got home, he’d catch the last fifteen minutes of the local news while greeting his family. Then he’d catch up on thirty minutes of sports news and thirty minutes of the 10-o’clock news before going to bed. In total, he was spending 3.5 hours with the news each day! This man wasn’t an economist or a commodities trader, or in any profession that lived or died by the latest news. The time he spent with the paper and news programs on radio and TV greatly exceeded what he needed to be a knowledgeable voter and contributing member of society, or even to enhance his own personal interests. In fact, he was getting very little valuable information through his programming choices—or, rather, his lack of choices. So why did he spend nearly four hours a day consuming it? It was a habit. I suggested he keep his TV and radio off, cancel his newspaper subscription, and set up a single industry news aggregator so he could select and receive only the news he deemed important for his business and personal interests. Doing so immediately cleared out 95 percent of the mind-cluttering and time-sucking noise. He could now review all that mattered to him in less than twenty minutes a day. This left the forty-five minutes in the morning (his commute time) and that hour in the evening for productive activities: exercise, listening to instructional and inspirational material, reading, planning, preparing, and spending quality time with his family. He tells me he’s never felt less stressed (constant negative news has a tendency to make you anxious) and more inspired and focused than he does now. One small, simple change in habit, one giant leap forward in balance and productivity! In case that example didn’t fully resonate with you because you’re not a news addict, let’s give this one a try. I’m pretty confident you’ll be able to relate to this example, because it’s something that impacts so many people in our highly connected world today (myself included!). It’s a phenomenon psychologists call “Digiphrenia.” It is a mental condition caused by the constant bombardment of digital input. I discuss this phenomenon and how important it is to combat this bad habit in my INSANE PRODUCTIVITY curriculum (InsaneProductivity.com). Habits surrounding technology overuse are so common today that most aren’t even aware of how much it is destroying our capacity to keep our focus, stay on track, and make progress on our goals. Having these open portals, with the world having direct 24/7/365 access to our attention, is a new reality that most haven’t figured out how to properly manage. The technology we designed to make life easier and more productive has done just the opposite. Technology is a great tool but a terrible master. We have quickly become its slave. One member of INSANE PRODUCTIVITY, Sergio, explained it this way, saying, “Digiphrenia has had a large effect on my productivity. I had never realized how much time it was taking away from my day. The worst part is that there was no easy way for me to track how often and how long I was spending on my mobile phone. I finally installed an application that tracks how long the screen is left on. I was shocked to find out that I was spending four to five hours on my device per day and that I would check it nearly 150 times a day.” Pete, another INSANE PRODUCTIVITY alum, revealed, “I thought my behaviors were normal, but my iPhone and computer were ruling my life. I was checking my emails every couple of minutes (including before bed and when waking), sending text messages, checking the news multiple times an hour, checking my home (temp and door locks), and many more things. The distractions had a negative impact on my ability to be engaged with my customers and family members. My multiple computer monitors had at least five applications open/live at all times. During phone conversations, I would also be checking RSS feeds, shopping, reading/responding to emails.” I’m happy to report that both Sergio and Pete, two of our more than 35,000 alumni, were able to gain back control over their technology and kiss Digiphrenia goodbye. Just like high-volume, low-nutrient food makes your body fat, high-volume, low-nutrient information makes your head fat. Allow too much distraction by technology and you will end up with diabetes of the mind. Okay, now it’s your turn. Get out your little notebook and write out your top three goals. Now make a list of the bad habits that might be sabotaging your progress in each area. Write down every one. Habits and behaviors never lie. If there’s a discrepancy between what you say and what you do, I’m going to believe what you do every time. If you tell me you want to be healthy, but you’ve got Doritos dust on your fingers, I’m believing the Doritos. If you say self-improvement is a priority, but you spend more time with your Xbox than at the library, I’m believing the Xbox. If you say you’re a dedicated professional, but you show up late and unprepared, your behavior rats you out every time. You say your family is your top priority, but if they don’t appear on your busy calendar, they aren’t, really. Look at the list of bad habits you just made. That’s the truth about who you are. Now you get to decide whether that’s okay, or if you want to change. Next, add to that list all the habits you need to adopt that, practiced and compounded over time, will result in you gloriously achieving your goals. Making this list isn’t about wasting energy by getting judgmental and regretful. It’s about taking a clear-headed look at what you want to improve. I’m not going to leave you there, however. Let’s uproot those sabotaging bad habits and plant new, positive, and healthy ones in their place. Game Changers: Five Strategies for Eliminating Bad Habits Your habits are learned. Therefore, they can be unlearned. If you want to sail your life in a new direction, you have to first pick up the anchors of bad habits that have been weighing you down. The key is to make your why-power so strong that it overwhelms your urges for instant gratification. And for that, you need a new game plan. The following are my all-time favorite game changers: 1. Identify Your Triggers Look at your list of bad habits. For each one you’ve written down, identify what triggers it. Figure out what I call “The Big 4’s”—the “who,” the “what,” the “where,” and the “when” underlying each bad behavior. For example: • Are you more likely to drink too much when you’re with certain people? • Is there a particular time of day when you just have to have something sweet? • What emotions tend to provoke your worst habits—stress, fatigue, anger, nervousness, boredom? • When do you experience those emotions? Who are you with, where are you, or what are you doing? • What situations prompt your bad habits to surface—getting in your car, the time before performance reviews, visits with your in-laws? Conferences? Social settings? Feeling physically insecure? Deadlines? • Take a closer look at your routines. What do you typically say when you wake up? When you’re on a coffee or lunch break? When you’ve gotten home from a long day? Again, get out your notebook or use the Bad Habit Killer Worksheet (download for free at TheCompoundEffect.com/Resources). Now write down your triggers. This simple action alone increases your awareness exponentially. But, of course, this isn’t the whole enchilada, because as we’ve discussed, increasing your awareness of a bad habit isn’t enough to break it. 2. Clean House Get to scrubbin’. And I mean this literally and figuratively. If you want to stop drinking alcohol, remove every drop of it from your house. Get rid of the glasses, any fancy utensils or doo-dads you use when you drink, and those decorative olives, too. If you want to stop watching so much television at night, cancel all your cable, Netflix, and other subscription services. If you’re trying to curb your spending, take an evening and cancel every catalogue or retail offer that flies in through your mailbox or your inbox, so you won’t even need to muster the discipline to walk it from the front door to the recycle bin. If you want to eat more healthfully, clean your cupboards of all the crap, stop buying the junk food—and stop buying into the argument that it’s “not fair” to deny the other people in your family junk food simply because you don’t want it in your life. Everyone in your family is better off without it. Don’t bring it into the house, period. Get rid of whatever enables your bad habits. 3. Swap It Look again at your list of bad habits. How can you alter them so that they’re not as harmful? Can you replace them with healthier habits or drop-kick them altogether? As in, for good. Anyone who knows me knows that I love something sweet after a meal. If there is ice cream in the house, the something sweet turns into a triple-scoop banana split with all the fixings (1,255 calories). Instead, I replaced that bad habit with two Hershey’s Kisses (50 calories). And in more recent years, I’ve kicked the swap up a notch even further by treating myself to homemade gelatin with whipped cream (not the store-bought, sugar-filled stuff). I’m still able to satisfy the sweet tooth without having to spend the extra hour on the treadmill just to get back to even. My sister-in-law started a habit of eating crunchy and salty junk food when she watched TV. She’d crunch through a whole bag of tortilla chips with little actual awareness. Then she realized that what she really enjoyed was the crunchy sensation in her mouth. She decided to replace her bad habit with crunching on carrot and celery sticks, and raw broccoli spears. She got the same joyful sensation, and her FDA-recommended vegetable servings at the same time. A guy who used to work for me had a habit of drinking eight to ten Diet Cokes a day (that’s a BAD habit!). I suggested he replace them with low-sodium, carbonated water, adding fresh lemon, lime, or oranges. He did this for about a month before realizing he didn’t need the carbonation at all, and switched to just plain water. Play with this, and see what behaviors you can replace, delete, or swap out. 4. Ease In I live near the Pacific Ocean. Whenever I get in the water, I get my ankles acclimated first, then walk in up to my knees, then it’s my waist and chest, before taking the plunge. Some people just run and dive in and get it over with—good for them. Not me. I like to ease my way in (probably residual trauma from my childhood, as you’ll see in the next strategy). For some of your long-standing and deep-rooted habits, it may be more effective to take small steps to ease into unwinding them. You might have spent decades repeating, cementing, and fortifying those habits, so it may be wise to give yourself some time to unravel them, one step at a time. A few years ago, my wife’s doctor required she cut out caffeine from her diet for several months. We both love our coffee, so if she was going to have to suffer, I decided it was only fair that we do it together. We first went to 50/50—50 percent decaffeinated and 50 percent regular for a week. Then 100 percent decaf for another week. Then Earl Grey decaf tea for a week, followed by decaf green tea. It took us a month to get there, but we didn’t suffer even a moment of caffeine withdrawal—no headaches, no sleepiness, no brain fog, no nothing. However, if we had gone cold turkey… well, I shiver at the thought. 5. Jump In Not everyone is wired the same way. Some researchers have found that it can be paradoxically easier for people to make lifestyle changes if they change many bad habits at once. For example, pioneering cardiologist Dr. Dean Ornish found he could reverse people’s advanced heart disease—without medication or surgery—with dramatic lifestyle changes. He discovered they often found it easier to say goodbye to almost all their bad habits at once. He enrolled them in a training session where he substituted a very low-fat diet for their fat- and cholesterol-rich fare. The program included exercise—getting them off their couches and walking or jogging—as well as stress-reduction techniques, and other heart-healthy habits. Amazingly, in less than a month, these patients learned to let go of a lifetime of bad habits and embrace new ones—and they went on to experience dramatic health benefits after a year as a result. Personally, I find this to be the exception, not the rule, but you’ll have to figure out the strategy that works best for you. When I was a kid, my family camped at a little-known spot called Lake Rollins. The lake, situated not far from the Sierras in Northern California, is fed from glaciers that melt from atop the mountains of Lake Tahoe. The water’s ridiculously cold. Every day we were there, my dad insisted that I water ski in the polar pond. All day I would be quietly anxious about the dreaded call to go in. I loved to water ski. I just hated getting in the water. A slight conflict of interest, because of course, there was no separating one from the other. Dad made sure that I never missed my turn, sometimes by actually physically throwing me in. After a dozen or so excruciating seconds of near-hypothermia, I always found the water refreshing and rejuvenating. My anticipation of getting in the water was actually worse than the reality of just jumping in. Once my body acclimated, water skiing was a blast. And, yet, I went through this cycle of dread and relief each and every time. That experience isn’t unlike suddenly dropping or changing a bad habit. For a short while, it may feel excruciating or at least quite uncomfortable. But similar to the body adjusting to a changing environment through a process called homeostasis, we have a similar homeostatic ability to adjust to unfamiliar behavior changes. And usually, we are able to regulate ourselves physiologically and psychologically to the new circumstances quite quickly. Sometimes wading in won’t do. Sometimes you really do have to jump in full force. Ask yourself now, “Where can I start slow and hold myself accountable?” And, “Where do I need to take that bigger leap? Where have I been avoiding pain or discomfort, when I know deep down that I’ll adapt in no time if I just go for it?” One of my former partners has a brother who was a beer-guzzling, bar-brawling, life-of-the-party alcoholic. He drank at lunch, dinner, after dinner, and all weekend long. One day he was at a wedding for a former college roommate when he saw his friend’s brother, who was ten years older than both of them, but looked ten years younger! He watched the man dance, laugh, and play during the wedding, exuding a vitality he hadn’t felt in many years. He made a decision on the spot that he would never touch a drop of alcohol again. Cold turkey, that was it, never again. And he hasn’t since, now some fifteen years later. When it comes to changing bad habits at home, I’m a toe dipper. But in my professional life, I find that taking the big plunge is far more effective. Whether committing to a new business or dealing with potential new clients, partners, or investors, toe dipping usually doesn’t cut it. Each time, I think of Lake Rollins and know it will be painful at first, but I remember that within little time, it will be exhilarating, and well worth the temporary discomfort. Run a Vice Check I’m not suggesting you cut out every “bad” thing in your life. Most everything is good in moderation. But, how can you tell whether a bad habit is becoming the boss of you? I believe in testing my vices. Every so often I go on a “vice fast.” I pick one vice and check to be sure I’m still the alpha dog in our relationship. My vices are coffee, ice cream, wine, and movies. I already told you about my ice cream obsession. When it comes to wine, I want to be sure I’m enjoying a glass and celebrating the day, not drowning a bad mood. About every three months, I pick one vice and abstain for thirty days (this probably stems from my Catholic Lent upbringing). I love proving to myself that I’m still in charge. Try this yourself. Pick a vice—something you do in moderation, but you know doesn’t contribute to your highest good—and take yourself on a thirty-day wagon run. If you find it seriously difficult to abstain for those thirty days, you may have found a habit worth cutting out of your life. Game Changers: Six Techniques for Installing Good Habits Now that we have helped you eliminate the bad habits that are taking you in the wrong direction, we need to create new choices, behaviors, and ultimately habits that will finally take you in the direction of your grandest desires. Eliminating a bad habit means removing something from your routine. Installing a new, more productive habit requires an entirely different skill set. You’re planting the tree, watering it, fertilizing it, and making sure it’s properly rooted. Doing so takes effort, time, and practice. Here are my favorite techniques for putting good habits in place. Leadership expert John C. Maxwell said, “You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.” According to research, it takes three hundred instances of positive reinforcement to turn a new habit into an unconscious practice—that’s almost a year of daily practice! Fortunately, as we talked about earlier, we know we have a much better chance of cementing a new habit into our lives after three weeks of diligent focus. That means that if we bring special attention to a new habit daily for the first three weeks, we have a far better chance of making it a lifelong practice. The truth is, you can change a habit in a second or you can still be trying to break it after ten long years. The first time you touched a hot stove, you instantly knew you’d never make that a habit! The shock and pain were so intense that they forever changed your awareness. You knew you’d be conscious for the rest of your life around hot stoves. The key is staying aware. If you really want to maintain a good habit, make sure you pay attention to it at least once a day and you’re far more likely to succeed. 1. Set Yourself Up to Succeed Any new habit has to work inside your life and lifestyle. If you join a gym that’s twenty miles away, you won’t go. If you’re a night owl, but the gym closes at 6 p.m., it won’t work for you. Your gym must be close and convenient, and fit into your schedule. If you want to lose weight and eat healthier, make sure your fridge and pantry are stocked with healthy options. Want to make sure you don’t binge on vending machine snacks when you get midday hunger pangs? Keep nuts and healthy snacks in your desk drawer. The easiest and most tempting type of food to grab when you’re hungry are empty carbs. One strategy I use is to have protein on hand. I grill up a bunch of proteins on Sunday and package it and have it ready for the week. One of my most distracting and destructive habits is my e-mail addiction. Seriously, this is no laughing matter. I can lose hours of focus every day with the massive amounts of e-mail flooding my inbox if I’m not vigilant about staying organized and focused. To set up the discipline of my new habit of only checking e-mail three times a day, I turned off all alarms, all automatic-receive functions, and shut the program down when I’m not in one of those three windows of allocated time. I have to build the walls around that time vortex, lest I keep falling in all day. 2. Think Addition, Not Subtraction I picked up a great tip spending time with former talk show host Montel Williams. He told me about the strict diet he maintains because of the disease that afflicts him, multiple sclerosis. Montel has adopted something called “The Add-in Principle,” and I think it’s a wildly effective tool for anyone with any goal. “It’s not so much what you attempt to take out of your diet,” he explained to me. “It’s what you put in instead.” This has become his analogy for life. Instead of thinking that he has to deprive himself or take something out of his diet (e.g., “I can’t eat a hamburger, chocolate, or dairy”), he thinks about what he can have instead (e.g., “Today I’m going to have a salad and steamed vegetables and fresh figs”). He fills his focus and his belly with what he can have, so he no longer has attention or hunger for what he can’t. Instead of focusing on what he has to sacrifice, Montel thinks about what he gets to “add in.” The result is a lot more powerful. A friend of mine wanted to break his bad habit of wasting too much time watching TV. To help out, I asked him what he’d like to do with three hours of free time if he had it. He said he would play with his kids more. I also asked him to pick a hobby he’d always wanted to explore. His choice was photography. A total techie, he went out and got all this high-tech editing equipment, which he happily toted along on more family outings, so he could take great photos of his kids. Then he’d spend hours in the evening editing and putting together slide shows and photo albums for the whole family to enjoy. They ended up spending time together, laughing and remembering how much fun they’d had. Because he was so focused on his kids and photography, he no longer had the time nor the desire to sit around and watch TV at night. He realized he’d been zoning out on it because it was an easy mental escape from his workday. By replacing TV viewing with his new habit of playing games with his kids and working on his photography hobby, he discovered passions with far more power and far bigger payoffs. What can you choose to “add in” so you can enrich your life experience? 3. Go for a PDA: Public Display of Accountability Picture any public official taking the oath of office. “I do solemnly swear…” and then comes the speech on how she’ll turn her campaign promises into boots-on-the-ground realities. Once she puts it out there on the public record, she knows that she’ll be held responsible for any action that rolls back on her promises and praised for any progress toward her goals. Want to cement that new habit? Get Big Brother to watch you. It’s never been easier with all the social media available. I heard about one woman who decided to gain control of her finances by blogging about every penny she spends every day. She’s got her family, friends, and plenty of colleagues following her spending habits, and as a result of the many eyes of scrutiny, she’s become far more responsible and disciplined in her finances. I once helped a co-worker quit smoking by telling everyone at the company: “Listen up! Zelda’s decided to stop smoking! Isn’t that great? She just smoked her last cigarette!” I then placed a huge wall calendar on the outside of her cubicle. Every day she didn’t smoke, Zelda got to draw a big fat red X on the calendar. Co-workers took notice and started to cheer her on. The parade of big red X’s started to fill up the chart, which took on a life of its own. Zelda didn’t want to quit on that chart, quit on her co-workers, or quit on herself. But she did quit smoking! Tell your family. Tell your friends. Tell Facebook and Twitter. Get the word out that there’s a new sheriff in town and you’re in charge. 4. Find a Success Buddy There are few things as powerful as two people locked arm and arm marching toward the same goal. To up your chances of success, get a success buddy, someone who’ll keep you accountable as you cement your new habit while you return the favor. I, for example, have what I call a “Peak-Performance Partner.” Every Friday at 11 a.m. sharp, we have a thirty-minute call during which we trade our wins, losses, fixes, ah-has, and solicit the needed feedback and hold each other accountable. You might seek out a success buddy for regular walks, runs, or dates at the gym, or to meet to discuss and trade personal-development books. 5. Competition & Camaraderie There’s nothing like a friendly contest to whet your competitive spirit and immerse yourself in a new habit with a bang. To give an example of this, last summer I organized a consistency challenge for our 350,000+ DarrenDaily members. We called it the 90-day Raven Run challenge, named after the famous South Beach runner Robert “Raven” Kraft. Raven has run eight miles on the white sands of South Beach, Miami, for more than forty-five years (at the time of this writing). He has never missed a single day (through hurricanes, shin splints, broken bones, food poisoning, pneumonia, and more). The challenge was simple: run at least one mile a day, every day, for a 90-day streak. Hey, if Raven can run eight miles for 16,500+ days (and counting), we can do one for 90 days—no excuses. Admittedly, I knew many DarrenDaily members would begin the challenge, but I confess, I didn’t think most would finish. In fact, I bet my team that not even 10 percent would maintain the streak. Lack of consistency is the Achilles heel of the human species. What I didn’t account for was the power of competition and the fuel of camaraderie. More than three times the number I predicted completed the challenge successfully! Yet, as soon as the competition was over, I was fascinated to observe that the exercise consistency dropped off the cliff—by more than 60 percent only one month after the competition. When we organized another competition, the engagement and consistency shot right back up. All it takes is a little competition to keep people’s engines revved—and they also get a shared experience, a wonderful sense of community, and fun camaraderie in the bargain. What kind of friendly competition can you organize with your friends, colleagues, or teammates? How can you inject fun rivalry and a competitive spirit into your new habit? 6. Celebrate! “All work and no play make Jack a dull boy,” and it’s a recipe for backsliding. There should be a time to celebrate and enjoy some of the fruits of your victories along the way. You can’t go through this thing sacrificing yourself with no benefit. You’ve got to find little rewards to give yourself every month, every week, every day—even something small to acknowledge that you’ve held yourself to a new behavior. Maybe time to yourself to take a walk, relax in the bath, or read something just for fun. For bigger milestones, book a massage or have dinner at your favorite restaurant. Promise yourself a nice big pot of gold when you reach the end of the rainbow. Change Is Hard: Yippee! There is one thing that 99 percent of “failures” and “successful” folks have in common—they all hate doing the same things. The difference is, successful people do them anyway. Change is hard. That’s why people don’t transform their bad habits and why so many people end up unhappy and unhealthy. What excites me about this reality, however, is that if change were easy, and everyone were doing it, it would be much more difficult for you and me to stand out and become an extraordinary success. Ordinary is easy. Extra-ordinary is what will separate you from the crowd. Personally, I’m always happy when something is hard. Why? Because I know that most people won’t do what it takes. Therefore, it will be easier for me to step in front of the pack and take the lead. I love what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said so eloquently: “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge.” When you press on despite difficulty, tedium, and hardship, that’s when you earn your improvement and gain strides on the competition. If it’s hard, awkward, or tedious, so be it. Just do it. And keep doing it, and the magic of the Compound Effect will reward you handsomely. Be Patient When it comes to breaking old bad habits and starting new ones, remember to be patient with yourself. If you’ve spent twenty, thirty, or forty years or more repeating the behaviors you’re now trying to change, you have to expect it’s going to take time and effort before you see lasting results. Science shows that patterns of thoughts and actions repeated many times create what’s called a neuro-signature or a “brain groove.” This is a series of interconnected neurons that carry the thought patterns of a particular habit. Attention feeds the habit. When we give our attention to a habit, we activate the brain groove, releasing the thoughts, desires, and actions related to that habit. Luckily, our brains are malleable. If we stop giving attention to the bad habits, those grooves weaken. When we form new habits, we drive new grooves deeper with each repetition, eventually overpowering the previous ones. Creating new habits (and burning new grooves into your brain) will take time. Be patient with yourself. If you fall off the wagon, brush yourself off (don’t beat yourself up!), and get back on. No problem. We all stumble. Just go again and try another strategy. Reinforce your commitment and consistency. When you press on, you will receive huge payoffs. Speaking of payoffs, the next chapter is where we really start breaking away from the herd. This is where the multiplying effect really takes shape. With all the disciplined effort you’ve applied from the fundamentals of the first three chapters, what’s coming up next is where you get rewarded—big time!","output":"Chapter 3 of \\"The Compound Effect\\" by Darren Hardy focuses on the power of habits in shaping our lives. The core message is that habits are like trees; the longer they're in place, the deeper their roots grow, and the harder they are to change. However, with awareness and consistent effort, we can develop new, healthier habits that move us toward success. Some key points from Chapter 3 include: 1. **Understanding Habits**: Habits form over time through repeated behavior. They can make life easier because they automate actions, freeing up mental energy for other tasks. However, bad habits can derail us from our desired path. 2. **Taking Control**: To change our lives, we must first control our habits. This includes identifying and altering habits that do not serve us, while establishing new ones that align with our goals. 3. **Instant Gratification Trap**: It's essential to resist the lure of instant gratification and focus on long-term rewards. Without a powerful reason (your \\"why-power\\"), it's easy to fall back into old habits. 4. **The Compound Effect**: Small adjustments in our daily habits can have a profound impact over time. Even a 1% change in direction can lead us to a significantly different destination. 5. **Goal Setting**: Identifying clear, specific goals and consistently working towards them is crucial. Goals should be rooted in your core values and should excite you enough to maintain the necessary habits. 6. **Becoming the Right Person**: Often, we need to focus not solely on what we need to do, but also on who we need to become to reach our goals. This might involve developing new skills, attitudes, or traits that support our objectives. 7. **Strategies for Changing Habits**: The chapter provides practical strategies for both eradicating bad habits (identifying triggers, cleaning house, swapping habits, easing in, jumping in) and developing good ones (setting yourself up for success, thinking addition not subtraction, public accountability, success buddy, competition, and celebration). Implementing the lessons from Chapter 3 involves conscious effort and discipline. To apply these concepts, one can start by: - **Reflecting on Habits**: Take inventory of current habits, identify which are constructive and which are detrimental, and gain clarity on the triggers and outcomes of these behaviors. - **Setting Clear Goals**: Define specific, measurable, and time-bound goals that resonate with your core values and desired life direction. - **Developing New Habits**: Use the strategies outlined to gently remove bad habits and establish new, beneficial ones. This includes finding ways to hold yourself accountable and celebrating your progress. - **Practicing Patience**: Recognize that change takes time and persistence. Be prepared to make mistakes and learn from them, instead of giving up. By adopting the principles from Chapter 3, individuals can take control of their actions and create a solid foundation for lasting change and compounding success."},{"instruction":"more","output":"Applying the lessons from Chapter 3 of \\"The Compound Effect\\" involves a multifaceted approach to creating a positive change in one's habits and ultimately in one's life. Here are additional ways to implement the concepts presented: **1. Track Your Habits**: Keep a daily log of your habits to become more aware of their frequency and triggers. Use apps or a simple notebook to track progress and setbacks. **2. Create a Supportive Environment**: Eliminate temptations that lead to bad habits and surround yourself with cues for positive behavior. For example, place workout clothes next to your bed to promote morning exercise. **3. Use Visual Reminders**: Create visual cues that align with your goals and desired habits, such as motivational quotes or images representing your objectives, to keep your focus on what matters. **4. Practice Mindfulness**: Engage in mindfulness meditation to enhance self-awareness and gain better control over your impulses and reactions. **5. Leverage Technology**: Use apps and digital tools designed to reinforce good habits and provide reminders to stay on track. Set up alerts or use habit-tracking platforms to help maintain consistency. **6. Engage in Positive Self-talk**: Replace negative thoughts about change with positive affirmations that reinforce your ability to develop new habits and achieve your goals. **7. Break Goals into Smaller Steps**: Make large goals more manageable by breaking them down into smaller, actionable steps. Celebrate each small victory to maintain motivation. **8. Seek Knowledge and Skills**: Educate yourself on the skills and knowledge required to support your new habits. For example, if eating healthily is a new goal, learn about nutrition and cooking. **9. Apply the \\"Why-Power\\"**: Constantly remind yourself of why you're working to change your habits. Write down your reasons and review them regularly to stay motivated. **10. Find Role Models**: Identify and learn from people who epitomize the success you wish to achieve. Follow their work, read their books, or even reach out for advice. **11. Use Rewards and Consequences**: Establish a system of rewards for when you stick to your new habits and consequences for when you lapse, to help reinforce behavior. **12. Commit Publicly**: Share your goals and progress with a community or support group. The added layer of accountability can provide additional motivation to stay on course. **13. Embrace Setbacks as Learning Opportunities**: Rather than viewing setbacks as failures, see them as valuable opportunities to learn and fine-tune your approach. By consistently applying these incremental strategies and maintaining a focused and proactive mindset, you can significantly enhance your ability to establish productive habits that lead to the Compound Effect—driving you towards achieving extraordinary results over time."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This friend, also close with Beyoncé, Jeff Bezos, Serena Williams, Indra Nooyi, LeBron James, Meryl Streep, and every other superachiever, will impact your life like no other. I’d like to introduce you to Mo, or “Big Mo,” as I like to call it. Big Mo is, without doubt, one of the most powerful and enigmatic forces of success. You can’t see or feel Mo, but you know when you’ve got it. You can’t count on Mo showing up to every occasion, but when it does—WOW! Big Mo can catapult you into the stratosphere of success. And once you’ve got Mo on your side, there’s almost no way anyone can catch you. I’m excited about this chapter. When you implement the ideas outlined ahead, your payoff will be a thousand times (or more) what you paid for this book. Seriously, these ideas are BIG! Harnessing the Power of Big Mo If you remember your high-school physics class (you do, don’t you?), you’ll recall Newton’s First Law, also known as the Law of Inertia: Objects at rest tend to stay at rest unless acted on by an outside force. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion, unless something stops their momentum. Put another way, couch potatoes tend to stay couch potatoes. Achievers—people who get into a successful rhythm—continue busting their butts and end up achieving more and more. It’s not easy to build momentum, but once you do, look out! Do you remember playing on merry-go-rounds when you were a kid? A bunch of your friends piled on, weighing it down, and then chanted as you worked to get the thing moving. Getting started was slow going. The first step was always the hardest—getting it to move from a standstill. You had to push and pull, grimace and groan and throw your entire body into the effort. One step, two steps, three steps—it seemed like you were getting nowhere. After a long and hard effort, finally you were able to get up a little bit of speed and run alongside it. Even though you were moving (and your friends were cheering louder), to get the speed you really wanted, you had to keep running faster and faster, pulling it behind you as you ran with all your might. Finally, success! You jumped on and joined your friends in the joy of feeling the wind in your face and watching the outside world turn into a smear of colors. After a while, when the merry-go-round started to slow down, you’d hop off and run alongside for a minute to get the speed back up—or you could simply give it a couple good pushes and then hop back on. Once the merry-go-round was spinning at a good clip, momentum took over, making it easy to keep it going. Adopting any change is the same way. You get started by taking one small step, one action at a time. Progress is slow, but once a newly formed habit has kicked in, Big Mo joins the party. Your success and results compound rapidly. See Figure 8. Fig. 8 It takes time and energy to get Big Mo, but with it, success and results compound rapidly. The same thing happens when a rocket ship launches. The space shuttle uses more fuel during the first few minutes of its flight than it does the rest of the entire trip. Why? Because it has to break free from the pull of gravity. Once it does, it can glide in orbit. The hard part? Getting off the ground. Your old ways and your old conditioning are just like the inertia of the merry-go-round or the pull of gravity. Everything wants to stay at rest. You’ll need a lot of energy to break inertia and get your new enterprise under way. But once you get momentum, you will be hard to stop—virtually unbeatable—even though you’re now putting out considerably less effort while receiving greater results. Ever wonder why successful people tend to get more successful… the rich get richer… the happy get happier… the lucky get luckier? They’ve got Mo. When it rains, it pours. But momentum works on both sides of the equation—it can work for you or against you. Since the Compound Effect is always working, negative habits, when left unchecked, can build up steam and send you into a tailspin of “unlucky” circumstances and consequences. That’s what our friend Brad from Chapter 1 experienced. He gained thirty-three pounds with a few small bad habits, and experienced major job and marriage stress because of the negative momentum those habits generated. The law of inertia says objects at rest tend to stay at rest—that’s the Compound Effect working against you. The more time you spend sitting on that couch watching Netflix, the harder it will be for you to get up and get moving. So let’s start RIGHT NOW! How do you get Big Mo to pay you a visit? You build up to it. You get into the groove or the “zone,” by doing the things we’ve covered so far: 1) Making new choices based on your goals and core values 2) Putting those choices to work through new positive behaviors 3) Repeating those healthy actions long enough to establish new habits 4) Building routines and rhythms into your daily disciplines 5) Staying consistent over a long enough period of time Then, BANG! Big Mo kicks in your door (that’s a good thing)! And you’re virtually unstoppable. Think about swimmer Michael Phelps, who won a legendary 28 Olympic medals (23 of them gold!). How did he do it? Working with his coach, Bob Bowman, Phelps honed his talents over the course of twelve years. Together, they built routines and rhythms, and developed a consistency of performance that prepared Phelps to catch momentum just at the right time—the Olympic Games. Phelps and Bowman’s symbiotic relationship is legendary for its scope and ambition—and its utter predictability. Bowman required such consistency when it came to practice that one of Phelps’ most vivid memories is when Bowman allowed him to finish a training session 15 minutes early so he could get ready for a middle-school dance! That’s one time in twelve years! No wonder Phelps was so unbeatable in the pool! Chances are you have an iPod. Ever think about the evolution that made it possible for that little gizmo to become such a smashing success? Apple was around a long time before they launched the iPod. While Mac computers had an intensely loyal following, at the time they still comprised a small fraction of the overall PC market. The iPod certainly wasn’t the first MP3 player out there; Apple was actually late to the game. But they had something powerful going for them: the consistency of their efforts in maintaining customer loyalty, a steadfast commitment to high quality, innovative design, and ease of use. They made the MP3 player simple, cool, easy to use and play with, and promoted it through entertaining and inventive ad campaigns. It worked! It hit a nerve. But, the iPod wasn’t an overnight success. The year Apple released the iPod, they went from 30 percent revenue growth the year previous to -33 percent. The following year was also a negative revenue growth year at -2 percent. The second full year saw a shift to a positive 18 percent. Growth came again the next year, up to 33 percent. Finally, four years later, they caught Mo, and BANG! Apple catapulted to 68 percent revenue growth and went on to dominate more than 70 percent of the MP3 player market share. As you know, Big Mo has since helped them dominate the smartphone market (with the iPhone) and digital music distribution with iTunes. This momentum has also given them a resurgence of growth in their original market of personal computers. With Big Mo on their side, I wouldn’t be surprised to see them expand into other markets. Google was a small, struggling search engine for a while. Today it, too, owns more than 90 percent of its market. YouTube, the video-sharing space created in February 2005, officially launched in November of that year. But it wasn’t until they featured the “Lazy Sunday” digital short that originally aired on Saturday Night Live that people started going to YouTube in huge numbers to find it. That YouTube video clip went viral—it got more than 5 million views before NBC asked to have it taken down. Then, there was no way to catch them—they had Mo. Today YouTube is the second most popular social media platform and attracts over a third (37 percent) of all mobile internet traffic. Google caught up with YouTube’s two young founders and paid them 1.65 billion to buy their Mo. Wow! What do Michael Phelps, Apple, Google, and YouTube have in common? They were doing the same things before and after they achieved momentum. Their habits, disciplines, routines, and consistency were the keys that unlocked momentum for each. And they became unstoppable when Big Mo showed up to their party. Routine Power Some of our best intentions fail because we don’t have a system of execution. When it comes down to it, your new attitudes and behaviors must be incorporated into your monthly, weekly, and daily routines to effect any real, positive change. A routine is something you do every day without fail, so that eventually, like brushing your teeth or putting on your seatbelt, you do it without conscious thought. Similar to our discussion in the Habits section, if you look at anything you do that’s successful, you’ll see that you’ve probably developed a routine for it. These routines ease life’s stresses by making our actions automatic and effective. To reach new goals and develop new habits, it’s necessary to create new routines to support your objectives. The greater the challenge, the more rigorous our routines need to be. Ever wonder why military boot camp is so hard—where relatively minor tasks like making the bed, shining your shoes, or standing at attention become over-the-top important? Building routines to prep soldiers for combat is the most effective way to elicit efficient, productive, and reliable performance under intense pressure. The seemingly simplistic routines built and developed during basic training are so exact that soft, fearful, slovenly teenagers are transformed into lean, confident, mission-driven soldiers in only eight to twelve weeks. Their routines are so well rehearsed that these young soldiers can instinctively act with precision in the middle of the chaos of combat. That intense level of training and practice prepares soldiers to carry out their duties—even under the threat of imminent death. Now, your days might not be as dangerous, but without the proper routines built into your schedule, the results of your life can be unruly and unnecessarily hard. Developing a routine of predictable, daily disciplines prepares you to be victorious on the battlefield of life. Golfer Jack Nicklaus was famous for his pre-shot routine. He was religious about the “dance” he would do before every shot, a series of routine mental and physical steps that got him fully focused and ready for the shot. Jack would start out behind the ball and then pick out one or two intermediate spots between the ball and the target. As he walked around and approached the ball, the first thing he would do is line up his clubface to his intermediate target. He wouldn’t put his feet into position until he felt he had his clubface properly squared up. Then he would take his stance. From there, he would waggle the club and look out to his target, then back to his intermediate target and back to the golf club, with a repeat of the view. Then, and only then, would he strike the ball. During one of the important Majors, a psychologist timed Nicklaus from the moment he pulled the club out of the bag until the moment he hit the ball, and guess what? In each shot, from the first tee to the eighteenth green, the timing of Jack’s routine supposedly never varied more than one second. That is amazing! The same psychologist measured Greg Norman during his unfortunate collapse at the 1996 Masters. Lo and behold, his pre-shot routine got faster and faster as the round progressed. Varying his routine stunted his rhythm and consistency. He was never able to catch momentum. The moment Norman changed his routine, his performance became unpredictable and his results erratic. Football kickers likewise cherish their pre-kick routines, which allow them to get into sync with the thousands of times they have done this same action. Predictably, without a pre-kick routine, their performance under time pressure greatly diminishes. Pilots go through their preflight checklist. Even when a pilot has logged thousands of hours and the plane came in with a “perfect” performance review from a previous destination, the pilot goes through a preflight checklist every time without fail. This not only prepares the plane, but more importantly, centers the pilot and prepares him or her for the upcoming performance. Of all the high-achievers and business leaders I’ve worked with and observed, I’ve noticed not only do they have good habits, but each has developed consistent routines for carrying out their daily disciplines. It’s the only way any of us can predictably regulate our behavior. There simply isn’t any way around it. A daily routine built on good habits and disciplines separates the most successful among us from everyone else. A routine is exceptionally powerful. To create profitable and effective routines, you must first decide what behaviors and habits you want to implement. Take a moment to review your goals from Chapter 3, as well as the behaviors you want to add and subtract. Now it’s your turn to be Jack Nicklaus and figure out your best pre-shot routine. Be intentional about what components belong. Once you establish, say, a morning routine, I want you to consider it cast in concrete until further notice. You get up. You do it—no argument. If someone or something interrupts you, start back at the beginning to anchor your foundation for the performance that follows. Bookend Your Days The key to becoming world-class in your endeavors is to build your performance around world-class routines. It can be difficult, even futile, to predict or control what will show up in the middle of your workday. But you can almost always control how your day starts and ends. I have routines for both. I’ll share aspects of each here to give you some ideas and to help you better understand the power and importance of building your new behaviors into disciplined routines. Starting with my goals in mind, I designed my behaviors and routines accordingly. Perhaps as I share some of what works for me, you’ll identify strategies you’d like to try… Rise & Shine My morning routine is my Jack Nicklaus pre-shot preparation; it sets me up for the entire day. Because it happens every morning, it’s locked in and I don’t have to think about it. My iPhone alarm goes off at 5 a.m. (confession: sometimes, 5:30 a.m.) and I hit the Snooze button. Then I know I have eight minutes. During those eight minutes I do three things: First, I think about everything I’m grateful for. I know I need to attune my mind to abundance. The world looks, acts, and responds to you very differently when you start your day with a feeling and orientation of gratitude for that which you already have. Second, I do something that sounds a bit odd, but I send love to someone. The way to get love is to give it, and one thing I want more of is love. I give love by thinking of one person, anyone (it could be a friend, relative, co-worker, or someone I just met in the supermarket—it doesn’t matter), and then I send them love by imagining all that I wish and hope for them. Some would call this a blessing or a prayer. I call it a mental love letter. Third, I think about my No. 1 goal and decide what three things I’m going to do on this day to move closer toward reaching it. For example, at the time of this writing, my No. 1 goal is to deepen the love and intimacy in my marriage. Each morning I plan three things I can do to make sure that my wife feels loved, respected, and beautiful. When I get up, I put on a pot of coffee, and while it’s brewing, I do a series of stretches for about ten minutes—something I picked up from Dr. Oz. If you’ve lifted weights your whole life as I have, you get stiff. I realized the only way I was going to incorporate more stretching into my life was to make it a routine. I had to figure out where in my schedule I could stick it in—and while the coffee’s brewing is as good a time as any. Once I’ve stretched and poured my cup, I sit in my favorite chair and watch DarrenDaily (yes, I watch my own DarrenDaily!). Then I set my iPhone for thirty minutes (no more, no less), and read something positive and instructional. When the alarm sounds, I take my most important project and work on it for 90 minutes of completely focused and undistracted effort (notice I haven’t opened e-mail yet). Then, every morning at 7 a.m., I have what I call my calibration appointment, a recurring appointment set in my calendar, where I take fifteen minutes to calibrate my day. This is where I brush over my top three one-year and five-year goals, my key quarterly objectives, and my top goal for the week and month. Then, for the most important part of the calibration appointment, I review (or set) my top three MVPs (Most Valuable Priorities) for that day, asking myself, “If I only did three things today, what are the actions that will produce the greatest results in moving me closer to my big goals?” Then, and only then, do I open e-mail and send out a flurry of tasks and delegations to get the rest of my team started on their day. I then quickly close down my e-mail and go to work on my MVPs. The rest of the day can take a million different shapes, but as long as I go through my morning routine, a majority of the key disciplines I need to be practicing are taken care of, and I’m properly grounded and prepared to perform at a much higher level than if I started each day erratically—or worse, with a set of bad habits. Sweet Dreams In the evening I like to “cash out”—something I learned from waiting tables in my youth. Before we could go home, we had to cash out, meaning turn in all our receipts, credit card slips, and cash. Everything had to add up, or there was big trouble! It’s important to cash out your day’s performance. Compared to your plan for the day, how did it go? What do you need to carry over to tomorrow’s plan? What else needs to be added, based on what showed up throughout the day? What’s no longer important and needs to be scratched out? Additionally, I like to log any new ideas, ah-has or insights I picked up throughout the day in my journal—this is how I’ve collected more than forty journals of incredible ideas, insights, and strategies. Finally, I like to read at least ten pages of an inspirational book before going to sleep. I know the mind continues to process the last information consumed before bedtime, so I want to focus my attention on something constructive and helpful in making progress with my goals and ambitions. That’s it. All hell can break loose throughout the day, but because I control the bookends, I know I’m always going to start and finish strong. Shake It Up Every so often I like to interrupt my routines. Otherwise, life gets stale and I plateau. An easy example is working out with weights. When I work out the same way at the same time, doing the same repetitive movements week after week, my body stops showing compounded results. I get bored, lose my passion, and big Mo is a no-show. That’s why it’s important to mix it up, challenge yourself in new ways, and freshen up your experience! Right now I’m working on adding more adventure into my life. I set weekly, monthly, and yearly goals to do something I wouldn’t normally do. Most of the time it’s nothing earth-shattering, but things such as eating different kinds of foods, taking a class, visiting a new destination, or joining a club to meet new people. This change of pace makes me feel alive, helps recapture my passion, and offers me opportunities for fresh perspectives. Look at your routines. If something that used to energize you has become same-old/same-old or is no longer generating powerful results, switch it up. Getting into a Rhythm: Finding Your New Groove Once your daily disciplines have become a routine, you want the succession of those steps to create a rhythm. When your disciplines and actions jibe into a regular weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly rhythm, it’s like laying a welcome mat at the front door for Big Mo. It’s like the wheels of a steam locomotive. At a standstill, it takes very little to keep it from moving forward—a one-inch block of wood placed under the front wheel will do the job. It takes an incredible amount of steam to get the pistons to move and cause a series of connections that get the wheels to budge. It’s a slow process. But once the train starts rolling, the wheels get into a rhythm. If the pressure remains consistent, the train gains momentum, and watch out! At 55 miles an hour, that train can crash through a five-foot, steel-reinforced concrete wall and keep on going. Envisioning your success as an unstoppable locomotive may help you stay enthusiastic about getting into your own rhythm. See Figure 9. Fig. 9 When your disciplines and actions develop a rhythm, you welcome Big Mo. Along with my daily rhythms, I also plan ahead. For instance, in looking again at my goal of deepening the love and intimacy of my marriage, I designed a weekly, monthly, and quarterly rhythm schedule. Doesn’t sound too romantic, I know. But maybe you’ve noticed that, even when something’s a high priority for you, if it isn’t scheduled on your calendar, it often doesn’t happen, right? Certainly not with the regularity you’ll need to get into any kind of rhythm. Here’s how it works. Every Friday night is “date night.” Georgia and I go out or do something special together. At 6 p.m., an alarm goes off on both our iPhones, and no matter what we’re doing, date night is on! Every Saturday is FD (Family Day)—which means NO working. Essentially sundown on Friday night until sunup on Sunday morning is time we devote to the marriage and family. If you don’t create these boundaries, one day has a tendency to flow into the next. Unfortunately, the people who get shoved aside are often the most important. Every Sunday night, also at 6 p.m., we have our RR (Relationship Review). This is a practice I picked up from relationship experts Linda and Richard Eyre. During this time, we discuss the previous week’s wins, losses, as well as the adjustments we need to make in our relationship. We start the conversation by telling each other a few things we have appreciated about the other during the previous week—it’s helpful to start with the good stuff. Then, using an idea I picked up from my friend Jack Canfield, we ask each other, “On a scale of one to ten (ten being the best), how would you rate our relationship this week?” This gets the discussion of wins and losses flowing—oh, boy! Then we discuss the adjustments that need to be made through this follow-up question: “What would it take to make your experience a ten?” By the end of the discussion, both of us feel heard and validated, and we have made our observations and wishes clear moving into the next week. This is an incredible process. I highly recommend it… if you dare! Every month, Georgia and I also schedule something unique and memorable. Jim Rohn taught me that life is simply a collection of experiences. Our goal should be to increase the frequency and the intensity of the good experiences. Once a month we try to do something that creates an experience that has some memorable intensity. It could be driving up to the mountains, going on an adventurous hike, trying a new fancy restaurant, going sailing in the bay—whatever. Something out of the ordinary that has a heightened experience and creates an indelible memory. Once a quarter, we plan a two- to three-day getaway. I like to do a quarterly review of all my goals and life patterns. This is a great time to do a deeper check-in on how things are going in our relationship. Then we have our special travel vacation, plus our holiday traditions and our New Year’s hike and goal-setting ritual. You can see that once all this is scheduled, you no longer have to think about what you need to be doing. Everything happens naturally. We’ve created a rhythm that gives us momentum. Registering Your Rhythm I want to share with you something I created for myself that helps me keep track of the rhythm of a new behavior. I call it my “Rhythm Register,” and I think you’ll find it extremely helpful. Remember from earlier in this book the importance of tracking. If you want to drink more water, take more steps each day, or acknowledge your spouse more affectionately—whatever behavior you’ve decided you need to move toward your goal—you’ll want to track it to make sure you’re establishing a rhythm. See Figure 10. Fig. 10 You can download a copy of the weekly rhythm register at TheCompoundEffect.com/Resources. This is also a part of the Living Your Best Year Ever journal as well (LivingYourBestYearEver.com). The Rhythms of Life When people get started in a new endeavor, they almost always overdo it. Of course, I want you to feel excited about setting up a rhythm for success, but you need to find a program that you can absolutely, positively do in the long term without renegotiation. I don’t want you thinking of the rhythms you can do for this week, month, or even the next ninety days. I want you to think about what you can do for the rest of your life. The Compound Effect—the positive results you want to experience in your life—will be the result of smart choices (and actions) repeated consistently over time. You win when you take the right steps day in and day out. But you set yourself up for failure by doing too much too soon. A friend (who will remain unnamed to protect the guilty) decided he was going to get in shape after seeing a picture of himself posted on social media. This was a massive lifestyle shift for him. On the job, he sits for at least a dozen hours a day and he hates to exercise. Previously, he explained that he would find ways of avoiding using certain dishes or accessing files if it required him to squat and bend down to get them—that’s how much of an aversion he had to physical activity. Still, he made a resolution to get in shape. He joined a gym, hired a personal trainer, and began working out two hours a day, five days a week. “Richard [let’s call him],” I said, “that’s a mistake. You will not be able to maintain that commitment and will eventually stop doing it. You’re setting yourself up for failure.” He pushed back, assuring me that he’d changed forever. Even his trainer had recommended the intense push. “I’m committed,” he said. “I want to be able to see my abs.” “Richard, what’s your real goal?” I asked him. I knew he wasn’t gunning to be on the cover of Men’s Fitness. “I want to be trim. I want to be healthy,” he told me. “Why?” I asked. “I want vitality. I want to be here long enough to see my kids have kids,” he replied. These were his real, meaningful motivations. Richard wanted to be in it for the long haul. That meant he was signing on not for bikini season, but a long-term commitment to fitness. “Okay,” I said. “You’ve convinced me. But you’re overdoing it. You’re going to get two or three months down the road and you’re going to say, ‘I don’t have two hours to work out, so I guess I can’t do it today.’ That’s going to happen to you over and over again. Working out five days a week will turn into two or three, and you’ll get discouraged. Soon it will be over. I know you’re really fired up right now, so let’s do this: do your two hours a day, five days a week, for now [takes a lot of steam to get the wheels to budge from the inertia], but don’t do it longer than sixty or ninety days. Then, I want you to scale it down to an hour or an hour and fifteen. You can still do your five days a week, but I would probably encourage you to go four. Do that another sixty to ninety days. Then I want you to consider an hour a day for a minimum of three days a week, four if you’re feeling extra spry. That’s the program I want you to work toward, because if you don’t get into something you can maintain, you won’t do it at all.” I really had to struggle to get Richard to comprehend this because, at that moment, he was all gung-ho. He thought he was going to be able to stick with his new routine for a lifetime. For someone who never worked out to start working out two hours a day, five days a week, is a surefire dead end. You have to build a program that you can do for fifty years, not five weeks or five months. It’s okay if you go strong for a while, but you’ve got to see light at the end of the tunnel where you can start scaling it back. You can always find forty-five minutes to an hour a few times a week, but to find two hours, five days a week, to make your routine work, that’ll never happen. Remember, consistency is a critical component of success. The Power of Consistency I’ve mentioned that if there’s one discipline that gives me a competitive advantage, it’s my ability to be consistent. Nothing kills Big Mo quicker and with more certainty than a lack of consistency. Even good, passionate, and ambitious people with good intentions can fall short when it comes to consistency. But it’s a powerful tool you can use to launch the flight toward your goals. Think of it like this: If you and I flew planes from Los Angeles to Manhattan, but you took off and landed in every state in between, while I flew straight through, even if you went five hundred miles per hour in the air and I only traveled at a rate of two hundred miles per hour, I’d still beat you by a big margin. The time and energy it takes for you to repeatedly stop and start and get back to momentum would make your trip at least ten times as long. In fact, more than likely you wouldn’t even make it—you’d run out of fuel (energy, motivation, belief, will) at some point. It’s far easier and requires a lot less energy to take off once and maintain a regular speed (even if slower than most everyone else) all along the way. The Pump Well When you start thinking about slacking off on your routines and rhythms, consider the massive cost of inconsistency. It is not the loss of the single action and tiny results it creates. It is the utter collapse and loss of momentum your entire progress will suffer. Think of a hand-pumped water well, which uses a pipe to draw water up from the water table several feet underground. To get the water to the surface, you have to pump the well’s lever to create the suction that brings the water above the ground and out of the spout. See Figure 11. Fig. 11 Consistency is the key to achieving and maintaining momentum. When most people start a new endeavor, they grab the lever and start pumping really hard. Just as Richard was with his plan to get fit, they’re excited and committed… They pump and pump and pump, but after a few minutes (or a few weeks), when they don’t see any water (results), they give up pumping the lever altogether. They don’t realize how long it takes to create the vacuum needed to suck the water into the pipe and eventually out of the spout and into their bucket. Just like the merry-go-round, rocket ship, or steam engine breaking free of inertia, it takes time, massive energy, and consistency to pump water. Most people give up, but wise people continue to pump. Those who persevere and continue to pump the lever will eventually get a few drops of water. This is when a lot of people say, “You’ve got to be kidding me! All this pumping, and for what—a few measly drops? Forget it!” Many people throw their hands up in defeat and quit, but wise people persist further. And here’s where the magic happens: If you continue to pump, it doesn’t take long before you’ll get a full and steady stream of water. You have success! Now that the water is flowing, you no longer need to pump the lever as hard or as quickly. It becomes easy, actually. All you have to do to keep the pressure steady is to keep pumping the lever consistently. That’s the Compound Effect. Now, what happens if you let go of the lever for too long? The water falls back down into the ground and you’re back to square one. If you try to pump the lever easily and steadily, you won’t get any water. Mo is gone. The water is back at the bottom. The only way to get it back up again is to pump it really hard all over. That’s how most of us lead our lives, in fits and starts. We get a new business venture going and then cut out on vacation. We start up a routine of making ten prospecting calls a day, strike a little gold, and then shift into neutral. We get hopped up about our new “date night” routine with our spouse, but in a few weeks, it’s back to Netflix and microwave popcorn on the couch Friday nights. I see people buy a new book, sign up for a new program or seminar, and go like crazy for a couple of weeks or months. Then they stop and end up right back where they started. (Sound familiar?) Miss only a couple weeks of anything—workouts at the gym, affectionate gestures toward your spouse, or the phone calls that are part of your prospecting routine—and you don’t simply lose the results those two weeks would have produced. If that’s all you lost (which is what most people assume), not much damage would be done. But by slacking off, for even a short time, you killed Mo. It’s dead. And that’s a tragedy. Winning the race is all about pace. Be the tortoise. The person who, given enough time, will beat virtually anybody in any competition as a result of positive habits and behaviors applied consistently. That’ll put the mojo in your momentum. And keep it there! Making the right choice, holding to right behaviors, practicing perfect habits, staying consistent, and keeping your momentum is easier said than done, especially in the dynamic, constantly changing, and always challenging world we share with billions of other people. In the next chapter, I will discuss the many influences that (mostly unknowingly) can help or hinder your ability to succeed. These influences are pervasive, persuasive, and constant. Learn how to use them or you might end up losing because of them. Let me show you how…","output":"The text appears to be from a book chapter discussing the concept of \\"Momentum\\" or \\"Big Mo,\\" referring to the positive force that propels individuals towards success. Here's a summary of the key lessons from the chapter: 1. **The Power of Momentum**: Momentum, likened to Newton's First Law of motion, can have a huge impact on one's success. It's difficult to get started, but once momentum is gained, it becomes a powerful force that can lead to rapid achievements. 2. **Building Momentum**: The chapter advises starting with small steps and consistently building upon them. Like pushing a merry-go-round, the initial effort is immense, but once it's moving, it takes much less effort to maintain the momentum. 3. **Routine and Rhythm**: Establishing daily routines helps prepare you for success in the same way basic training prepares soldiers. A predictable routine turns necessary actions into automatic behaviors. 4. **Consistent Daily Disciplines**: By incorporating disciplined routines tailored to your goals into your daily life, you increase your chances of success. This includes prioritizing your tasks and incorporating beneficial behaviors into your morning and evening routines. 5. **Adjusting Routines**: While routines are essential, it's also important to occasionally switch them up to prevent boredom and plateauing. Introducing new challenges or activities can revitalize your momentum. 6. **Long-term Sustainability**: When adopting new routines or habits, you must ensure they are sustainable in the long term. Make sure they are manageable and can be integrated into your life permanently. 7. **The Importance of Tracking**: To make sure you're establishing a rhythm with your new behaviors, it’s helpful to track them using tools like the \\"Rhythm Register.\\" 8. **The Importance of Consistency**: Inconsistency can kill momentum. Consistency in action is like continuously pumping a well; if you stop, you'll lose the progress and have to start over. 9. **Bookending Your Days**: Control over the start and end of your day can set the tone for everything in between. Design morning and evening routines that align with your life goals and values to maintain consistency. In summary, the chapter emphasizes the significance of building and maintaining momentum through consistent actions, creating and adhering to routines, and being mindful of the long-term viability of your behaviors. It also highlights the role of tracking progress and the dangers of inconsistency. Successful people, exemplified by the likes of Michael Phelps and companies like Apple and Google, have achieved their momentum through persistence, discipline, and sticking to their well-established routines until success compounds and becomes unstoppable."},{"instruction":"more","output":"Continuing from the previous summary, here are additional lessons and insights from the chapter on Momentum: 10. **The Power of Small Actions**: The chapter encourages us to not underestimate the power of small, consistent actions over time. It's the small steps that lead to big changes, similar to the compounding effect of interest in finance. 11. **The Role of Habits in Momentum**: Developing new habits is critical for building momentum. The chapter suggests focusing on making new, better choices that align with your goals, repeating healthy actions until they become habits, and embedding them into your daily life. 12. **Using Routines to Reinforce Habits**: Routines serve as a framework that reinforces habits. By performing certain actions regularly, they become ingrained, allowing you to operate with a high degree of effectiveness and efficiency. 13. **Dealing with Disruptions**: The chapter acknowledges that life is unpredictable, and there will be disruptions to your routines. It advises having a robust enough routine that can withstand occasional disruptions without completely falling apart. 14. **Transforming Intention into Action**: The chapter stresses the importance of not just setting goals but also taking consistent action to achieve them. Routines are the bridge between intention and action. 15. **The Role of a Support System**: It's implied that surrounding oneself with people who support your goals and routines can make it easier to maintain momentum. 16. **Making Adjustments and Reviews**: Regularly reviewing and adjusting your goals and routines can help maintain momentum. In the chapter, the author mentions a \\"Relationship Review\\" ritual, which serves to keep his marriage strong and ensure continuous improvement. 17. **Visualizing Success and Momentum**: Visualizing your progress as an unstoppable force, like a locomotive, can help stay motivated and on track. 18. **Seasons of Intensity**: There are times when you may need to increase the intensity of your efforts to overcome inertia or to achieve a specific goal. This could be similar to an athlete training for an important competition but then returning to a less intense maintenance routine. In essence, the chapter weaves together strategies for harnessing the power of momentum through careful, consistent, and deliberate actions. It emphasizes that while building momentum might be challenging, the rewards are well worth the effort. By thoughtfully crafting routines, sticking to them, and allowing the Compound Effect to work in your favor, you set yourself up for a trajectory of success that becomes easier to maintain over time. The key takeaway is that momentum is a force that, once achieved, can carry you to heights of accomplishment that might otherwise seem out of reach."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Чтобы реализовать функционал, при котором достигнув конечного значения (например, в настройках разрешения экрана), пользователь не мог продолжать листать, вы можете следовать следующим шагам: 1. Определите переменные для хранения текущего значения (например, индекса текущего выбранного разрешения экрана) и конечного значения (максимально возможный индекс). 2. Создайте функцию, которая будет вызываться при попытке \\"листания\\". В этой функции проверьте, не достигнуто ли конечное значение. 3. Если текущее значение меньше конечного, разрешите \\"листание\\". Если же текущее значение равно конечному, блокируйте дальнейший ввод, который бы привел к листанию вперед. Ниже пример такого кода на языке Blueprint: 1. Сначала добавьте две переменные в Blueprint: - \`CurrentIndex\` для отслеживания текущего выбранного индекса. - \`MaxIndex\` для хранения максимально допустимого индекса. 2. В вашем Event Graph создайте логику для кнопок \\"Влево\\" и \\"Вправо\\": - Для кнопки \\"Влево\\": передайте логику, которая уменьшает \`CurrentIndex\` на 1, но только если \`CurrentIndex > 0\`. - Для кнопки \\"Вправо\\": передайте логику, которая увеличивает \`CurrentIndex\` на 1, но только если \`CurrentIndex < MaxIndex\`. 3. Пример такой логики для кнопки \\"Вправо\\" может выглядеть примерно так: \`\`\` + [При нажатии кнопки Вправо] | V Branch (с уcловием: CurrentIndex < MaxIndex) | True | False | | Inc (CurrentIndex) [ничего не делать] | Set (CurrentIndex) \`\`\` Подобная схема псевдокода в Blueprint определяет, что при нажатии кнопки \\"Вправо\\" происходит проверка: если текущий индекс меньше максимального, значение индекса увеличится. В противном случае ничего не произойдет, что и создаст эффект невозможности \\"листать\\" дальше. Для отображения текущего значения на UI вы можете использовать привязку (Binding) к тексту в Виджете UMG. Так, если у вас есть Text Widget, который показывает текущее разрешение экрана, вы можете привязать его к переменной \`CurrentIndex\` и адекватно отображать текущее разрешение. При работе с C++ подход будет похожим: вам нужно будет реализовать методы, которые реагируют на ввод пользователя и обновляют состояние только при условии, что не достигнут предельный индекс. Этот подход может быть дополнен и другой логикой в зависимости от конкретных требований проекта, включая анимацию, звуки, и так далее, чтобы улучшить отклик пользовательского интерфейса."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Even those that seem insignificant, when compounded, can make an extreme impact on your life. We’ve also discussed the fact that you are 100 percent responsible for your life. You alone are responsible for the choices you make and the actions you take. That said, you must also realize your choices, behaviors, and habits are influenced by very powerful external forces. Most of us aren’t aware of the subtle control these forces have on our lives. For you to sustain a positive trajectory toward your goals, you’ll need to understand and govern these influences. This is to ensure they support rather than derail your journey toward success. Everyone is affected by three kinds of influences: input (what you feed your mind), associations (the people you spend time with), and environment (your surroundings). I. Input: Garbage In, Garbage Out If you want your body to run at peak performance, you have to be vigilant about consuming the highest-quality nutrients and avoiding tempting junk food. If you want your brain to perform at its peak, you have to be even more vigilant about what you feed it. Are you feeding it constantly with negative news or mind-numbing TV shows? Are you stuffing your head full of BuzzFeed gossip, inane social media, or TikTok videos? The input you ingest has a direct and measurable impact on your productivity and outcomes. Keeping control over what our brains consume is especially difficult because so much of what we take in is unconscious. Although it’s true that we can eat without thinking, it’s easier to pay attention to what we put in our bodies because food doesn’t leap into our mouths. We need an extra layer of vigilance to prevent our brains from absorbing irrelevant, counterproductive or downright destructive input. It’s a never-ending battle to be selective and to stand guard against any information that can derail your creative potential. It’s important to understand that your brain is not designed to make you happy. Your brain has only one agenda in mind: survival. It is always watching for signs of “lack and attack.” Your brain is programmed to seek out the negative—dwindling resources, destructive weather, potential threat—whatever’s out to hurt you. So when you open up those news alerts on your phone in the morning and get bombarded with all those reports about robberies, fires, attacks, and the tanking economy, your brain lights up. Your brain will now spend all day chewing over that feast of fear, worry, negativity. Same deal when you scroll through updates in the evening. More bad news? Perfect! Your mind will stew on that all night long. Left to its own devices, your mind will traffic in the negative, worrisome, and fearful all day and night. We can’t change our DNA, but we can change our behavior. We can teach our minds to look beyond “lack and attack.” How? We can protect and feed our minds. We can be disciplined and proactive about what we allow in. I know it’s difficult to find a consistent, positive, and abundant-minded source input to start each day. It is why I created DarrenDaily. I write, record, and deliver a 5-minute mentoring video every weekday, specially designed to kick-start your morning and help you become #BetterEveryDay (DarrenDaily.com). DOWNLOAD THE INFLUENCES ASSESSMENT WORKSHEET AT THECOMPOUNDEFFECT.COM/RESOURCES Don’t Drink Dirty Water You get in life what you create. Expectation drives the creative process. What do you expect? You expect whatever it is you’re thinking about. Your thought process, the conversation in your head, is at the base of the results you create in life. So the question is, What are you thinking about? What is influencing and directing your thoughts? The answer: whatever you’re allowing yourself to hear and see. This is the input you are feeding your brain. Period. See Figure 12. Your mind is like an empty glass. It will hold anything you put into it. You put in sensational news, salacious headlines, talk-show rants, and you’re pouring dirty water into your glass. If you’ve got dark, dismal, worrisome water in your glass, everything you create will be filtered through that muddy mess, because that’s what you’ll be thinking about. Garbage in, garbage out. All that drive-time radio yak about murders, conspiracy, deaths, economy, and political battles drives your thinking process, which drives your expectations, which drives your creative output. That IS bad news. But just like a dirty glass, if you flush it with clean, clear water under the faucet long enough, eventually you’ll end up with a glass of pure, clear water. What is that clear water? Positive, inspirational, and supportive input and ideas. Stories of aspiration, people who, despite challenges, are overcoming obstacles and achieving great things. Strategies of success, prosperity, health, love, and joy. Ideas to create more abundance, to grow, expand, and become more. That is why I work so hard to deliver DarrenDaily each workday. I want to provide you with those examples and stories and the key takeaways you can use to improve your view of the world, yourself, and the results you create. That’s also why I read something inspirational and instructional for thirty minutes in the morning and evening, and have personal-development podcasts playing in my car, while I work out, walk the dog, and do chores. I’m flushing my glass and feeding my mind. Does this give me an edge over the guy who gets up and reads the newspaper first thing, listens to news radio on his commute to and from work, and watches or scrolls through the evening news before going to bed? You bet it does! And it can for you, too. Fig. 12 Flush out the negative (dirty water) with positive, inspirational, and supportive ideas (clean water). Step 1: Stand Guard Unless you decide to hole up in a cave or on a desert island, you’re going to get dirty water in your glass. It’s going to be on billboards, on CNN while you’re walking through the airport, on the screaming tabloid headlines at the checkout when you’re buying groceries, etc. Even friends, family members, and your own negative mental tapes can flood dirty water into your glass. But that doesn’t mean you can’t take steps to limit your exposure to all that grime. Maybe you can’t avoid the negative posts when you go on social media, but you can limit the amount of time you are logged on. You can refuse to listen to the radio to and from work and instead put on an instructional and inspirational audiobook or podcast. You can put down your phone and talk to your loved ones instead. You can press play on those show recommendations you feel are truly educational and life-affirming—and speed through the commercials aimed at making you feel inadequate or lacking unless you buy more crap. I didn’t really grow up with TV. I remember watching Solid Gold and The A-Team (remember them?), but television wasn’t a big part of our family life. I managed somehow to thrive without it, and that’s given me a clearer perspective when I watch an occasional program now. Sure, I’ll laugh along with the sitcom, but afterward, I feel the same as if I ate fast food—bloated and malnourished. And I can’t get over how commercials prey on our psychology, our fears, pains, needs, and weaknesses. If I walk through life thinking that I’m not enough just as I am—that I need to buy this, that, and the other thing to be okay—how can I expect to create amazing results? It’s estimated that Americans (twelve and older) spend 1,704 hours watching TV per year. That averages out to 4.7 HOURS per day. We’re spending almost 30 percent of our waking hours watching TV. Almost thirty-three hours per week—more than one whole day each week! It’s the equivalent of watching TV for two solid months out of every twelve! WOW! And people wonder why they can’t get ahead in life? Put Yourself on a Media Diet The media thrives on taking us hostage. Ever been stuck on the freeway with traffic backed up for miles, making you late, wondering what the heck’s holding everything up? Sure enough, when you finally get close, you see that nothing physical is blocking the flow of cars. The wreck clearly happened a while ago and has since been moved to the side of the freeway. The 3-mph crawl was caused by people rubbernecking! Now you’re really irritated. But what happens when your car passes the wreck? You slow way down, take your eyes off the road in front of you, and crane your own neck! Why do good, decent people want to see something tragic and grotesque? It’s our genetic heritage, going back to our prehistoric sense of self-preservation. We can’t help ourselves. Even if we’re adept at avoiding negativity, and have trained ourselves to be relentlessly positive, when it comes to sensationalism, our basic nature can’t resist. Media masters understand that. They know your nature, in many ways better than you. The media has always used shocking and sensational headlines to draw attention. But today, instead of three news TV and radio networks, there are hundreds, running 24/7. Instead of a few newspapers, there are endless portals reaching us from our computers to our phones. The competition for your attention has never been bloodier, and the media jockeys continually up the ante in shock value. They find a dozen or so of the most heinous, scandalous, criminal, murderous, bleak, and horrid things that happen in the world each day, and parade them through our papers, news channels, and the Web over and over. Plus, nowadays, anyone with a social media handle can choose to share, spread, and pass on negative stories with a quick click of a button. Meanwhile, during that same twenty-four-hour period, millions of wonderful, beautiful, incredible things have happened. Yet we hear very little about them. Being wired to seek out the negative, we create the demand for more and more. How could the positive news stories ever hope to compete with those ratings, shares, or advertising dollars? Let’s go back to our freeway. Instead of a wreck on the side of the road, what if there was the most stunning, miraculous sunset you’ve ever seen? What would happen to the traffic then? I’ve seen this many times. It whizzes by at top speed. The great danger of the media is that it gives us a very perverted view of the world. Because the focus and the repetition of messaging is on the negative, that’s what our minds start believing. This warped and narrow view of what’s not working has a severe influence on your creative potential. It can be crippling. My Personal Junk Filter I’ll share what I do to safeguard my mind. But I warn you, I have a rigorous mental diet. You’ll want to adjust to your own preferences, but this system has worked beautifully for me. As you might guess, I don’t watch or listen to any news and I don’t read any news feeds or news publications. Ninety-nine percent of all news has no bearing on my personal life or my personal goals, dreams, and ambitions anyway. I have set up a few RSS feeds identifying the news and industry updates that do pertain to my direct interests and goals. The news that’s helpful to me gets plucked out of the fray so I don’t have to get any mud slung into my glass of water. While most people wade through hours of irrelevant garbage that hampers their thinking and crushes their spirit, I get the most productive information I need when I need it, in less than fifteen minutes a day. Step 2: Enroll in Drive-Time U It’s not enough to eliminate negative input. To move in a positive direction, you must flush out the bad and fill up on the good. My car won’t move without two things: gasoline and an ever-present library of instructional podcasts and audiobooks I listen to as I drive. The average American drives about twelve thousand miles a year. That’s three hundred hours of flushing potential right there! Brian Tracy taught me the concept of turning my car into a mobile classroom. He explained to me that by listening to instructional material as I drive, I gain knowledge equivalent to two semesters of an advanced college degree—every year. Think about it. Using the time you’re currently wasting by listening to drive-time radio, you could obtain the equivalent of a Ph.D. in leadership, sales success, wealth building, relationship excellence—or whatever course you choose. This commitment, in combination with your reading routine, separates you from the herd of average—one podcast or book at a time. By the way, if you want a podcast that will give you that positive input you’re looking for, check out DarrenDaily On-Demand wherever you listen to your podcast episodes, or go to DarrenDailyOnDemand.com. I listen to every episode! Not joking. II. Associations: Who’s Influencing You? Birds of a feather flock together. The people with whom you habitually associate are called your “reference group.” According to research by social psychologist Dr. David McClelland of Harvard, your “reference group” determines as much as 95 percent of your success or failure in life. Who do you spend the most time with? Who are the people you most admire? Are those two groups of people exactly the same? If not, why not? Jim Rohn taught that we become the combined average of the five people we hang around the most. Rohn would say we could tell the quality of our health, attitude, and income by looking at the people around us. The people with whom we spend our time determine what conversations dominate our attention, along with the attitudes and opinions we are regularly exposed to. Eventually, we start to eat what they eat, talk like they talk, read what they read, think like they think, watch what they watch, treat people how they treat them, even dress like they dress. The funny thing is, more often than not, we are completely unaware of the similarities between us and our circle of five. How are we not aware? Because your associations don’t shove you in a direction; they nudge you ever so slightly over time. Their influence is so subtle that it’s like being on an inner tube out in the ocean, feeling like you’re floating in place. That is, until you look up and realize the gentle current has pushed you a half-mile down the shore. Think of your friends who order greasy appetizers or a cocktail before dinner, and that’s their routine. Hang out with them enough, and you’ll find yourself grabbing for cheese nachos and potato skins, and joining them for that extra beer or glass of wine. Your pace will suddenly match their pace. Meanwhile, your other friends order healthy food and talk about the inspiring books they’re reading, their new goals, and business aspirations. Soon you begin to assimilate their behaviors and habits. You read and talk about what they talk about. You see the movies they’re excited about and you go to the places they recommend. The influence your friends have over you is subtle and can be positive or negative. Either way, the impact is incredibly powerful. Watch out! You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. So, what is the combined average income, health, or attitudes of the five people you spend most of your time with? Does the answer frighten you? If so, the best way to increase the potential for whatever traits you desire is to spend the majority of your time with people who already possess those traits. You will then see the power of influence work for you, rather than against you. The behaviors and attitudes that helped them acquire the success you admire will begin to become part of your daily routine. Hang around them long enough and you’re likely to realize similar successful outcomes in your life. If you haven’t already, jot down the names of those five people you hang around the most. Also write down their main characteristics, both positive and negative. It doesn’t matter who they are. It could be your spouse, your brother, your neighbor, or your assistant. Now, average them out. What’s their average health and bank balance? What’s their average relationship like? As you look at the results, ask yourself, “Is this list okay for me? Is this where I want to go?” It’s time to reappraise and reprioritize the people you spend time with. These relationships can nurture you, starve you, or keep you stuck. Now that you’ve started to carefully consider who you spend your time with, let’s go a little deeper. As Jim Rohn taught me, it’s powerful to evaluate and shift your associations into three categories: dissociations, limited associations, and expanded associations. DOWNLOAD THE ASSOCIATION EVALUATOR WORKSHEET BY VISITING THECOMPOUNDEFFECT.COM/RESOURCES Dissociations You guard against the influences your children are exposed to and the people they hang around. You are aware of the influence these people could have on your children and the choices they might make as a result. I believe this same principle should apply to you! You already know this: There are some people you might need to break away from. Completely. This might not be an easy step to take, but it’s essential. You have to make the hard choice not to let certain negative influences affect you anymore. Determine the quality of life you want to have and then surround yourself with the people who represent and support that vision. I’m constantly weeding out people who refuse to grow and live positively. Growing and changing your associations is a lifelong process. Some people might say I’m too rigorous about it, but I’d like to be more so. I had a business relationship with someone I really liked, but when the economy got difficult, most of his conversation was focused on how horrible everything was, how much his company was feeling the hit, and how hard it was out there. I said, “Man, you’ve got to stop working on your presentation about how bad life is. I can hear you collecting all the data points to reinforce your beliefs.” He persisted in seeing everything as more dour and hopeless than it was. I decided we had no business doing business together. When you make the tough decision to put up boundaries between you and people who drag you down, realize that they’ll fight you—especially those closest to you. Your decision to live a more positive, goal-oriented life will hold a mirror up to their own poor choices. You will make them uncomfortable and they will attempt to pull you back down to their level. Their resistance doesn’t mean they don’t love you or want the best for you—it’s actually not about you at all. It’s about their fear and guilt about their own poor choices and lack of discipline. Just know that breaking away won’t be easy. Limited Associations There are some people you can spend three hours with, but not three days. Others you can spend three minutes with, but not three hours. Always remember that the influence of associations is both powerful and subtle. The person you’re walking with can determine whether you slow your pace or quicken it, literally and figuratively. Similarly, you can’t help but be touched by the dominant attitudes, actions, and behaviors of the people with whom you spend time. Decide how much you can “afford” to be influenced, based on how those people represent themselves. This is difficult, I know. I have had to do this on several occasions, even with close family members. I WILL NOT, however, allow someone else’s actions or attitudes to have a dampening influence on me. I once had a neighbor who was deemed a three-minute friend. For three minutes, we could have a great chit-chat, but we wouldn’t mesh for three hours. I can hang out with an old high-school friend for three hours, but he’s not a three-day guy. And, then there are some people I can hang around for a few days, but wouldn’t go on an extended vacation with. Take a look at your relationships. Make sure you’re not spending three hours with a three-minute person. Expanded Associations We’ve just talked about weeding out negative influencers. While you’re doing that, you’ll also want to reach out. Identify people who have positive qualities in the areas of life where you want to improve—people with the financial and business success you desire, the parenting skills you want, the relationships you yearn for, the lifestyle you love. And then spend more time with them. Join organizations, businesses, and health clubs where these people gather and make friends. Ahead, you’ll see how I even used to drive to a different town to spend quality time—with fortuitous results. I rave about Jim Rohn throughout this book. Aside from my father, Jim remains my foremost mentor and influencer. My relationship with Jim perfectly exemplifies an expanded association. While I got to share a few private meals and spend a little time with him during our interviews and backstage before events, most of my time with Jim was spent listening to him in my car or reading his words in my living room. I have spent more than a thousand hours getting direct instruction from Jim, and 99 percent of that was through books and audio programs. What’s exciting about that is, no matter where you are in your life—maybe busy at home with small children or caretaking aging parents, working long hours with people with whom you have little in common, or living out in the country far from the nearest office building—you, too, can have almost any mentor you want, if he or she has gathered their best thoughts, stories, and ideas into books, videos, and podcasts. You have an unlimited bounty from which to draw. Take advantage of it. Now people often reach out to my assistant in order to get my advice or mentorship. All she has to do is tell them it’s all already available from anywhere in the world through DarrenDaily or inside our Darren Hardy Training Vault. If you want to have a better, deeper, more meaningful relationship, ask yourself, “Who has the type of relationship I want? How can I spend (more) time with that person? Who can I meet who can positively influence me?” Let their glow rub off on you. Befriend the person you think is the biggest, baddest, most successful person in your field. What do they read? Where do they go for lunch? How can that association influence you? You can build these expanded associations by joining networking groups and even online communities. Find the charity organizations, symphonies, and clubs where the people you want to emulate gather. Find a Peak-Performance Partner Another way to increase your exposure to expanded associations is by teaming up with a peak performance partner, someone equally committed to study and personal growth as you. This person should be someone you trust, someone bold enough to tell you what they really think about you, your attitudes, and your performance. It could be that this person is a longtime friend, or it may be someone who doesn’t know you well at all. The point is to get (and give) an unbiased, honest, outside perspective. My longtime “accountability partner” is my good friend Landon Taylor. As I mentioned before, we have a thirty-minute call every Friday to discuss our weekly wins, losses, fixes, “ah-has,” and where we are on our growth plans. The anticipation of the call and knowing I have to be accountable to Landon keeps me extra committed throughout the week. I make a record of Landon’s losses or any feedback he needs and make sure to ask him about it the next week. He does the same for me. That way we hold each other accountable. He might say, “Okay, you screwed up here last week and admitted it and committed to change. What did you do about that this week?” Life is life. We’re both busy executives, but it’s amazing to me that we actually end up doing this every week without fail. It’s not easy. Sometimes I’ll be flying through my day and think, “Oh, crud! I have to do this.” But often in the middle of the call, I’ll think, “I’m so glad we’re having this conversation!” Even in preparing for it, and thinking of my big wins and losses for the week, I learn about myself. This week I told Landon, “You know, I’m in the middle of so many things. I’m writing my book. I’m having a lot of realizations, and so many ah-has, but not one thing that’s really compelling.” He said, “Let this be the last week that you don’t come to the table with an ah-ha.” Gulp. “Don’t shortchange me,” he said. Point taken. In reality, I was shortchanging myself by not identifying one thing memorable enough to share. I have a serious challenge for you if you’re up for it. Want real feedback? Find people who care enough about you to be brutally honest with you. Ask them these questions: “How do I show up to you? What do you think my strengths are? In what areas do you think I can improve? Where do you think I sabotage myself? What’s one thing I can stop doing that would benefit me the most? What’s the one thing I should start doing?” Invest in Mentorship Paul J. Meyer is another man who served as a mentor to me. Paul passed away in 2009 at age eighty-one. Whenever I thought I was really doing well, really playing at a high level, I’d get around Paul—he was my reality check. What he did before lunch was mind-boggling to me. I got to spend a lot of time with him. Paul bought one of my companies and I also conducted a turnaround for one of his companies. He was a very powerful spirit in my life. After spending a couple of hours with Paul, hearing about all his plans, ventures, and activities, my head would spin. Just trying to make sense of all he had going on exhausted me. After time with Paul, I’d want to go take a nap! But my association with him raised my game. His walking pace was my running pace. It expanded my ideas about how big I could play and how ambitious I could be. You have to get around people like that! You’re never too good for a mentor. My friend Harvey Mackay told me, “I have had twenty coaches, if you can believe it. I have a speech coach, I have a writing coach, I have a humor coach, I’ve got a language coach, and on and on.” I have always found it interesting that the most successful people, the truly top performers, are the ones willing to hire and pay for the best coaches and trainers there are. It pays to invest in your improved performance. Finding and engaging a mentor doesn’t need to be a mysterious or intimidating process either. When I sat down with Ken Blanchard, he explained the simplicity of engaging a mentor: “The first thing you want to remember with a mentor is that it doesn’t need to take a lot of their time. The best advice I’ve ever gotten is in short clips, having lunch or breakfast with somebody, just telling them what I’m working on and asking their advice. You will be amazed how successful businesspeople are willing to be mentors to people when it’s not taking a lot of time.” John Wooden reinforced that point to me when he shared, “Mentoring is your true legacy. It is the greatest inheritance you can give to others. And it should never end. It is why you get up every day. To teach and be taught.” He went on to explain that mentorship is also a two-way street. “An individual needs to be open to being mentored. It is our responsibility to be willing to allow our lives and our minds to be touched, molded, and strengthened by the people who surround us.” Develop Your Own Personal Board of Advisors As part of my plan to be wiser, more strategic, operate more effectively, and expand the time I have with high-minded leaders, I developed a board of advisors in my personal life. I hand-selected a dozen people because of their areas of expertise, creative thinking ability, and/or my great respect for who they are. Once a week I reach out to a few of them and solicit ideas, run thoughts by them, and ask for feedback and input. Having started this process, I can tell you the benefits I’ve already received have been profound—far more than I anticipated! It’s surprising the genius people are willing to share when you show sincere interest. Who should be on your personal board of advisors? Seek out positive people who have achieved the success you want to create in your own life. Remember the adage: “Never ask advice of someone with whom you wouldn’t want to trade places.” III. Environment: Changing Your View Changes Your Perspective When I was in real estate, working in the San Francisco Bay area, I lived and worked within a very limited demographic. I saw the same kinds of people operating at the same level over and over. I needed to find an elevated circle of associations in order to go where I wanted to go. I started driving across the bay to one of the richest and most beautiful spots on the planet, Tiburon in Marin County, north of San Francisco. If you’ve ever been to Monaco, that’s what Tiburon looks like, but far quainter. It’s a spectacular spot. I would go to a delightful seafood restaurant, Sam’s on the Wharf. The food was great, but more importantly, the restaurant was popular with the area’s more affluent residents. Aside from going to Sam’s to expand my associations, I’d also sit on the wharf and look up at the hillside. I was mesmerized by the multimillion-dollar houses that hung off the cliffs. One in particular always caught my eye—a blue, four-story home with an elevator and a whale lightning rod at the top. What would be the perfect house? I used to ask myself all the time. If someone could just give me one of them, which one would I pick? The answer was always the same—this beautiful blue one. It was in the perfect spot with a bright vista, the best of the bunch. On my way home from brunch one morning, I saw an open house sign and thought it’d be fun to check it out. One sign led to another as I followed them zigzagging up the cliffs along the narrow streets. I finally reached the top of the hill and found the advertised home. As I entered and walked up to a spectacular bay window, the world opened up in front of me—the peninsula tip of Tiburon, Angel Island across the Bay, Berkeley and the East Bay, the Bay Bridge, and the entire San Francisco skyline over to the Golden Gate Bridge in a 300-degree expanse. I walked out onto the balcony and looked around. Suddenly I realized that this was the very house I’d been looking at for years! This was the blue house! I signed the contract on the spot. My dream house was now mine! I can’t really say that I met anybody at Sam’s who changed my life. However, that environment had a powerful effect on me. Seeing those homes up on the cliffs fueled my ambition and expanded my dreams. I ended up working harder than I ever thought possible to make those dreams come true—and they did! The dream in your heart may be bigger than the environment in which you find yourself. Sometimes you have to get out of that environment to see that dream fulfilled. It’s like planting an oak sapling in a pot. Once it becomes rootbound, its growth is limited. It needs a great space to become a mighty oak. So do you. When I talk about your environment, I’m not only referring to where you live. I’m referring to whatever surrounds you. Creating a positive environment to support your success means clearing out all the clutter in your life. Not only the physical clutter that makes it hard for you to work productively and efficiently (although that’s important too!), but also the psychic clutter of whatever around you isn’t working, whatever’s broken, whatever makes you cringe. Each and every incomplete piece of your life exerts a draining force on you, sucking the energy of accomplishment and success out of you as surely as a vampire stealing your blood. Every incomplete promise, commitment, and agreement saps your strength because it blocks your momentum and inhibits your ability to move forward. Incomplete tasks keep calling you back to the past to take care of them. So think about what you can complete today. Additionally, when you’re creating an environment to support your goals, remember that you get in life what you tolerate. This is true in every area of your life—particularly within your relationships with family, friends, and colleagues. What you have decided to tolerate is also reflected in the situations and circumstances of your life right now. Put another way, you will get in life what you accept and expect you are worthy of. If you tolerate disrespect, you will be disrespected. If you tolerate people being late and making you wait, people will show up late for you. If you tolerate being underpaid and overworked, that will continue for you. If you tolerate your body being overweight, tired, and perpetually sick, it will be. It’s amazing how life will organize around the standards you set for yourself. Some people think they’re the victims of other people’s behavior, but in actuality, we have control over how people treat us. Protect your emotional, mental, and physical space. Then you can live with peace, rather than in the chaos and stress the world will hurl upon you. If you want to foster a disciplined routine of rhythms and consistency, so that Big Mo not only pays a visit to your house, but moves in, you have to be sure your environment is welcoming and supportive of you becoming, doing, and performing at world-class levels. While we’re on the topic of world-class, in the next chapter, I want to help you take everything you’ve learned thus far and give you the secret to accelerate your results. Achieving greater results with only a little more effort may feel a little like cheating or an unfair advantage. But who said life was fair?","output":"The passage you provided details the strong influence that choices, behaviors, and habits have on one's life, emphasizing the role of external forces. It suggests vigilance in managing these influences to ensure a positive life trajectory. There are three main areas of influence: 1. Input: The information you feed your mind can significantly affect your productivity and creativity. Consistently negative input like distressing news or trivial media content can foster a negative mindset, as your brain is hardwired to focus on survival and thus, potential threats. To counteract this, you should consciously seek out positive, inspirational, and educational materials to reprogram your mind for success. 2. Associations: The people you surround yourself with can greatly determine your success or failure. It's important to evaluate and categorize relationships into three areas: - Dissociations: Eliminate or limit contact with people who have a negative influence on your life. - Limited Associations: Spend less time with those who may not be as aligned with your goals but are a part of your life. - Expanded Associations: Increase your time with those who embody the traits and success you seek. This can include finding a mentor or joining groups that share your aspirations. 3. Environment: The physical and psychic surroundings also play a critical role. A positive environment is clutter-free and supportive of your goals. It reflects your standards and what you are willing to tolerate in life, and it impacts your emotional and mental well-being. The passage also highlights the importance of being proactive in shaping these influences. The following actions are recommended: - Consume quality input by selecting educational and positive content. - Carefully choose the people you associate with, aiming to spend time with those who are where you aspire to be. - Create and maintain an environment that supports your progress and reflects your personal standards. - Consider engaging with mentors, forming a personal board of advisors, and finding a performance partner for accountability and growth. Ultimately, the message is clear: to succeed and foster personal development, one must take full responsibility for their life by consciously managing these three areas of influence."},{"instruction":"more","output":"From the passage provided, it can be discerned that actively managing one's influences is critical for personal and professional growth. Here are some additional insights and detailed strategies for implementing the suggested ideas: **Implementing Positive Input:** - Begin each day with educational or motivational content. - Limit exposure to negative media by choosing specific times for consumption or cutting them out entirely. - Replace commute or idle time with personal development podcasts, audiobooks, or programs like DarrenDaily to enrich your mind. **Managing Associations:** - Assess your relationships by writing down the five people you spend the most time with and note their main attributes, to understand their influence on your life. - Consciously choose to spend more time with individuals who embody the success and values you admire. - Establish boundaries with negative individuals, which may necessitate difficult decisions, such as reducing or cutting off contact. **Enhancing Your Environment:** - Declutter and organize your physical space to create an environment conducive to productivity. - Ensure your personal environment reflects the level of success and wellness you desire. - Be willing to step out of your current environment to experience new perspectives and opportunities, like the example of visiting a more affluent area to expand one's vision and ambition. **Action Steps:** 1.

There are very few things you can do voluntarily that cause more pain and suffering than riding a bike up a steep mountain without stopping. There is a point at which you “hit the wall” and come face to face with your true inner character. Suddenly, all the projections and ideas you had about yourself are stripped away and you’re left with the naked truth. Your mind starts inventing all sorts of convenient alibis on why it’s okay to stop. It is then when you’re faced with one of life’s greatest questions: Do you push through the pain and continue on, or will you crack like a walnut and give up? Running the Boston Marathon in 2018, Desiree “Des” Linden seriously thought about quitting the race. It was wet, raining, and the coldest temperature in thirty years. Des was certain she hadn’t drunk enough fluids and was afraid of getting cramps in her legs. Des told fellow American Shalane Flanagan that she might drop out, so if she needed anything, like someone to block the wind for her, she better let her know soon before she quit. Shalane nudged Des to tell her she needed to hit the bathroom. Des slowed with her and promised she wouldn’t quit until she helped her rejoin the lead pack when she returned. Despite the freezing temperatures, even more rain, and running into the wind, Des helped Shalane get back to the front. That is when she realized that she was in third or fourth place. “I thought, ‘I probably shouldn’t drop out,’ so I kept going.… I felt miserable, and sometimes when you pick it up and just forget about how you’re feeling and just engage for a little bit, it can kind of turn everything around,” Des explained in a post-race interview. Flanagan then tired, but Des kept pushing forward. But she still had to chase down Mamitu Daska of Ethiopia, the Dubai and Houston marathon winner. Mamitu had separated from the lead pack before the halfway mark and led by as much as 30 seconds. Now alone, soaked to the bone, her legs beginning to cramp, and facing a headwind of 10 miles per hour, Des Linden finally passed Mamitu in the twenty-first mile, crossing the finish line in 2 hours, 39 minutes, 54 seconds, becoming the first American woman to win the Boston Marathon in thirty-three years. In this chapter, I want to talk to you about those moments of truth and how the Compound Effect can help you break through to new and greater levels of success—faster than you imagined possible. When you’ve prepared, practiced, studied, and consistently put in the required effort, sooner or later you’ll be presented with your own moment of truth. In that moment, you will define who you are and who you are becoming. It is in those moments where growth and improvement live—when we either step forward or shrink back, when we climb to the top of the podium and seize the medal or we continue to applaud sullenly from the crowd for others’ victories. We’ll also look at how you can consistently deliver more than people expect, compounding your good fortune even further. Moments of Truth “It’s supposed to be hard,” Des Linden told reporters after winning the Boston Marathon. Just the year before, she had almost given up on running altogether. “I had no passion at all,” she told the host of the podcast Only A Game. Des was burned out, having a horrible experience at a race, and was afraid that her results would tarnish a sport she really loved. Des didn’t run at all the month of August 2017, which is like Stephen Curry not stepping onto a basketball court, Aaron Rodgers not touching a football, or Serena Williams not picking up her racket for an entire month. But then Des started running again, slowly at first, and soon rediscovered her love of running. “I love competing. I decided not to concentrate on my results and my approach was ‘Just go and try to beat some people.’” A few months later is when Des won her first major marathon in Boston. When I was in real estate, I hit the wall several times a day. While driving to an expired listing property, after just getting pummeled by the last prospect, I’d start conjuring up all sorts of excuses to skip the sales call and head back to the office. While out canvassing a neighborhood, dogs would snarl at me or it looked like it might start to rain. I’d be in the midst of “money time” (5 to 9 p.m., cold-calling) and frequently get chewed out for interrupting someone’s dinner or favorite TV show. I was sure I needed to take a break to go to the bathroom or get a glass of water. But instead of quitting, every time I hit one of those mental and emotional walls, I recognized my competitors were facing the same challenges. I knew this was another moment when, if I kept going, I would gain strides ahead of them. These were the defining moments of success and progress. It wasn’t difficult, painful, or challenging when I was just running with the herd, just keeping up, but not really getting ahead. It’s not getting to the wall that counts. It’s what you do after you hit it that really matters. Lou Holtz, the famous football coach, knew it was what you did after you did your best that created victories. In one game, his team was down 42-0 at halftime. During the half-time break, Lou showed his team a dramatic highlight reel of second efforts to block, tackle, and recover the ball. He then told the players they were not on his team because they could give their all on every play. Every player on every team does that. He said they were on his team because of their ability to make that critical extra effort on each play. It’s the extra effort after you have done your best that is the difference-maker. His team went on to win the game in the second half. That is how you win. Muhammad Ali was one of the greatest fighters of all time, not only because of his speed and agility, but also because of his strategy. On October 30, 1974, Ali regained his heavyweight championship, besting George Foreman in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history in the “Rumble in the Jungle.” Almost no one, not even Ali’s longtime supporter Howard Cosell, believed the former champion had a chance of winning. Both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton had beaten Ali previously, and George Foreman had knocked both of them out in only the second round. Ali’s strategy? To take advantage of the younger champion’s weakness—his lack of staying power. Ali knew if he could get Foreman to his wall, he could then take the advantage. This is when Ali came up with the tactic later termed “Rope-a-Dope.” Ali would lean on the ropes, shielding his face, while Foreman threw hundreds of punches over seven rounds. By the eighth round, Foreman was exhausted. He was at his wall. It was then that Ali dropped Foreman with a combination at center ring. Remember the conditions that Des Linden faced? At the starting line, temperatures were so cold that runners were given an extra bib to wear over their layers of clothing. There were gusts of wind up to 35 miles per hour. And without nice weather, the crowds that a lot of runners count on were thin and spread out. “It was so bad that it was comical,” Linden told Only A Game. “The rain is just jumping on you. You’re soaking wet after one minute out there. And we [had] a few hours ahead of us.” But Des fought through the rain and the wind to break away from the pack of elite competition. She got to run past iconic landmarks like Fenway Park and Kenmore Square and finished soaked with pride. As difficult as the conditions were, that was Desiree’s day to triumph and win against all the odds. When conditions are great, things are easy, there aren’t any distractions, no one is interrupting, temptations aren’t luring, and nothing is disturbing your stride. It’s not until situations are difficult, when problems come up and temptation is great, that you get to prove your worthiness for progress. As Jim Rohn would say, “Don’t wish it were easier; wish you were better.” When you hit the wall in your disciplines, routines, rhythms, and consistency, realize that’s when you are separating yourself from your old self, scaling that wall, and finding your more powerful, triumphant, and victorious self. Multiplying Results I have an exciting opportunity for you. We’ve talked about how simple disciplines and behaviors will compound over time, delivering amazingly powerful results for you. What if you could speed up the process and multiply your results? Would you be interested? I want to show you how a little bit more effort can exponentially increase your outcomes. Let’s say you’re weight training and the program calls for you to do twelve repetitions of a certain weight. Now, if you do the twelve, you’re fulfilling the expectation of your program. Great job. Stay consistent, and ultimately, you will see this discipline compound into powerful results for you. Yet, if you get to twelve, even if you’ve hit your max, and you push out another three to five reps, your impact on that set will be multiplied several times. You won’t just add a few reps to the aggregate of your workout. No. Those reps done after you hit your max will multiply your results. You’ve pushed through the wall of your max. The previous reps only got you there. The real growth happens with what you do after you’re at the wall. Arnold Schwarzenegger made famous a weight training method called “The Cheating Principle.” Arnold was a stickler for perfect technique. He contended that once you reached your maximum number of lifts in perfect form, adjusting your wrists or leaning back to recruit other muscles to assist the working muscles (cheating a little) would allow you to do five or six more reps, which would significantly improve the results of that set. You can also achieve this by having a workout partner who assists the last few reps you couldn’t have done on your own. If you’re a runner, you know the experience. You reach the goal you set for yourself that day and you’re feeling the burn. You’re at your wall, but you go a little farther, a little longer. This “little longer” is really a massive expansion of your limits. You have multiplied the results of that single run. Take the magic penny we talked about in Chapter 1, the one that doubles in value each day, showing you the result of small compounded actions. If you only doubled that penny one extra time per week during those same thirty-one days, the compounded penny would result in 171 million instead of 10 million. Again, just extra effort in four days and the result was many times greater. That is how the math of doing only a little bit more than expected works. Viewing yourself as your toughest competitor is one of the best ways to multiply your results. Go above and beyond when you hit the wall. Another way to multiply your results is pushing past what other people expect of you—doing more than “enough.” Beat the Expectations Oprah is famous for using this principle—blasting beyond anyone’s expectations with her generosity and ability to live and work in a BIG way. Do you remember how she launched her nineteenth season? When it comes to Oprah, we knew to expect some fanfare… but she blew everyone away. That season opener was all the media or anyone else talked about for days afterward. Let’s go back in time for a minute… The audience members were selected because their friends and family members had written in, saying each of them desperately needed a new car. Oprah opened the show by calling eleven people to the stage. She gave every one of them a car—a Pontiac G6. Then the real surprise: She surpassed everyone’s expectations when she distributed gift boxes to the rest of the audience, saying one of the boxes contained a key to the twelfth car. But when the audience, members opened their boxes, every one of them had a set of keys. She screamed, “Everybody gets a car! Everybody gets a car!” While this might be her most famous example, Oprah continues to go beyond our expectations in most everything she does. In other segments, Oprah surprised a twenty-year-old girl who had spent years in foster care and homeless shelters with a four-year college scholarship, a makeover, and 10,000 in clothes. And, she gave a family with eight foster children who were going to be kicked out of their house 130,000 to pay for and repair their home. Now you might be saying, yeah, but she’s Oprah, of course she can do those things. But the truth is there are plenty of others in Oprah’s position—with the finances and the fame—who could do those things, but never venture into the realm of extraordinary. Oprah does. That’s what makes her Oprah. Take a lesson from her. You can do more than expected in every aspect of your life. When it was time to propose to my wife, Georgia, I could have done what was expected and met with her father to ask for his daughter’s hand in marriage. Instead, I decided to pay great respect to her father by preparing my speech in Portuguese (I got Georgia’s sister to translate what I wanted to say). He understood English well enough, but wasn’t entirely comfortable with it. The entire drive from San Diego to Los Angeles, I rehearsed the words. I walked through the door carrying flowers and treats and asked her dad to join us in the living room. Then I delivered my memorized speech. After a little future father-in-law grilling, he finally said, “Yes!” But I didn’t stop there. On the way back, and over the next couple of days, I called each one of her FIVE brothers and also asked for their blessing to join the family. Some were easy to convince, others proceeded to have me “earn it.” The point is, she told me later that one of the most special aspects about how I proposed was how I had honored her dad and how I had called every one of her brothers (and had her sister teach me Portuguese). That made the act extra special. The result of that extra effort paid off exponentially. Where in life can you do more than expected when you hit the wall? Or where can you go for “WOW”? It doesn’t take a lot more effort, but the little extra multiplies your results many times over. Whether you’re making calls, serving customers, recognizing your team, acknowledging your spouse, going for a run, bench-pressing, planning a date night, sharing time with your kids, whatever… What’s the little extra you can do that exceeds expectations and accelerates your results? Do the Unexpected I’m a contrarian by nature. Tell me what most people are doing and what’s popular, and I will typically do the opposite. If everyone is zigging, I’m gonna zag. To me, what’s popular is average, it’s what’s common. Common things deliver common results. The most popular restaurant is McDonald’s, the most popular drink is Coca-Cola, the most popular beer is Budweiser, the most popular wine is Franzia (yeah, the stuff that comes in a box!). Consume those “popular” things and you’ll be part of the common, average pack. But that’s ordinary. There’s nothing wrong with ordinary. I just prefer to shoot for extraordinary. For instance, everyone sends Christmas cards. But, since everyone does, it doesn’t really have much emotional impact, in my opinion. So I choose to send Thanksgiving cards instead. How many Thanksgiving cards do you get? Exactly. It makes a statement. And instead of bulk-printed, computer-generated “best wishes” cards, I handwrite personal sentiments expressing how grateful I am for my relationship with that person and what he or she means to me—same effort, but a much greater impact. Lady Gaga has built a career on doing the unexpected. In 2011, she claimed to have slept in an oversized translucent egg for seventy-two hours in order to have “creative, embryonic incubation.” And who can forget about the meat dress and snow boots she wore to the MTV Video Music Awards? Honestly, I don’t pay attention to celebrities and award shows, but even I knew about that one. Lady Gaga has always been truly different and over the top—until she suddenly wasn’t. Starring in A Star Is Born alongside Bradley Cooper, she appeared stripped-down and vulnerable. Off-screen, she recorded an album with crooner legend Tony Bennett and advocated for LGBTQ+ rights and mental health issues. And, most importantly, even though Lady Gaga’s pop persona continues to evolve and change, her artistry is consistent. She’s always making us say “wow,” and that extra effort gets us to pay attention to everything she does. More often than not, the extra effort doesn’t cost that much more money or energy. When I was selling real estate, other agents would call on expired listings when they came up. Instead, I got in my car and showed up on the owners’ doorstep and hand-delivered a “SOLD” sign. “Take this,” I’d say when the owner opened the door. “You’ll need it if you hire me to take over this listing.” For the price it took to keep my gas tank full, I immediately and exponentially increased my chance of getting the listing. A little while back, a friend of mine, Alex, was up for a big job. He lives in California and the job was in Boston. He was one of the final twelve candidates. They were going to interview local candidates in person and those out of the area via video conferencing. He called me, asking if I knew how to facilitate a web camera video conference. “How badly do you want this job?” I asked him. “It’s my dream job,” Alex told me. “It’s everything I’ve spent forty-five years preparing to do.” “Then get on a plane and show up in person.” I said. “No need,” Alex said, “They’re flying in the final three for a last interview.” “Listen,” I told him. “If you want to be in that final three, you should separate yourself by doing the unexpected. Fly across the country on a moment’s notice and show up in person. That’s how you make a statement.” If I set my sights on something, I’m going to ensure success by going all in and all out. I launch what I call “shock and awe” campaigns. During this same job hunt, I suggested Alex pull out all the stops—attack from every possible front and do it relentlessly. “Research all the decision makers,” I told him. “Find out their interests, hobbies, kids’ hobbies, spouses’ hobbies, neighbors’ hobbies, etc. Send them books, articles, gifts, and other resources that you think they might like. Is this over the top? Heck, yes, that’s the point. They’ll know you’re trying to butter them up, but they’ll appreciate your gumption and creativity—you’ll certainly get their attention and most likely, their respect.” Then I continued: “Research all the people in the organization. Take that list and run it by your entire network to see if they know anyone who might know someone in this organization. Search every name against your LinkedIn database. Find a few people to connect with. Talk with them and ask them to put in a good word for you. Send them gifts, notes, and other things, and ask them to hand-deliver them to the decision makers. Phone, e-mail, text, tweet, Facebook, etc. them during the process.” Could this be overly aggressive? Heck, yes! But I was told early on by a mentor, “You may lose one out of five for being too aggressive… but you get the other four! You can’t be too aggressive.” By the way, Alex did not take my advice, and he did not get the job. He didn’t even get to be in the final three. I can unequivocally say he was a far better choice than the person the organization hired, but Alex failed to make an impression, and it cost him his dream job. A while back, I was on the board of a company that needed a congressman to sign off on a piece of legislation that affected whether this company could move forward on an important project. This guy wasn’t budging, not because of the actual issue, but because of a political axe he was grinding against others who publicly favored the issue. Instead of making any more futile appeals to sway him, I suggested we go above his head and talk to his boss—his wife. We went through our network until one person led us to someone who was friends with his wife. We then waited for her outside following a church service she attended and had her friend introduce us. We explained our important case and cause, which was to build an after-school facility in an impoverished neighborhood that would affect the lives of hundreds of children if her husband would support it. Needless to say, he signed on by Tuesday that following week and the company got its project. In our attention-deficit, propaganda-saturated society, sometimes doing the unexpected is required to get your voice heard. If you have a cause or ideal worthy of attention, do what it takes, even the unexpected, to make your case heard. Add a little audacity to your repertoire. Do Better Than Expected Find the line of expectation and then exceed it. Even when it comes to the small stuff—or maybe especially then. Whatever I think the dress standard is going to be for any event, for example, I always choose to go at least one step above it. When I am unsure of the attire, I always err on the side of dressing better than I suppose the occasion calls for. Simple, I know, but it’s just one way I try to meet the standard to always do and be better than expected. When I keynote for large companies, I spend a considerable amount of time preparing—learning about their organization, products, markets, and their expectations for my talk. My goal is always to significantly surpass what they expect, and I do this through tireless preparation. Doing better than expected becomes a big part of your reputation. Your reputation for excellence multiplies your results in the marketplace many times over. I did a project with entrepreneur superstar Marc Sparks. That is when I learned a very valuable philosophy. He always paid people, including his vendors and suppliers, a few days in advance of the contract commitment. I was always blown away when I received a check on the twenty-seventh of the month from him for next month’s payment. When I asked him about it, he said the obvious, “It’s the same money, but the surprise and goodwill it buys is immeasurable—why wouldn’t you?” It is why I send the bonus checks to my A-Team via FedEx delivery. Their regular monthly compensation is electronically deposited into their accounts. But when we hit a bonus milestone, I have their bonus checks printed and then packaged, with a personal handwritten note from me, into a distinctive FedEx envelope and sent to their doorstep overnight. This way the whole family can share in and celebrate Mommy’s or Daddy’s achievements. As Marc said, “It’s the same money, but the surprise and goodwill it buys is immeasurable—why wouldn’t you?” Nordstrom is famous for a similar standard. When it comes to customer service, they always strive to do better than expected. Nordstrom has been known to take back an item that a customer bought more than a year ago, without a receipt, and in some cases, purchased at a different store! Why would they do that? Because they know exceeding expectations builds trust and creates customer loyalty. As a result, Nordstrom has developed an extraordinary reputation that continues to attract attention. After all, I’m reminding you of it here. The multiplier keeps growing! I challenge you to adopt these philosophies in your own life—in your daily habits, disciplines, and routines. Giving a little more time, energy, or thought to your efforts won’t only improve your results, it will multiply them. It takes very little extra to be EXTRAordinary. In all areas of your life, look for the multiplier opportunities where you can go a little further, push yourself a little harder, last a little longer, prepare a little better, and deliver a little bit more. Where can you do better and more than expected? When can you do the totally unexpected? Find as many opportunities for “WOW,” and the level and speed of your accomplishments will astonish you… and everyone else around you.","output":"From this narrative, I learned about the importance of perseverance, the concept of \\"hitting the wall,\\" and the transformative power of pushing beyond one's perceived limits. The narrative also touches on the Compound Effect, which emphasizes that small, consistent efforts can lead to significant results over time, especially when paired with additional effort once a plateau or \\"wall\\" is encountered. Key takeaways include: 1. Facing Moments of Truth: - Challenging activities like cycling up a steep hill or running a marathon in adverse conditions force us to confront our inner character. - At the point of greatest difficulty or \\"hitting the wall,\\" we must choose to either push through despite the pain or give up. 2. Compounding Success with Effort: - Beyond basic practice and preparation, real progress is achieved when we push past our moments of truth. - This concept is echoed in stories of sports figures like Des Linden and influential coaches who underscore the necessity of extra effort for victory. 3. Doing the Unexpected: - In a world of distractions and commonality, doing the unexpected can set you apart and garner attention. - Examples of this principle include sending Thanksgiving cards instead of Christmas cards or showing up in person when video conferencing is expected. 4. Exceeding Expectations: - Whether it be by dressing a notch above the expected, preparing more thoroughly for presentations, or paying vendors early, exceeding expectations builds a reputation for excellence. - Companies like Nordstrom have benefited from a policy of exceeding expectations, leading to customer loyalty and a strong brand reputation. 5. Multiplying Results: - A little more effort, especially after reaching your initial maximum, can lead to exponential results. - This approach can be applied in various contexts, from physical training to work-related tasks, where pushing past comfort zones significantly enhances outcomes. 6. Going for “WOW”: - Seeking to impress and surprise others with actions that are not just satisfactory but remarkable can have long-lasting effects and multiply your success. - This can manifest in personalized gestures, creative problem solving, or simply doing what others won't to make a lasting impression. To implement these lessons, one could: - Adopt a mindset geared toward continuous improvement, recognizing that endurance through discomfort can lead to growth. - Consistently look for opportunities to go beyond what is expected, both in professional and personal aspects of life. - Embrace challenges as moments to demonstrate character and perseverance. - Create a habit of seeking the unexpected route to stand out and create a unique, memorable impact. - Apply the Compound Effect by recognizing that small additional efforts can have outsized effects on results. By employing these principles, individuals can aim to not just achieve their goals, but surpass them, thus reaching new levels of success and fulfillment."},{"instruction":"more","output":"Beyond what was already summarized, further insights I gathered from the narrative are: 7. The Necessity of a Support System: - In Des Linden's story, support played a crucial role; her intention to help a fellow competitor provided her with the motivation to continue and eventually win the Boston Marathon. - Building and maintaining a network of support can be pivotal in overcoming challenges and reaching your goals. 8. Engaging in Mental Discipline: - The narrative highlights the mental battle that occurs when pushing past the comfort zone. It's important to manage the negative self-talk and rationalizations that encourage quitting. - Developing mental toughness and positive self-talk can be critical skills to nurture for perseverance and success. 9. Strategic Patience and Timing: - Extraordinary results often require strategic planning and an understanding of timing, as shown by Lady Gaga's carefully crafted public persona. - This strategy can apply in many realms including personal branding, marketing, and career development. 10. Learning from Loss or Failure: - Stories of individuals who faced burnout or considered quitting their passions (like Des Linden's temporary break from running) remind us that periods of rest and reflection can be integral to long-term success. - Learning from experiences of loss or failure can serve as a foundation for a stronger comeback. 11. Customization and Personalization: - The practice of sending personalized correspondence or showing up in person when least expected can have a dramatic impact because it shows thoughtfulness and dedication. - Customizing your approach to meet the unique preferences of others can enhance relationships and open doors to new opportunities. Implementation Tactics: - Set clear personal and professional challenges that are slightly outside of your comfort zone to regularly \\"hit the wall\\" and grow. - Reflect on past experiences where you've overcome significant barriers, and use those memories as motivation for future challenges. - Create a formal or informal accountability group to provide mutual encouragement during tough times. - Practice mindfulness or other mental exercises to strengthen your ability to cope with challenging situations. - Analyze the timing and approach of your efforts, looking for opportunities to make a greater impact. - Recognize when it's time to pause and recharge, and use downtime strategically to come back stronger. - Look for opportunities to provide highly personalized interactions in your personal and professional relationships to stand out. - Embrace a creative mindset to find non-conventional solutions that go beyond the status quo to resolve problems or deliver on your objectives. In summary, the narrative encourages undaunted commitment to one's goals, leveraging the Compound Effect, and consecutively pushing boundaries—not just to succeed but to exceed expectations and create multiplier effects in various aspects of life."},{"instruction":"阅读下面的评论，总结大家对当前股票的评价，条数不超过15条；并总结；如果有有用的信息，请告诉我： 评论内容 评论时间 30000元玩转广联达！（记录贴） 2023-12-25 15:22:49 资金偏好超跌股 2023-12-28 14:52:31 要T的赶紧啊，明儿个大涨~！ 2023-12-26 11:00:42 一割就涨，亏了10W++，大腿拍断， 2023-12-28 13:30:53 师姐18.3已建仓广联达 2023-10-30 17:23:40 前两天叫你们买你们不买，现在追涨的话不是很明智噢 2023-12-28 13:25:57 快到成本了，到了撤，太折磨了[怒] 2023-12-28 14:53:43 跌这么久了。 2023-12-28 14:51:55 我的要求不高 2023-12-28 14:04:41 砸起来，傻瓜们 2023-12-28 14:37:37 达董今早电视上13频道上露脸了能否股价一发冲天呢 2023-12-28 14:21:46 T狗失算了吧 2023-12-28 13:50:43 卖飞 2023-12-28 13:05:24 昨天刚割了，我考 2023-12-28 13:39:04 真是绝了。一买就跌，割肉就涨。 2023-12-28 13:16:50 一卖就涨[哭][哭][哭] 2023-12-28 13:29:59 昨天骂街的出来走两步 2023-12-28 12:06:34 哎呀呀哎呀呀，都是口袋里无钱的祸 2023-12-28 13:11:46 广联达12月28日盘中涨幅达5% 2023-12-28 13:02:20 我又回来了16.49插进 2023-12-25 11:46:36 加仓到120w了，别跌了[哭] 2023-12-27 14:28:38 德联科技让我催的涨停了，你也快了 2023-12-28 11:23:26 这种一路阴跌下来的票除非从底部连拉四五个板，否则就算是反弹也不利索。 2023-12-28 11:20:38 16年股龄，遇到最最恶心的股！没有之一！贱呀，咋选他呢？？永远的痛 2023-12-28 09:43:54 差不多了，现在开始慢慢买 2023-12-27 23:11:18 大家发现广联达一直在跌跌不停，但是很多小散还看不清，甚至我做分析时还人身攻击，我 2023-12-28 09:32:35 好了，回调到位了，开始反弹吧。站上19。大家一起冲 2023-12-28 09:52:22 这个板块逆子到底是什么情况，为什么一直跌 2023-12-27 11:50:25 先走一半，这勾东西又要不干人事了 2023-12-28 10:00:49 压的这个厉害 2023-12-28 10:25:02 让你们买，有人买了没 2023-12-28 10:18:01 2023年总结，最大的失误就是5000多支股票里买了广联达 2023-12-28 09:09:13 要涨了吗？？？？ 2023-12-28 09:50:59 大话榜 2023-12-28 09:32:25 持有广联达的韭菜吧说好了，永远都不要想解套，此话说在这里，明天继续下跌，16/1 2023-12-27 21:48:05 广联达12月27日被深股通减持270.83万股 2023-12-28 04:26:30 广联达：融资净买入398.28万元，融资余额4.21亿元（12-27） 2023-12-28 08:52:31 他NND的！51的本儿这辈子还能看到希望吗？ 2023-12-26 11:32:21 可以抄底， 2023-12-23 22:21:12 不要联的，天天阴跌，何时到头 2023-12-28 00:37:28 自打买了广联达，每个月都是超过1％的股民！1％的或许前几个月是大涨的！呀，上 2023-12-27 20:06:54 主力天天出货，这股没有 2023-12-27 14:49:34 天哪，广联达这是怎么了？没完没了地跌 2023-12-27 17:16:12 这个票是不是有什么内部消息没有公布，一直跌，我20买的，以为捡到宝了，，买进 2023-12-27 19:17:02 远离夕阳行业 2023-12-27 19:24:41 广联达股价连续2日创近5年新低 2023-12-27 15:46:13 买在无人问津处，卖在人生鼎沸时。 2023-12-27 14:32:07 观察了一段时间，这玩意没有底，底可能10元以下，等待吧，别买套了 2023-12-26 11:14:50 年末了还有数据要素×”计划出台，看来明年大数据也是十分受重视的。 2023-12-27 12:52:08 每天都是早上开盘最高位，然后一路下跌拉尾盘。哪天低开高走或者尾盘收高也就是反弹到 2023-12-27 14:39:14 快跑吧 2023-12-27 14:38:48 @rew394978 哈哈，你那天不是说稳赚的吗，两个星期下来，比那天都跌15% 2023-12-27 14:29:35 恶心想吐 2023-12-27 14:38:23 我承认我笨我没打算买最低点，今天锁好等明年国庆再看 2023-12-27 13:40:46 下跌明显，皮啊 2023-12-27 14:05:21 下星期15见，留贴 2023-12-27 13:49:52 暖暖的，自选里面唯一一个跌的。 2023-12-27 13:54:54 丝毫不跟大盘～ 2023-12-27 13:45:44 板块全红，他竟然是绿的，买你是我最大的痛，我的心一天一天的在滴血 2023-12-27 13:17:49 广联达(SZ002410) 2023-12-27 13:35:57 这哪里是股票？明明是惊悚片吗！ 2023-12-27 13:16:21 哎根本卖不完 2023-12-27 13:25:54 烂到家了 2023-12-27 13:22:32 卖公司？ 2023-12-27 11:30:19 还有那个股票如他一般垃圾，我16.6卖出去一部分后，还后悔了半天，没想到这货还能 2023-12-27 13:15:24 割了受不了了 2023-12-27 13:12:18 完蛋了，破位了， 2023-12-27 10:18:35 近3500家上涨，你真的牛，达子 2023-12-27 11:28:46 12见 2023-12-27 11:17:14 你抄他底，它抄你家。 2023-12-27 11:17:06 广联达股价创近5年新低 2023-12-26 15:58:30 到15块的话可以补了吗 2023-12-27 11:06:11 一步步的滑向深渊 2023-12-27 11:03:08 直接满仓干不看空 2023-12-27 10:52:30 抄底抄底！ 2023-12-27 10:26:26 每天都是新低，这股没灵魂 2023-12-27 10:20:15 你们这些贪生怕死的缩头乌龟，竞然见死不救！ 2023-12-25 11:10:18 看来今天有可能跌停 2023-12-27 09:18:47 跌跌不休，皆因没有掌握核心科技！ 2023-12-27 10:17:35 我刚买入，不知道能不能赚到钱 2023-12-27 10:00:02","output":"大家对当前股票的评价可以总结为： 1. 资金偏好超跌股。 2. 认为股票即将大涨。 3. 有人亏损严重。 4. 有人建仓广联达。 5. 持有成本较高的人想要撤出。 6. 股价跌得很久。 7. 对广联达不满，甚至进行人身攻击。 8. 有人感叹自己是赌输了。 9. 有人认为股价跌得很绝望。 10. 有人买到底部，期待反弹。 11. 认为广联达是恶心的股票。 12. 担心广联达没有底。 13. 有人认为明年大数据受重视。 14. 个别人认为股票没灵魂。 15. 有人认为广联达没有掌握核心科技。 有用的信息： 1. 广联达近期股价连续下跌。 2. 有资金净买入广联达的情况发生。 3. 广联达受到深股通减持。 4. 广联达股价创近5年新低。"},{"instruction":"Напиши мне скрипт на PoweShell для подсчёта кол-во компьютеров в указанном мной каталоге в ActiveDirectory","output":"Для подсчета количества компьютеров в определенном каталоге (Organizational Unit, OU) в Active Directory (AD) с помощью PowerShell, можно использовать командлет \`Get-ADComputer\` из модуля \`ActiveDirectory\`.

Factors of Production (生产要素): 生产要素包括土地（land）、劳动（labor）、资本（capital）和企业家精神（entrepreneurship）。 3. Opportunity Cost (机会成本): 机会成本是指为了得到某样东西而放弃获取其它东西的机会时的最高价值。 例子: 如果你有两小时并决定看电影，你放弃的机会成本可能是这段时间内无法做其它有价值的事情，比如工作或学习。 4. 画出 Demand and Supply 的图: \`\`\` Price ^ | | D | ／| | ／ | |／ | |-----------> Quantity ＼ S ＼ | ＼| P* Q* \`\`\` 图中，Price是价格，Quantity是数量，D是需求曲线，S是供应曲线，P*是均衡价格，Q*是均衡数量。 5. 影响供应的因素 (Factors that Affect Supply): - 生产成本 - 技术变革 - 供应商的数量 - 预期价格变化 - 政府政策，如税收、补贴 - 自然条件，如天气 等供应曲线左移表示供应减少，导致均衡价格升高，均衡数量减少；供应曲线右移表示供应增加，均衡价格降低，均衡数量增加。 6. 影响需求的因素 (Factors that Affect Demand): - 收入水平 - 价格和替代品的关系 - 价格和互补品的关系 - 市场人口的变化 - 预期未来价格变化 - 个人偏好 需求曲线右移表示需求增加，导致均衡价格和数量增加；需求曲线左移表示需求减少，均衡价格和数量减少。 7. Price Ceiling (最高价格): 最高价格是政府设定的商品或服务价格的上限，意图保护消费者不受价格过高的影响。 政府设置最高价格可能导致市场出现短缺，供不应求。 8. 价格弹性 (Price Elasticity of Demand, PED): PED = (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔP/P) - PED > 1 表示需求弹性大，价格变动会引起数量需求的较大变化。 - PED < 1 表示需求弹性小，价格变动对数量需求的影响较小。 收入弹性 (Income Elasticity of Demand, YED): YED = (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔY/Y) - YED > 0 表示随着收入增加，需求量增加。 - YED < 0 表示随着收入增加，需求量减少。 高定价商品公司希望需求是不弹性的，因为这样收入变化不会大幅影响销量。这可以通过建立品牌忠诚度或降低替代品吸引力来实现。 9. Injections and Withdrawals: 注入和提取是循环流转收入模型中的概念。 注入（Injections）指的是投资、政府支出和出口等向经济注入资金的行为。 提取（Withdrawals）指的是税收、储蓄和进口等从经济抽走资金的行为。 均衡状态是当注入等于提取时，整个经济处于平衡状态。如果提取大于注入，可能会导致经济衰退；反之，如果注入大于提取，则可能导致经济增长。 10. Circular Flow of Income的局限性: - 忽略了经济活动的环境和社会影响。 - 没有考虑到外部经济的作用，如国际贸易。 - 假设市场在所有情况下都是有效率的，没有考虑到市场失灵。 11. Multiplier (乘数效应)： 乘数效应是指某个初始支出增加可以导致国民收入多次增加的现象。 对比不同国家的国民收入时，存在的困难包括: - 不同国家的币值和购买力不同。 - 统计方法和所依据的标准可能不同。 - 黑市经济和非正式部门的规模难以准确估计。 12. Market Failure (市场失灵): 市场失灵指的是市场未能有效分配资源，导致资源配置不佳。 市场失灵的类型包括: - 公共物品及外部性问题。 - 信息不对称。 - 垄断或寡头垄断市场。 英国政府应对市场失灵的措施可能包括: - 提供公共物品及对有负外部性活动征税。 - 通过监管和立法解决信息不对称的问题。 - 通过反垄断法规限制市场垄断。 13. 英国政府政策分析 (Assignment): 政策分析需要深入了解英国政府的经济政策，可能涉及财政政策、货币政策、工业政策等多个方面。具体方法可能包括分析政策的意图、实施手段、预期效果和实际成效。这通常需要整合经济理论、历史数据和当前经济状况，并要考虑到政策对不同人群的影响。"},{"instruction":"补充一下问题12市场失灵类型几个点的分析内容同时给我如上回答的英文","output":"12. 市场失灵的类型分析: - 公共物品: 公共物品是指那些无法有效通过市场进行排他性消费的商品或服务。这种商品的特性导致私人市场无法为它们产生适当的价格机制，如灯塔和国防。因此，需要政府干预来提供这些公共物品。 - 外部性: 外部性是市场活动对第三方产生的、未被市场价格反映的费用或收益。负外部性如环境污染需要政府介入以征税或制定法规来纠正这种市场失灵；而正外部性可能需要政府的补贴或支持，如教育和疫苗接种。 - 信息不对称: 当市场中一方拥有比另一方更多的关于交易对象的信息时，就会出现信息不对称。这可能导致市场无效率并产生逆向选择和道德风险问题。政府可以通过法规要求信息披露和反欺诈法律来解决这些问题。 - 垄断或寡头垄断市场: 在垄断或寡头垄断市场中，一个或几个供应商控制了大部分市场份额，可能会滥用市场权力设定过高的价格和过低的产量。政府可以通过反垄断法、价格控制或其他调控措施来干预。 这是上述内容的英文翻译： Market Failure Types Analysis: - Public Goods: Public goods are those that cannot be consumed exclusively through the market due to their non-excludable nature. The characteristics of these goods prevent private markets from generating proper pricing mechanisms for them, such as lighthouses and national defense. Hence, government intervention is required to provide these public goods. - Externalities: Externalities are costs or benefits generated by market activities that affect third parties and are not reflected in market prices. Negative externalities, such as environmental pollution, necessitate government intervention to correct this market failure through taxation or regulation; while positive externalities may require government subsidies or support, such as education and vaccination programs. - Information Asymmetry: Information asymmetry occurs when one party in the market has more information about the object of transaction than the other. This can lead to market inefficiencies and result in adverse selection and moral hazard. Governments can address these issues with regulations mandating disclosure and anti-fraud laws. - Monopoly or Oligopoly Markets: In monopoly or oligopoly markets, one or a few suppliers control the majority of market share and can abuse their market power by setting excessively high prices and too low quantities. Governments can intervene through anti-trust laws, price controls, or other regulatory measures."},{"instruction":"9 解释 injections and withdrawals 对于 the circular flow 的影响 1) 描述 Circular flow of Income；要素有哪些，如何流动 2） What are the injections and withdrawals? 解释 Injection 和 withdrawal。 3) What is the equilibrium of injections and withdrawals? 解释 Circular flow of Income 均衡。","output":"9. Injections and withdrawals impact the circular flow of income by altering the amount of money that circulates through the economy. Here's a detailed explanation: 1) Description of the Circular Flow of Income: The circular flow of income is a model that describes the movement of money, resources, and goods and services in an economy. It involves two main sectors: households and firms. Households provide the factors of production (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship) to firms, and in return, they receive incomes in the form of wages, rent, interest, and profits. Firms use these factors to produce goods and services that households purchase with the income they earn, creating a circular flow of money. 2) Injections and Withdrawals: Injections into the circular flow are additional external spending, other than from households, that keeps money flowing through the system. Examples of injections include government spending (G), investments (I) from the business sector, and exports (X) that bring money into the economy from abroad. Withdrawals (or leakages) are portions of income that are not used for domestic expenditures on goods and services produced within the economy. Withdrawals include taxes (T) paid to the government, savings (S) which are funds not spent on consumption, and imports (M) which are payments going out of the economy. 3) Equilibrium of Injections and Withdrawals: Equilibrium occurs in the circular flow of income when the total injections are equal to total withdrawals. This means the rate at which money is injected into the economy is equal to the rate at which it is withdrawn. In this state, the national output, income, and expenditure are balanced, and the economy is said to be in a steady state without any tendency towards expansion or contraction. When injections exceed withdrawals, there is a net inflow of money, leading to economic growth. Conversely, if withdrawals exceed injections, there is a net outflow, which may cause the economy to shrink or slow down. The goal of economic policy is often to manage these injections and withdrawals to maintain a stable and growing economy."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The basic economic problem arises because resources are scarce while human wants are unlimited. This scarcity requires us to make decisions on how to allocate resources efficiently to meet our needs and desires. 2. Factors of production are the resources used to produce goods and services. They include: - Land: All natural resources used in production (e.g., minerals, forests, water). - Labor: Human effort provided in the creation of products (e.g., workers). - Capital: Man-made goods used in further production (e.g., machinery, buildings). - Entrepreneurship: The ability to combine the other factors of production and take on the risks of creating new businesses. 3. Opportunity cost is the next best alternative foregone when a decision is made. For example, if you decide to spend an hour studying instead of working a job that pays 15 an hour, the opportunity cost of studying is the 15 you could have earned. 4. Here's a simple diagram of demand and supply: \`\`\` Price | | S | / | / | / |/_____________ D | | | |____________________ Quantity | Equilibrium Point \`\`\` Where 'S' is the supply curve, 'D' is the demand curve, and their intersection is the equilibrium point with the corresponding equilibrium price and quantity. 5. Factors affecting supply: - Cost of production: An increase in production costs can decrease supply. - Technology: Advances can increase supply. - Taxes and subsidies: Taxes decrease supply, and subsidies increase supply. - Prices of other goods: An increase in the price of alternative goods can decrease supply. - Expectations: Future expectations can influence current supply. If any of these factors change, they can shift the supply curve. A decrease in supply will shift the curve left, resulting in a higher price and lower quantity at the new equilibrium. An increase in supply will shift the curve right, resulting in a lower price and higher quantity at the new equilibrium. 6. Factors affecting demand: - Price of the good: An increase will decrease demand, and vice versa (law of demand). - Income: An increase in consumers' income increases demand for normal goods. - Tastes and preferences: More popularity increases demand. - Prices of related goods: An increase in the price of a substitute or a decrease in the price of a complement increases demand. - Future expectations: Expectations of higher prices can increase current demand. Changes in these factors shift the demand curve. An increase in demand shifts the curve rightward, causing a higher equilibrium price and quantity. A decrease in demand shifts the curve leftward, leading to a lower equilibrium price and quantity. 7. Price ceiling (maximum price) is a legally established maximum price that sellers cannot exceed. Below is a graph illustrative of this: \`\`\` Price | |______ Price Ceiling | .|. (Shortage) | D | | | | | | / | | / |S | / |____/________________ Quantity \`\`\` A price ceiling set below the equilibrium price leads to a shortage as demand exceeds supply at that price level. Consumers may face problems obtaining the product. 8. Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price: \`PED = % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Price\` - PED > 1 means demand is elastic; consumers are very responsive to price changes. - PED < 1 means demand is inelastic; consumers are less responsive to price changes. Income Elasticity of Demand (YED) measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in consumer income: \`YED = % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Income\` - YED > 0 indicates a normal good; demand increases as income goes up. - YED < 0 indicates an inferior good; demand decreases as income goes up. High-priced product companies usually prefer inelastic demand, so consumers will not reduce their purchases significantly if the price increases. To achieve less sensitivity to income changes, firms can focus on brand loyalty, product differentiation, and marketing. 9. Injections are inputs into the circular flow of income, such as investments, government spending, and exports. Withdrawals are leakages from the flow, which include savings, taxes, and imports. Equilibrium occurs when total injections equal total withdrawals. If withdrawals exceed injections, it may lead to an economic contraction, while if injections exceed withdrawals, it may result in economic growth. The circular flow affects GDP as it reflects the overall expenditure and income throughout the economy; aggregate demand and supply are also a representation of the circular flow within a wider economic context. 10. Weaknesses of the circular flow model include its simplification and exclusion of financial markets, the role of the government, international trade, and the environment, among other factors. It is an idealized representation that assumes a closed economy with no saving or investment. 11. The multiplier effect occurs when an initial injection into the economy has a larger final impact on income. Comparing national incomes across countries can be difficult due to differences in currency values, economic structure, data gathering techniques, and price levels. 12. Market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient. Types include public goods, externalities, and information asymmetries. For instance, the UK government may regulate monopolies, provide public goods, and implement taxation to correct externalities. 13. Analyzing UK government policies would involve examining current fiscal, monetary, and regulatory measures and reviewing their impact on the economy, including their effects on market failures, competitiveness, and income distribution. Specific policies should be considered within the context of present economic conditions and challenges."},{"instruction":"9 解释 injections and withdrawals 对于 the circular flow 的影响 1) 描述 Circular flow of Income；要素有哪些，如何流动 2） What are the injections and withdrawals? 解释 Injection 和 withdrawal。 3) What is the equilibrium of injections and withdrawals? 解释 Circular flow of Income 均衡。 4) What happens if withdrawals are greater than injections? 5) What happens if injections are greater than withdrawals? 6) How the circular flow affects the GDP?

Instead, it proposes that freeing oneself from the burden of ownership can lead to a lighter and more fulfilling existence. It implies that by not being tied down by material possessions, one is liberated from the worries, responsibilities, and desires that often come with ownership. This phrase might evoke contrasting reactions depending on an individual's personal values and beliefs. Some may find the idea of living with fewer possessions and experiencing contentment without material wealth inspiring and appealing.

In this world, the concept of traditional ownership has been fundamentally altered, possibly due to the rise of advanced technology, resource distribution systems, or a shift in societal values. In this new world, personal belongings are no longer a measure of status or success. The focus is instead placed on experiences, personal connections, and a sense of community. Material goods are primarily shared or accessed through a shared economy or collaborative networks, where people can utilize items on-demand without needing to physically own them. The shift towards non-ownership is likely accompanied by advancements in technology, such as virtual reality or augmented reality, that allow people to access and experience a wide range of products and services without physical ownership. This could include virtual ownership of homes, vehicles, entertainment systems, and even consumer goods. The elimination of personal ownership may also have economic implications, where goods and services are provided by centralized entities or automated systems, ensuring equitable distribution and reducing waste. This may result in a more resource-efficient society with reduced environmental impact, as products are designed to be shared, reused, and recycled. In terms of personal happiness, the emphasis shifts from material acquisition to personal growth, self-improvement, and interpersonal relationships. People find fulfillment in enriching experiences, whether it be through travel, education, or pursuing hobbies. With the reduction in ownership-related worries and the sharing culture, individuals may feel a greater sense of freedom, reduced stress, and improved mental well-being. However, challenges may arise in terms of privacy, security, and individuality in a world where everything is shared or accessed through a centralized system. The loss of personal ownership may also challenge traditional notions of identity and expression, as people's possessions and lifestyle choices no longer serve as markers of individuality. In conclusion, the world associated with \\"You will own nothing, you will be happy\\" presents a future where the significance of personal ownership is diminished, replaced by a focus on shared access, experiential fulfillment, and community collaboration. While this vision may offer benefits such as reduced material consumption and increased well-being, it also raises questions and potential challenges regarding privacy, security, and individuality."},{"instruction":"Describe world associated with \\"You will have everything you want for free\\"","output":"The world associated with the phrase \\"You will have everything you want for free\\" envisions a society where all goods, services, and resources are readily available without any monetary exchange.

However, challenges may arise regarding the sustainability and resource management of such a system. Ensuring fair and equitable distribution of resources, preventing abuse or overconsumption, and maintaining a balance between individual desires and the collective good may require careful planning and governance. Additionally, the absence of a traditional economic system based on exchange and value may impact the incentive structure and innovation. Without the drive for profit, it is crucial to incentivize creativity, research, and development, as well as the maintenance and improvement of the systems that facilitate abundance. In conclusion, the world associated with \\"You will have everything you want for free\\" depicts a society where resources and desires are abundantly available without any financial barriers. While such a concept offers the potential for unparalleled individual fulfillment and societal cooperation, challenges related to sustainability, governance, and innovation also need to be addressed to ensure the long-term viability of such a society."},{"instruction":"Describe opposite world associated with \\"You will own nothing you will be happy\\"","output":"The opposite world associated with the phrase \\"You will own nothing, you will be happy\\" presents a society where personal ownership and material possessions hold utmost importance in determining one's happiness and social status. In this world, the accumulation of wealth, assets, and possessions is seen as the ultimate goal and measure of success. In this world, personal belongings become a source of pride, identity, and status. The more one owns, the higher their social standing and perceived success. The emphasis is placed on acquiring and displaying luxurious and exclusive items, such as extravagant mansions, expensive vehicles, designer clothing, and rare collectibles. The focus on ownership creates a highly competitive and materialistic society, where individuals constantly strive to outdo one another in acquiring even more opulent possessions. The pursuit of wealth becomes the primary driver of motivation, often leading to cutthroat competition, relentless work ethic, and an increased divide between the haves and have-nots. The availability of goods and services is heavily reliant on one's financial standing. Access to quality healthcare, education, and even basic necessities may be restricted to those who can afford them. Social inequalities and disparities become more pronounced, exacerbating the divide between the rich and the poor. Despite the emphasis on ownership, happiness in this world can become elusive and shallow. Individuals may find that the pursuit of material possessions does not bring lasting fulfillment, and they may suffer from loneliness, stress, and a constant need for validation through their possessions. The pursuit of material wealth often takes precedence over personal well-being, relationships, and experiences that bring genuine happiness. Additionally, the excessive consumption and importance placed on material possessions in this world may lead to environmental degradation and unsustainability. Resources are exploited and wasted at an alarming rate, further exacerbating the negative impacts on the planet. In conclusion, the opposite world associated with \\"You will own nothing, you will be happy\\" presents a society where the ownership of material possessions is paramount and defines one's happiness and social status. This world fosters a highly competitive and materialistic culture, leading to social inequalities, shallow happiness, and environmental degradation."},{"instruction":"Describe world associated with \\"You will have everything you want for free\\"","output":"In a world where you have everything you want for free, abundance reigns supreme.

This world is governed by a powerful centralized authority that enforces strict control over all aspects of individuals' lives in the name of creating a homogeneous and equitable society. In this bleak reality, every individual is assigned a minimalistic living space, devoid of personal items or sentimental objects. The idea behind this is to eliminate class distinctions and ensure equality among citizens. However, this also means that people have no means to express their individuality or establish a sense of place and belonging. They are merely cogs in a vast, uniform system. The central authority controls all resources and materials, ensuring that everything is shared collectively. This includes basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter, which are all provided by the state. While this might initially sound equitable, the lack of personal choice or control over one's own possessions instills a sense of powerlessness and dependency on the ruling regime. In this dystopian world, personal ambition and striving for economic success are discouraged. The pursuit of wealth is deemed unnecessary, as everyone is expected to find contentment in their meager existence. Creativity is stifled, as artistic expression and entrepreneurial endeavors are heavily regulated or even banned altogether. Individuality and free thought are suppressed, as any dissent or deviation from the norm is met with severe consequences. Surveillance is pervasive, with constant monitoring and control ensuring adherence to societal norms and rules. The central authority maintains a stranglehold over information, suppressing alternative viewpoints and manipulating public opinion. While the ruling regime promises happiness amidst this restricted existence, the happiness is ultimately manufactured, superficial, and forced upon the citizens through psychological manipulation and suppressive measures. Any dissatisfaction or desire for personal belongings is viewed as a threat to the harmonious facade imposed by the ruling authority. In this dystopian world, the absence of personal ownership and the denial of individual expression creates a society stripped of its humanity. People become mere shells, conforming to the prescribed norms and lacking the agency to shape their own lives. The absence of personal belongings and the suppression of individuality lead to a controlled and Orwellian existence, where the pursuit of true happiness is replaced by a fabricated illusion."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

E[X])(Y - E[Y])] ] 这里的 ( E ) 表示期望值，这个公式基本上是在计算两个随机变量相对于其各自均值的偏差的乘积的期望值。 计算机科学中的协方差: 计算机科学中，协方差常用于数据分析、模式识别和信号处理领域，特别是在机器学习和统计学习中具有重要应用。它可以用于特征选择、降维（如主成分分析，PCA）以及构建多变量概率模型等。 例如，在主成分分析（PCA）中，协方差矩阵被用来找出数据中的主要变量，以便将多维度的数据降低到更低的维度，同时尽量保留原始数据的特征。这种技术广泛应用于图像处理、语音识别和金融数据分析等领域。 另外，协方差也可以用于构建多元正态分布模型，这在概率论和统计领域非常重要。多元正态分布的密度函数中，协方差矩阵决定了分布形态的形状、尺寸和方向。 协方差的应用: 1. 金融: 在投资组合理论中，协方差用于衡量不同金融资产回报率之间的关系，帮助决定如何通过分散投资来最小化风险。 2. 数据科学: 用于特征分析和选择。如果两个特征之间的协方差很高，可能就意味着它们包含相似的信息，可以考虑删除其中一个以减少数据的维数。 3. 机器学习: 在监督学习任务中，协方差可用于理解不同特征和输出变量之间的关系，帮助改进模型的性能。 4. 图像处理: 在图像识别和分类任务中，人们可以利用像素间的协方差来提取纹理和形状特征。 因此，协方差不仅是一个描述两个变量关系的统计量，而且它在多个领域中都有着实际的应用价值，是数据分析和信号处理的一个重要工具。"},{"instruction":"现在有没有一些视频分类的方法，视频时常大约在2分钟左右的","output":"视频分类是计算机视觉和机器学习领域的一个活跃研究方向。对于时长约2分钟的视频，视频分类任务通常涉及到识别视频内容的主题或类别，例如区分运动视频、电影片段或教学视频等。目前存在一些效果较好的视频分类方法，这些方法利用了深度学习的技术来提取和学习视频中的特征。以下列出了一些常见的视频分类技术： 1. 基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的方法: 卷积神经网络主要适用于静态图像的处理。在视频分类中，可以将CNN用于从视频帧中提取特征。每一帧都被看作是一个独立的图像，CNN可以从中提取空间特征。 2. 基于递归神经网络（RNN）的方法: 给定从CNN提取的帧特征，可以使用递归神经网络，特别是其变体如长短时记忆网络（LSTM）或门控循环单元（GRU），来学习时间序列中的动态特征。这些模型能够捕捉到视频中的时间上下文信息。 3. 基于三维卷积神经网络（3D CNN）的方法: 三维卷积神经网络可以同时提取视频序列中的空间和时间特征。通过引入时间维度的卷积层，3D CNN能够更好地捕捉视频内容随时间的变化。 4. 基于双流（Two-Stream）网络的方法: 双流网络有一个空间流（Spatial Stream）和一个时间流（Temporal Stream）。空间流分析静态视觉信息，而时间流则分析物体在帧之间的运动信息（通常使用光流图来表示）。然后将这两个网络的输出结合起来进行分类。 5. 基于时间分割网络（TSN）的方法: 时间分割网络是一种有效的长视频分类框架。它将视频分割成几个段，并从每个段中随机选择一个短的连续帧序列。通过对这些短序列进行处理和整合，TSN能够学习并理解整个视频的内容。 6. Transformer模型: 近年来，Transformer模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中取得了一系列成功。在视频分类中，基于Transformer的模型如ViT（Vision Transformer）和TimeSformer也被探索用以捕捉视频数据中复杂的时空依赖关系。 这些方法通常结合了预处理（例如视频分割和光流估计）、深度学习模型的训练以及后处理（例如投票机制或融合策略）。选择哪种方法取决于具体的应用场景、计算资源和所需的准确率。随着研究的进展，也会出现新的模型和方法来解决视频分类的问题。不过，得益于深度学习框架如TensorFlow、PyTorch的发展，即使对于非专家用户而言，实现这些先进的视频分类方法也变得越来越容易。"},{"instruction":"你上面提到的这些模型 大多数只能应用于较短时间的视频分类任务吧 比如在UCF101和Kinects400上，但是我这里想要的是2分钟这种比较长时间的视频分类，还可以用哪些方法呢","output":"对于较长的视频，例如持续时间约2分钟的视频，直接应用传统的短视频分类方法可能会遇到一些挑战，如计算成本高，难以捕获长期依赖关系等。对于这样的长视频，可以采用一些特定的策略和方法来改善视频分类的效果。以下是一些建议： 1. 分割与融合（Segment and Combine）: - 将长视频分割成较短的片段或帧序列。 - 对每个片段独立地使用上述提及的方法（如3D CNN、LSTM等）进行特征提取。 - 使用一个融合策略（例如，投票、平均、加权融合或通过另一个网络层）将各个片段的输出结果结合起来以得出最终分类结果。 2. 多尺度时间采样（Multi-scale Temporal Sampling）: - 在不同的时间尺度上采样视频片段，捕获不同时间粒度上的信息。 - 从长期至短期的行为都可以被模型学习。 3. 注意力机制（Attention Mechanism）: - 在LSTM或Transformer模型中使用注意力机制，允许模型自适应地关注视频中最相关的部分。 - 注意力模型特别适合于捕捉长期依赖和关键事件，有助于提升长视频的分析性能。 4. 特征层次融合（Hierarchical Feature Fusion）: - 利用不同层次（如帧级、场景级、片段级）的特征并进行融合，以捕获视频内容的多个层次细节。 - 这种融合方法可以帮助模型理解视频中的复杂结构。 5. 弱监督学习或自监督学习: - 对于长视频，标注困难且耗时。可以采用弱监督学习，只使用部分标注数据进行学习。 - 自监督学习可以充分利用非标记数据，通过设计伪任务（pretext task）提取强大的表征。 6. 多模态分析（Multi-modal Analysis）: - 除了视频的视觉内容，还可以结合其他模态的信息，如音频、文本（如字幕或描述）和元数据，以提供更多的上下文信息。 - 多模态分析有助于提高模型对视频内容的整体理解。 为了处理长视频，设计有效的抽样、特征提取和时间序列分析技术非常关键。此外，硬件和计算资源的限制也可能成为考虑因素，因为长视频的处理通常需要更多的存储和计算能力。在实践中可能需要对不同的方法进行实验，并找到最佳的解决方案，以在保证准确率的同时实现高效的视频处理。"},{"instruction":"我描述的不太准确，其实我想的是将这2分钟的视频拆成多个片段且每个片段进行分类，比如我拍摄的是套房子的视频，我需要正确拆分出每个房间的视频片段并且输出片段属于哪个房间类型，这种有什么好的方法呢","output":"根据您的描述，您需要的是一种视频分割（segmentation）加上场景识别（scene recognition）的方法。视频需要被正确地拆分成不同的房间片段，每个片段需要被分类为属于特定的房间类型（例如，厨房、卧室、浴室等）。以下是应对这一任务的几个步骤和相应的方法： 1. 视频分割（Temporal Segmentation）: 这个步骤旨在将视频中连续的房间场景分割开。可以使用以下几种技术： - **变化检测（Change Detection）**: 通过比较连续帧的视觉特征差异来检测场景变化。差异显著的点可能是场景变更的界限。 - **基于深度学习的方法**: 使用3D CNN或LSTM等模型来预测何时视频中的场景发生了变化。例如，定义场景转换预测为一个二分类问题，训练模型识别房间转换的边界。 - **基于光流的方法**: 分析帧间的光流特征来检测运动的不连续性，这种不连续性有可能暗示场景的改变。 2. 特征提取（Feature Extraction）: 每个分割的片段都会进行特征提取，该步骤可使用以下技术： - **卷积神经网络（CNN）**: 使用预训练的CNN模型（如ResNet, VGG等）来提取每个片段的视觉特征。 - **多尺度特征提取**: 考虑不同尺度的特征（例如局部特征和全局特征）以更好地描述房间场景。 3. 分类（Classification）: 提取到的特征被用于分类模型来预测片段属于哪种房间类型。 - **支持向量机（SVM）**: 使用SVM等传统机器学习算法进行特征向量的分类。 - **深度学习模型**: 使用如CNN, RNN, Transformer等深度学习模型直接从数据中学习分类边界。 4. 模型融合（Model Ensemble）: 结合多个模型的预测结果，以提高整体分类的精度。通过投票、加权平均或更复杂的融合技术来整合不同模型的预测。 5. 后处理（Post-processing）: 在模型预测之后，可以进行一些后处理步骤以进一步提高分类精度，例如： - **平滑处理**: 对连续片段的预测分类进行平滑处理，以避免频繁的类别跳变。 - **场景逻辑关系**: 利用房间之间的逻辑关系（如餐厅通常紧邻厨房）来修正不合理的分类结果。 这个任务的挑战在于正确地进行视频分割，并在之后准确地识别每一个房间的类别。对于房间分类，可以额外利用房间的装饰风格、家具布局和其他区分特征。在某些情况下，也可以利用音频信号作为辅助信息来增加识别准确度。需要注意的是，你可能需要为你的特定任务收集一个带标注的数据集来训练你的模型，因为现有的数据集可能与你的应用场景不匹配。"},{"instruction":"我在想能不能通过一个模型来做到直接出分段和分类呢，比如利用GPT这种自回归的模型","output":"使用一个模型同时进行视频分段和分类是一种具有挑战性的任务，因为它要求模型具备对视频内容的深入理解以及对时序结构的捕捉能力。即使是自回归模型如GPT，在视频处理领域也面临挑战，由于视频数据的维度非常高，直接应用于视频可能会遇到计算和存储上的瓶颈。 尽管如此，有些研究工作试图将类似于GPT的自回归模型应用于视频理解任务，特别是在条件自回归模型（例如使用编解码器架构）的上下文中，可以将编码器用于视频的特征提取，然后利用解码器进行顺序预测。 下面是几种可能适用的模型和方法： 1. 序列到序列（Seq2Seq）模型： - 可以使用编解码器架构来处理视频数据，其中编码器负责编码视频特征，解码器负责预测输出序列。 - 输出序列可以是视频分段的界限位置和相应的分类标签，可以用特殊的分隔符来分开不同片段的标签。 2. Transformer模型： - VideoBERT和Cognitive Transformer等模型在视频域中利用了BERT和Transformer的结构，以尝试同时捕获视频的时空特征。 - 它们通常将视频分割为短的片段或帧序列，并将其转化为一个半监督学习的任务。 3. 端到端可微分模型： - 设计一个端到端的模型，可以整合视频分割和分类任务，通过训练策略使模型在一个统一的框架下优化。 - 使用可微分的分割机制（例如Soft Window或Attention Masking），可以在模型内部实现视频分段。 4. 自监督学习： - 减少人工标注需求，可以通过自我监督任务预训练模型学习有效特征，并在下游任务中微调以实现视频分段和分类。 请注意，虽然上述方法理论上可行，但在实际中要取得良好的性能可能需要大量的工程努力和资源投入。此外，GPT和Transformer模型原生是用于处理文本数据的，直接应用在视频数据上通常需要重大的模型改造和复杂的预处理步骤。实际实施时可能还会遇到计算资源和模型扩展性等问题，需仔细考虑和调整。 在任何情况下，您都需要一个合适的数据集来训练您的模型。这意味着您需要有带有清晰分界的房间视频片段以及对应的分类标签，这样模型才能学习如何正确地进行视频分段和分类。如果这样的数据集不可用，您可能需要自己创建一个，这本身也是一个不小的挑战。"},{"instruction":"我是这样想的，你看看行不行。比如对于一段时长60s的视频，1-10s是客厅，那么我的标签就是['bos', 'living room','living room','living room','living room','living room','living room','living room','living room','eos'],然后紧接着5秒是卫生间，标注制作成['bos', 'wc, 'wc', 'wc', 'eos'],这样训练数据和标签就都有了。我要做的就是autoregress的方式去预测每个图片对应的token","output":"您的思路是将视频分类和分割问题转化为一个类似于语言建模的任务，通过自回归的方式逐帧（或逐片段）生成标签序列。这种方法与自然语言处理中的序列生成任务有一定的相似性，尤其类似于机器翻译或文本摘要生成等任务。使用这种方法，在理论上是可行的。以下是基于您的思路实施解决方案时可能要考虑的几个步骤： 1. 预处理视频： - 将视频分割成帧序列或固定时间长度的片段。 - 对每帧（或片段）使用CNN之类的模型提取特征。 2. 数据标注： - 根据视频内容创建标签序列，如您所述，对于每个房间的展示，生成一个以'start of sequence' (bos) 开头并以'end of sequence' (eos) 结束的房间标签序列。 3. 模型设计： - 构建一个自回归模型（如基于Transformer的架构），该模型预测给定当前已生成序列的下一标签。 - 模型的输入可能是前一帧（或片段）的特征和当前生成的标签序列。 4. 训练模型： - 使用自回归训练模式，学习根据视频内容逐帧生成标签序列。 5. 推理（Inference）过程： - 从序列的开始（bos）开始，模型逐步预测下一个标签，直到序列的结束（eos）。 当使用这种方法时，请注意以下几点： - 模型应该能够捕捉时间序列的依赖关系，以便学习识别房间类型的变化点。 - 这种方法假设视频在不同房间间转换是明显且有序的，因此可能需要额外的方法来处理房间转换的边界情况。 - 数据的连贯性和一致性是这种方法能否成功的关键。模型的性能将强烈依赖于数据的质量和标注的准确性。 - 因为采用逐步预测方式生成标签，这种方法的计算效率可能会受限于序列长度。短片段可能表现得更好，因为预测每个片段的标签可能更快并且可能减少误差传播。 总之，将视频分割和分类问题转化为一个序列生成任务是一个有趣且富有创意的方法。但实际实施起来可能会遇到上述问题以及其他非预见的挑战。这种方法的效果和效率可能需要通过构建原型和实验来评估，并可能需要对模型结构和训练流程进行调整和优化。"},{"instruction":"但是我这儿有个问题是 我训练和预测阶段的输入分别是什么。 预测应该就是整个视频了 然后它要输出多个['bos', 'type', 'eos']这样的东西，训练的输入是什么呢","output":"对于您所提出的这种基于自回归模型进行视频分割和分类的方法，训练和预测阶段的输入略有不同，但是都建立在相似的理念上。以下是详细解释： # 训练阶段： **输入**: - 视频被分割成一系列帧或者固定长度的片段。 - 对于每个片段，您需要提供视频特征（可以通过预训练的CNN提取）以及对应的标签序列。标签序列根据每个片段的房间类型事先标注好，并按照您的设计包含['bos', '房间类型', ..., 'eos']格式。其中，'...'代表该片段中房间类型重复多次，以序列长度作为约束。 **目标**: - 模型的目标是学习在给定前一帧（或片段）的视觉特征和当前已生成的标签序列的情况下，预测下一个标签（房间类型或'eos'）。 在训练时，您通常会使用教师强制（teacher forcing）的机制，即在时间步t使用真实的标签作为下一时间步t+1的输入，而不是使用模型在时间步t上的预测输出。 # 预测阶段（推理）： **输入**: - 对于要进行分类和分割的完整视频，您仍然可以分割成帧或片段，然后提取视觉特征。 **处理过程**: - 开始时，您将模型初始化为一个空序列或仅包含['bos']的序列。 - 然后，模型会开始逐步生成每个新片段的标签，一直到预测出['eos']标志为止。 - 对于每一步预测，模型都依赖于先前预测的标签序列和视频片段的视觉特征。 **输出**: - 模型的输出将是一个序列，该序列代表了视频中各个片段的标签，理想情况下应该反映视频内内容的结构，就像在标注的数据中那样。 建议您为序列模型的预测建立一个机制，确保['eos']标志后，模型能重新启动并寻找下一个['bos']的开始，从而可以连续不断地处理整个视频中的多个房间片段。 需要注意的是，尽管这种方法概念上是可行的，但在实际应用中可能需要进行多次迭代和调优，包括确定合适的片段长度、选择适当的特征提取方法、调整模型结构，以及解决可能的过拟合或类别不平衡问题等。此外，这种方法要求高准确度的标注，因为任何标注的偏差在自回归模型中都可能积累并导致较大偏差。"},{"instruction":"For instance, a deep learning lecture series, a famous movie, or a public address to the nation, if translated to desired target languages, can become accessible to millions of new viewers. 将这段翻译成中文","output":"例如，如果将深度学习讲座系列、一部著名电影或者国家公开演讲翻译成目标语言，就能让数以百万计的新观众获得观看的机会。"},{"instruction":"We start by inspecting the existing speaker-independent ap- proaches for speech to lip generation.

They are not trained on a small set of identities or a small vocabulary. This allows them to, at test time, lip-sync random identities for any speech. To the best of our knowledge, only two such prominent works [17, 18] exist in the current literature. Note that [17] is an extended version of [7]. Both these works [17, 18] formulate the task of learning to lip-sync in the wild as follows: Given a short speech segment S and a random reference face image R, the task of the network is to generate a lip-synced version Lдof the input face that matches the audio. Additionally, the LipGAN model also inputs the target face with bottom-half masked to act as a pose prior. This was crucial as it allowed the generated face crops to be seamlessly pasted back into the original video without further post-processing. It also trains a discriminator in conjunction with the generator to discriminate in-sync or out-of-sync audio-video pairs. Both these works, however, suffer from a significant limitation: they work very well on static images of arbitrary identities but produce inaccurate lip generation when trying to lip-sync unconstrained videos in the wild. In contrast to the GAN setup used in LipGAN [18], we use a pre-trained, accurate lip-sync discriminator that is not trained further with the generator. We observe that this is an important design choice to achieve much better lip-sync results.将这段话翻译成中文","output":"尽管在语音驱动面部生成方面的研究数量有所增加，但令人惊讶的是，很少有工作被设计用来为任意身份、声音和语言的视频进行口型同步。它们没有只在一小部分身份或有限词汇上进行训练。这使得它们在测试时可以为任何语音的随机身份进行口型同步。据我们所知，在现有文献中只有两项这样的重点研究[17, 18]。请注意，[17]是[7]的扩展版本。这两项研究[17, 18]将在野外学习口型同步的任务定义如下：给定一个短的语音片段S和一个随机的参考面部图像R，网络的任务是生成一个与音频匹配的同步口型版本Lд的输入面部。此外，LipGAN模型还输入目标面部，其下半部分被遮盖，以便作为姿态先验。这一点至关重要，因为它使得生成的面部剪裁能够无缝粘贴回原始视频中，无需进一步的后期处理。它还训练了一个与生成器共同工作的鉴别器，来鉴别同步或不同步的音视频对。然而，这两项工作都存在一个显著的限制：它们在静态图像任意身份上表现得非常好，但在尝试为野外视频进行不受约束的口型同步时，会产生不准确的唇形生成。与在LipGAN [18]中使用的GAN设置不同，我们使用了一个预训练的、精确的口型同步鉴别器，该鉴别器没有与生成器进一步训练。我们观察到这是一个重要的设计选择，以达到更好的口型同步效果。"},{"instruction":"he face reconstruction loss is computed for the whole image, to ensure correct pose generation, preservation of identity, and even background around the face. The lip region corresponds to less than 4% of the total reconstruction loss (based on the spatial extent), so a lot of surrounding image reconstruction is first optimized before the network starts to perform fine-grained lip shape correction. This is further supported by the fact that the network begins morphing lips only at around half-way (≈ 11th epoch) through its training process (≈ 20 epochs [18]).

Secondly, the generated images during training contain a lot of artifacts due to the large scale and pose variations. We argue that training the discriminator in a GAN setup on these noisy generated images, as done in LipGAN, results in the discriminator focusing on the visual artifacts instead of the audio-lip correspondence.

The pertinent part of the traceback is: \`\`\`plaintext json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Unterminated string starting at: line 1 column 63 (char 62) \`\`\` This error is caused by trying to decode a JSON string that is not properly formatted -- specifically, it has an unterminated string. This means that somewhere in the JSON data there is an opening quote that is not properly closed with a corresponding closing quote. To solve this issue, you'll want to carefully check the JSON string that you're attempting to decode. It's quite possible that the JSON data is being truncated or corrupted before it reaches the JSON decoding function \`json.loads(obj)\`. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and fix the problem: 1. **Inspect the JSON String**: Print out the entire JSON string (\`obj\`) before you call \`json.loads(obj)\` to verify that it is complete and correctly formatted. 2. **Check for Special Characters**: Ensure that there's no accidental inclusion of special characters like newline (\`n\`), carriage return (\`r\`), or other control characters inside the JSON string which could be causing the problem. 3. **Check for Concatenation Issues**: If the JSON string is being constructed from multiple parts, make sure that all parts are concatenated correctly and that no parts are missing. 4. **Validate JSON Externally**: Use an external JSON validator tool to check if the JSON is valid. You can copy and paste the printed JSON string into a tool such as [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate it. 5. **Review Data Sources**: If the JSON comes from an external source, ensure that the data is being received completely and not cut off mid-transmission. 6. **Logging and Error Handling**: Add error handling around the \`json.loads(obj)\` call that catches \`JSONDecodeError\` and logs relevant information to help debug what part of the string is causing the issue. Once you identify where the problem with the JSON string is occurring, you'll be able to correct the issue at the source, whether that means fixing the transmission of the data, repairing the concatenation logic, or handling special characters appropriately."},{"instruction":"Напиши мне скрипт на PoweShell для подсчёта кол-во компьютеров в указанном мной каталоге в ActiveDirectory","output":"Чтобы написать скрипт подсчета количества компьютеров в конкретном каталоге Active Directory с использованием PowerShell, прежде всего удостоверьтесь, что у вас есть соответствующие права доступа в AD для выполнения этой операции и установлены необходимые модули для работы с AD в PowerShell (RSAT-AD-PowerShell).

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Can u write a story?","output":"Of course! Here's a short story for you: Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between rolling hills and a crystal-clear lake, there was a curious young girl named Lily. She had bright green eyes, a cascade of chestnut hair, and a spirit that longed for adventure beyond the well-trodden paths of her homeland. Lily's heart was particularly enchanted by the tales of an ancient tree that stood at the very heart of the Enchanted Forest, which bordered her village. The Great Harmony Tree, as the villagers called it, was said to be a source of untold magic and wisdom. Its leaves shimmered in the sunlight with mesmerizing hues of gold and silver, and it bore fruit only once every century. The legend claimed that whoever tasted its fruit would gain knowledge and insight as vast as the sky itself. Despite the warnings of her elders, who cautioned that the forest was woven with puzzles and perils, Lily's desire to see the Great Harmony Tree grew with each passing day. On the morning of her sixteenth birthday, she woke to find the air filled with a sweet, almost singing breeze that seemed to call her name. She knew in her heart that this was the day to set out on her quest. Equipped with a small satchel of provisions and her favorite book of lore to guide her, Lily made her way into the Enchanted Forest. The dense canopy of the trees whispered secrets in the wind, and sunlight flitted through the leaves in playful patterns, guiding her deeper into the woodland realm. As the day waned, the cheerful chirping of the birds was replaced by an eerie silence, and Lily realized she had wandered into the domain of the Wisps—phantasmal lights that led travelers astray. Remembering the verses from her book, she closed her eyes and whispered a charm of truth. When she opened her eyes, the deceitful glow of the Wisps had faded, revealing a moonlit grove that led her back to the true path. The journey was arduous, testing Lily's courage and resolve. She navigated mazes of thorns, conversed with cryptic owls, and even danced with the fleeting shadows at the whim of the capricious forest. With each challenge she faced, Lily's connection to the land grew stronger, and her heart filled with the silent songs of nature. Finally, bathed in the light of a silvery full moon, Lily emerged into a clearing where stood the Great Harmony Tree. Its presence was overwhelming, its beauty beyond words. Gently, as if acknowledging her determination and pure heart, the tree offered her its centennial gift: a single, glowing fruit. As Lily reached out and took the fruit in her hands, warmth flooded through her, and her eyes were filled with visions of ages past and wonders yet to come. Knowledge sprouted within her like a wellspring, revealing the interwoven dance of all things. Years later, Lily would return to her village, not as a wandering dreamer, but as a sage whose wisdom nurtured her people and the land they called home. And it was said that beneath the boughs of the Great Harmony Tree, a new sapling had begun to grow, a testament to the curious young girl who had sought the heart of the forest and found her own.

The videos may vary, but the template is very much the same. On top of the video itself are captions where a Muslim's friend, who is also Muslim, will claim that they are devout and faithful. The next caption will then say, \\"Also him:\\", with the video on the bottom being of random people mixing multiple alcoholic beverages to create strong cocktails. The implication being that their friend, despite their insistence of being devout, will, at a moment's notice, begin drinking alcohol, considered haram in Islam, especially at parties. The videos are common among younger Muslims, who use it to poke fun at their own friends' alcohol enjoyment. Comments would range from \\"Yeah, that's my friend\\" to \\"How shameful (I am that person\\", implying that they themselves humorously like alcohol while pretending to have a moral high ground in a sort of contradictory humor.","output":"Title: \\"Hidden Revelations\\" Ibrahim couldn't contain his laughter as he scrolled through his social media feed, coming across yet another one of those videos. The trend had gained immense popularity within Muslim communities online, particularly among the younger generation. It was a unique way for them to address a social paradox that often accompanied their lives - the struggle between adhering to their faith and indulging in certain forbidden pleasures. The videos followed a consistent template: a split-screen format with captions overlaid on top. On one side, a Muslim would confidently proclaim their devoutness, emphasizing their faithfulness and dedication to their religious duties. On the other side, a video clip would play, depicting the same person gleefully mixing colorful and enticing alcoholic cocktails. The contradiction was clear, as alcohol was strictly prohibited in Islam. These short videos captured the essence of an unspoken truth within the Muslim community – the undeniable existence of a hidden world, where people enjoyed the forbidden, yet pretended otherwise. It was a humorous way to openly acknowledge the complexities of navigating their faith and personal desires. The comments section beneath each video was a mix of lighthearted banter and self-deprecating humor. Some would tag their friends, jokingly admitting, \\"Yep, that's exactly you!\\" Others would comment with a touch of irony, saying, \\"How shameful I am that person,\\" hinting at their own hidden enjoyment of alcohol while maintaining a moral facade. Ahmed, one of the creators behind this trend, saw it as a way to encourage open discussions around a subject that was often shrouded in silence. \\"The videos act as a release valve, allowing us to poke fun at ourselves and our contradictions within a safe and relatable context,\\" he explained. However, as the trend gained popularity, it sparked a series of debates among the wider Muslim community. Some believed it was disrespectful to joke about something as serious as maintaining one's faith, while others argued for the need to address these contradictions openly, rather than pretending they didn't exist. Regardless of the ongoing debate, the trend continued to thrive and served as a unique form of self-expression. It allowed young Muslims to navigate the complexities of their own lives while simultaneously breaking down the stereotypes that surrounded them. The videos fostered a sense of unity, reminding everyone that they were not alone in their struggles to balance faith and desires. Over time, more variations of the videos emerged, each highlighting different aspects of Muslim life. Some showcased individuals secretly indulging in romantic relationships they would never openly admit to, while others focused on individuals sneaking bites of pork when nobody was watching. The videos transcended the initial topic of alcohol, capturing the multifaceted nature of living within a religious community.

创建不同精度的张量 tensor_float32 = torch.tensor([1.0], dtype=torch.float32) # 单精度 tensor_float64 = torch.tensor([1.0], dtype=torch.float64) # 双精度 \`\`\` 2. **控制中间结果的精度**： - 在进行多步计算时，尽量避免使用低精度数据类型储存中间结果，因为误差可能会累积。 - 为了确保结果的准确性，可以在计算中间步骤时使用高精度的数据类型，最后再将结果转换为所需的精度。 3. **使用确定性算法**： - PyTorch提供了一些选项来使用确定性算法，特别是在卷积运算和其他需要多线程加速的操作中。 - 设置\`torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True\`可以使得CUDA在支持的操作上使用确定性算法，尽管这可能降低计算效率。 4. **数值稳定性的技巧**： - 在数值计算中使用一些技巧来显著减少舍入误差的影响，例如使用复合函数（如\`logsumexp\`）或者添加小的偏移量来避免除零错误。 5. **避免可避免的累积舍入误差**： - 比如，避免在每次迭代中累加一个非常小的数值变化；相反，可以积累到一定程度后一起更新。 最后，永远需要记住的是，所有的浮点数运算都是近似的，不会像整数运算一样精确。由于浮点数的表示只能容纳有限数量的有效数字，所以总是存在舍入误差。在设计算法时考虑这些误差，以确保算法具有数值稳定性。通过上述建议，可以在不同程度上控制和减少舍入误差的影响。"},{"instruction":"grad_fn=<SelectBackward> 什么意思","output":"在PyTorch中，\`grad_fn\`属性是指与张量相关的梯度函数，它表示了创建该张量的操作（如果有的话）。换句话说，\`grad_fn\`记录了张量的计算历史，用于在进行自动微分时回溯计算图并计算梯度。 当你看到一个张量的\`grad_fn\`显示为 \`<SelectBackward>\` 时，它表示这个张量是通过选择操作（如使用\`index_select\`函数或简单的索引操作）从一个更大的张量中得到的。\`SelectBackward\`是这个选择操作的反向传播函数，当你对结果张量调用\`.backward()\`进行梯度计算时，它会被用来计算原始张量相应位置的梯度。 举个例子，当你执行如下操作时： \`\`\`python import torch # 创建一个张量，requires_grad=True告知PyTorch需要跟踪梯度 x = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True) # 选择一个元素 y = x[2] # 查看y print(y.grad_fn) \`\`\` 如果\`x[2]\`不是一个标量，打印\`y.grad_fn\`将会得到\`<SelectBackward>\`，因为\`y\`是通过对\`x\`进行索引操作得到的。至于为什么它的梯度函数叫做\`SelectBackward\`而不是\`IndexBackward\`或其他的名字，这只是PyTorch命名的习惯。 如果你执行\`y.backward()\`，PyTorch将自动计算梯度，并将这些梯度存储在创建\`y\`的输入张量\`x\`的\`.grad\`属性中。由于\`y\`是通过从\`x\`中选择一个特定元素得到的，所以在反向传播时只有选择的元素的位置会得到梯度（即\`x[2].grad\`将不为零），其它位置的梯度为零。 要注意的是，PyTorch通常只允许对标量（单个数值）执行\`backward()\`操作，这是因为需要得到关于该标量的梯度。如果要对非标量张量\`y\`调用\`backward()\`，需要传递一个与\`y\`形状相同的梯度张量作为参数，指示如何对\`y\`中的每个元素进行权重。"},{"instruction":"pytorch如何打印tensor是不是在cuda上","output":"在PyTorch中，你可以使用 \`.device\` 属性来检查Tensor存储在哪个设备上。如果Tensor在GPU上，则其设备类型为\`'cuda'\`；如果在CPU上，则为\`'cpu'\`。 下面是一个Python代码示例，展示如何检查Tensor是否在CUDA上，以及如何打印这一信息： \`\`\`python import torch #

行李箱尺寸： 对于一周的旅行，一个中型（24-26寸）到大型（28-32寸）的行李箱应该足够。你可能需要额外的空间来放置冬季的衣物，因为这些衣物通常更加厚重。同时，考虑是否需要携带额外的装备，如相机包或特殊装备的包（如登山靴）。请记住航空公司的行李规定，保证不超重。 # 针对香港出发补充计划： - 出发前考虑天气对比：香港与冰岛气温差异大，出发时注意多层穿着，方便在机场和飞机中适配两地的温差。 - 考虑航班总时长和中途转机时间，准备好长途飞行必需品，比如睡眠眼罩、颈枕和护耳塞。 - 确认签证和旅行保险：持中国护照前往冰岛（申根区成员国）需办理申根签证，同时建议购买旅行保险以应对不预期事件。 - 货币兑换：在香港兑换一些冰岛克朗，以备小额支付之需；冰岛大多数地方接受信用卡。 准备充分是保证旅行顺利的关键，因此在出发前一定要检查并准备好上述所有必需品。预祝您从香港出发到冰岛的旅程愉快、安全且难忘！"},{"instruction":"这个计划里面从香港到冰岛要多长时间？你的7天计划把这个考虑进去了么？需不需要再核实调整一下？","output":"从香港到冰岛通常需要包括至少一次中转的长途飞行，总的行程时间一般在15到20个小时左右，具体时间取决于中转等待时间和选择的航班。假设您选择的是早上从香港出发，考虑到时差（冰岛比香港晚8小时），即使包括中转时间，也有可能在当天晚上抵达冰岛。 我假设您的行程第一天是在到达冰岛后的休息和适应，所以不需要对7天行程进行调整，但确实需要考虑航班和时差对您体力和行程第二天的影响。 强烈推荐在确定行程前，提前查看具体的航班信息，并考虑下面几点重新评估行程： 1. **第一天的活动可能需要调整**，如果您抵达的时间较晚或您感到特别疲劳，可能需要在酒店休息，省去当天的市区游览。 2. **第二天可以预留更多时间进行休息**，特别是如果您在抵达当天晚上安排了观看极光的活动。 3. **中途转机时间**，有时候较长的转机时间会使得整体行程更加漫长，值得考虑在行程设计中预留出一定的灵活时间。 4. **时差影响**，从香港出发可能会有较大的时差。虽然冰岛当地时间是晚上，您的生物钟可能感觉是早晨，可能需要一些时间来适应。 5. **考虑飞行疲劳**，长时间的飞行和转机会导致疲劳，可能会影响您在旅行初始阶段的活动。 确保在旅行前预留足够的时间来休息和适应，例如，可以将最初几天的活动安排得较为宽松，预留出更多休息时间。同时，确保在行程的最后一天或两天没有安排太过紧张的活动，使得您有足够的时间回到雷克雅未克准备返程。 总之，在制定行程时需要考虑来回飞行和时差的影响，在活动安排上尽量保持灵活和适度松弛，以确保您有一个舒适愉快的旅程。"},{"instruction":"所以你根据你提的这些建议再优化一下计划方案吧","output":"了解了。考虑到长途飞行和时差，这里对您的冰岛行程做了一些适当的调整和缓冲： #

Несмотря на это, философия может оказаться неожиданно ценной для тех, кто занимается кодированием. Рассмотрим несколько ключевых причин, по которым программисту может понадобиться философия. **1. Формирование критического мышления.** Философия учит ставить под сомнение привычные утверждения и искать логические, обоснованные ответы на сложные вопросы. Для программиста это означает умение не брать на веру первое попавшееся решение, а анализировать проблему с разных сторон и находить наиболее эффективный и безопасный подход к её разрешению. **2. Разработка этических принципов.** Важной частью философии является этика – раздел, изучающий нравственные аспекты поступков человека. С развитием технологий и увеличением их влияния на жизни людей, программисты все чаще сталкиваются с необходимостью принятия этичных решений. Размышления о приватности данных, алгоритмической справедливости и воздействии ИИ на общество требуют глубокого понимания этических принципов. **3. Понимание абстракций.** Философия оперирует абстрактными понятиями, помогает тренировать способность мыслить не только логически, но и метафорически. Программирование тоже связано с абстракциями: классы, объекты, интерфейсы – все эти концепции представляют собой модели реальных или виртуальных объектов и процессов. Философский подход может помочь программисту лучше структурировать код и создавать более понятные и гибкие программные системы. **4. Воспитание терпимости и понимания.** Программисты часто работают в международных и мультикультурных командах, где важно умение понимать и принимать разные точки зрения. Философия обучает толерантности и диалогу, что необходимо для эффективной коммуникации внутри команды. **5. Подход к решению фундаментальных проблем.** Иногда программирование ставит перед специалистами принципиальные вопросы, как например, при создании сложных систем искусственного интеллекта. Философские дискуссии о сознании, свободе воли и идентичности могут обогатить процесс разработки, повысив осознанность создаваемых продуктов и влияния на общество. **6. Поиск личного смысла и мотивации.** Философский взгляд на мир может помочь программисту найти личное удовлетворение от своего труда, осмыслить его значение и вклад в общественное благо, а также поддерживать мотивацию для постоянного обучения и самосовершенствования. В заключение, можно сказать, что философия предлагает ценные инструменты для развития интеллектуальных и личностных качеств программиста. Она обеспечивает крепкую основу для критического мышления, этической осторожности и глубокого понимания сущности задач, с которыми сталкиваются разработчики программного обеспечения в современном мире."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Она имеет выход к нескольким морям: Северному морю на севере, Атлантическому океану - на западе, и Средиземному морю - на юге. Это географическое положение придает Франции значительные преимущества в торговле и экономике. На севере Франция граничит с Бельгией и Люксембургом. На востоке - с Германией, Швейцарией и Италией. На юго-востоке через Средиземное море проведена морская граница с Монако. На юго-западе, за Пиренеями, находится граница с Испанией и с княжеством Андорра. Также Франция имеет морскую границу через Ла-Манш с Великобританией. **Рельеф и климат:** Территория Франции разнообразна по своему рельефу и климату. На севере и в центральной части страны расположены равнины, на востоке и юго-востоке - горные массивы Альпы и Юра, где находится самая высокая точка Западной Европы - гора Монблан. На юге раскинулись Пиренеи. Климат варьируется от умеренного на севере до субтропического на южном побережье Средиземного моря. **Население:** Франция имеет население более 67 миллионов человек. Это одна из самых многонациональных и мультикультурных стран Европы. Большинство населения - этнические французы, но в стране проживают и многие другие народы, в том числе иммигранты из бывших французских колоний в Африке, таких как Алжир, Марокко и Тунис, а также из других частей мира. **Экономика и промышленность:** Франция - одна из крупнейших экономик мира и Европы. Страна обладает развитой промышленностью, включая автомобилестроение, аэрокосмическую отрасль, фармацевтику и производство товаров широкого потребления. Также Франция имеет развитый агросектор с известным виноделием и сыроварением. **Культура и достопримечательности:** Культурное наследие Франции невероятно богато. Страна известна своими музеями (Лувр, Орсе), историческими памятниками (Эйфелева башня, дворец Версал, Мон-Сен-Мишель), кулинарным мастерством (французская кухня внесена в список Всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО) и модой. Франция - родина многих известных философов, писателей и художников. **Политическая система:** Франция - демократическая республика с развитой системой правового государства. На выполнение исполнительной власти претендует президент и правительство, во главе которого стоит премьер-министр.
